Look at all of us running
Always behind, always late
We're always playing catch up
In this human race
All of these young men dying of old age
To feel alive could cost you everything
It's hard to hold onto your ideals
When you've lost your, when you've lost your innocence
When the dreams you've caught
Aren't the dreams you've chased
Now your hearts are bleeding
To keep this pace
The kid you were
Hates the man you became
You can't remember what you wanted
You just can't
Feel the same
Remember what you wanted
Remember what you chased
All of these young men dying of old age
To feel alive could cost you everything
It's hard to hold onto your ideals
When you've lost your, when you've lost your innocence
When the dreams you've caught
Aren't the dreams you've chased
Now your hearts are bleeding
To keep this pace
The kid you were
Hates the man you became
You can't remember what you wanted
You just can't
Feel the same

Look at all of us running
Always behind, always late
We're always playing catch up
In this human race
Remember what you chased
Music city never shines so bright
As the nights when coming home to those lights
All the cities, buildings, and bridges in this country
Can't compare to the love affair between you and me
I have traveled the whole world wide
And I can't find a better place to reside
Every single tour takes me kicking and screaming
Thirty hours from home, my Nashville heart's still beating
(this Nashville heart's still beating)
Take me back home to all the kids in R-town
Who know me for me
My heart's back in music city
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Alert the skies as hell retreats
I'm saying goodbye to my apathy
To all the workers in this town
Losing their minds in this great modern hell
The ghosts have their guns and they will destroy
Buried under broken glass lays their promised threat
From Hollywood to Vancouver, Fridays mean hysteria
As wolverines break out
But tell Sophia and Alcina
We're still kicking it
Take me back home
Take me back home
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Music city
Is where my heart beats
With the heart of a child, my tainted eyes have
Not lost every ounce of innocence
I still fight to hold onto my youth
I won't give into death like you
Kingdom of youthful-minded
Positive but not innocent
We still fight to hold onto our youth
We won't give into death like you
We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing
They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything
With the heart of a child
We will live forever
Children live forever
We won't be misled
We won't be misled
We won't be misled (by broken dreams of wealth)
We won't be misled
We will live forever
Children live forever
We will live forever
Children live forever
We are not a product of society
We are not a sick, dying breed
For the meek will inherit the earth
As the weak watches its riches burn
We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing
They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything
Hallelujah
Children live forever
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
Dreams are the soul's misfortune
Meaningless and insecure
This heart could try and heal itself
But I've gone and lost the cure
In the winter of 2010, I lost my mother to the barrel of her loaded gun
Two weeks later my forgotten dad lost the battle of his lifelong suicidal run
He was dead to me years ago
But losing her was an eternal blow
I've spoke in the past of the broken
But now I really know
If there's one thing I've learned: we're all put here to die
So why jump your turn?
I'm living day by day
There's strange comfort in apathy
I'm living day by day
There's strange comfort in apathy
Lay cold and alone in the ground
Will it be paradise or will you burn?
This is all a gamble
Until it's your turn
He was dead to me years ago
But losing her was an eternal blow
I've spoke in the past of the broken
But now I really know
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Son to none
No home but the roads I roam
Son to none
No home but the roads I roam
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
We're all brokenhearted
These wheels are turning in my head to slowly go
Where I'd rather be instead, laying low
Skin and bones, we know
Made of stone, move slow
Move slow
These are the days
Fear takes its hold around my throat
Lost is the chase
Giving in to distance left to go, to make it home
This heart is bleeding in my chest from letting go
(I just can't stop from needing) Hope in a better place instead
Somewhere to grow (I wish we could start leaving)
Hands and feet won't move
All these things we'll lose
We'll lose
These are the days
Fear takes its hold around my throat
Lost is the chase
Giving in to distance left to go, we can go home
There's a battle for my soul between God, the devil, and rock 'n' roll
And when my head hits the sheets my feet will hit the ground running to heaven
Before the devil knows I'm dead
This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased, waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb
This place is a deadly room, culturing disease, waiting to burn
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine (I need the medicine)
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine (I need the medicine)
Who will win the battle for my soul between God, the devil, and rock 'n' roll?
And when my head hits the sheets my feet are tired of running (and running and running)
This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased, waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb
This place is a deadly room, culturing disease, waiting to burn
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine (I need the medicine)
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine (I need the medicine)
Murdered or the murderers, we're all the same
Kingsmen or the poorly dressed, we're pawns in this game
Murdered or the murderers, we're all the same
Kingsmen or the poorly dressed, we're pawns in this game
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine (I need the medicine)
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head, I need the medicine (I need the medicine)
Hell walks the earth, his name is pain
I swear to God I've seen him
He's no stranger to me, I know him well
I'll write your name into the stars
We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
Salvation for these many scars
We all have dreams at night we're scared to speak of
They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
(Can you hear me?)
Can you tell me what this all means
And why, God, am I here?
We are all the same, we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names, they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places
If all roads lead home, then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by day
Am I in hell? (Am I in hell?)
You've taken this a step too far
We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
We need you staying where you are
We all have dreams at night we're scared to speak of
They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
(Can you hear me?)
Can you tell me what this all means
And why, God, am I here?
We are all the same, we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names, they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places
If all roads lead home, then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by day
Am I in hell? (Am I in hell?)
We all fight for peace of mind
We all fight for peace of mind
We all have hell at our backs
Haunting our dreams
In the beds in which we weep
We all have hell at our backs
Haunting our dreams
In the beds in which we weep
My cynicism was never yours to boast
You've greatly missed the point of what was said
Instead of questioning them, you just followed me
Robots, zombies, cattle herded by others' words
It was never meant to be like this
Breeding your anger was not my intention
Though that be the case, I've made this bed
And now we all have to weep in it
Hate, dissension between brothers of the same
Words meant to provoke thought, misread instead
Was I even right in my accusations?
My words are a weak foundation for your war
Hate, dissension, war
Did I start this?
Hate, dissension, war
I can't stop this
I can't stop this
It was never meant to be like this
Breeding your anger was not my intention
Though that be the case, I've made this bed
And now we all have to weep in it
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
Speak of regretting and all the risk we take
Speak to the morning and when our eyes awake
The patterns are completing, the men they say we are
But as the sun is setting, I'll answer in the dark
When the world sings of all its trouble
And I hear all about its pain
I'll listen in, for its groans are not in vain
It's hard to remember how these dreams were made
When all the reasons and all the rules have changed
There's healing in His voice and freedom in The Name
But these misunderstandings we give up all the same
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
With no place to call home
Run away
From everything you've ever known
Run away
With no place to call home
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
I have no place to call my home
Gain a friend, then I lose a friend
It doesn't matter 'cause tomorrow it will happen again
I'm losing touch with everyone at home
It's really hard when you're born, born to roam
Oh how I hate the line, "Outta sight, outta mind"
I'm on the search for the greenest grass that I will never find
Oh how I hate the line, "Outta sight, outta mind"
I'm on the search for the greenest grass that I will never find
I've run and run
I've drove and drove
Three hundred thousand miles of lonely roads
To see the ones I love at home
Move on and on without me, I'm just a memory
Is this the life I chose?
Have I chosen poorly?
Or has it chosen me?
Will it let me go now?
With action comes reaction
We're all a slave to something
Dreams aren't meant to be lonely
Will you answer me?
Is this heaven or hell?
Is this "living the dream"?
Or is this a living nightmare?
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
With no place to call home
The world is on fire
And I've done nothing but watch it burn
The world is on fire
And soon it will take the last of us
I've heard it said before that boys play games and men live the truth
I've had it all wrong this whole time because I thought it was all braun and brute
All these tattoos and all these miles haven't made me a man just yet
I'm nothing more than a frightened kid demanding undeserved respect
The world is on fire
The world is on fire
I've been thinking a lot these days:
What if hell's not all fire and devils?
All the stuff they taught us as children just to keep us scared and wondering at night
What if we make our own hell every time we cause pain?
Every time we cause suffering there's hell on earth to pay
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose, the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose, the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose, the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose, the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
I've seen my share of heartache but I'm not the only one
My hopes and dreams are setting
They're setting with the sun
The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast down from the Heavens yet never Fallen
He - whom gods hath scorned
Eden's imbecile perimeter ruptured
I am of the Shining One
Whip merciless their flesh
Goad with firebrands
Trumpet the advent of the bloodspray
Enraptured by torment and flames
Broken on the rack crush the cult of Nazarene
My cup runneth over...
Each Nazarene I kill
Is one thorn more
In the crown of their false saviour
A king foresworn in a halo of flies
Prostrate disciples of derisive subjection
Their spirits exude deification of defeat
A talisman profane - vile birthright borne
Enslaving vigour as if nailed to a cross
Scoff at this inheritance of wretchedness
The Daimons erect shatter shackles of deceit
Sons of Vengeance consecrate burning ways
Wolves no longer in the guise of the weak

Gammadion upon our shields
The Conquerors draw nigh
Pentagrammaton - ashes to dust
Unbridled conflagrations purify
Christhammer
Swoon - poison souls procured
Acknowledge the rot of divinity
The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast aside despair in chaos consecrate
For visions become truth in wakefullness
The seeming sorrows that mark my face
With head held high are tears of joy

I am the spear in the wound of christ
Corvus corax descending
Through ashes smoke and pain
Stark sepia sigil of strength
The revealing stench of victory
Lycanthropic ripping death
A baptism in annihilation
Drips from the jaws and howls
An ultimate oblivion conceived
Wartorn...
A solution for flesh and bone
The morbid throne the strong revere
With genocide
Our might makes right
Where charnal houses
Leer at the world
Where crown and cudgel
Ferocity
Rains from the skies
Withered rotted bodies unburied
Lay piled in stacks instead
Vermin swarm and vultures gather
To feast upon the dead
Anthemic holocaust and hate
Stern lord of war and vengeance
Rough beast slouching eternal
Resolves the world to dust again

Wartorn...
Beasts of prey strike with lightning speed
Wagons of war collide
Metallic plague armored locusts drive
Into the storm of steel
Exterminate - feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar
Motorized slaughter panzers smash
Reliquary immemorial of runic conquest
Wincing crablike across a scarred land
Into the storm of steel
Bombs flagellate as poisoned rain
Corrosives soaking deep
The skin of earth erupts in sores
Wounds and filth unending
Winged death - spurting flames vilify
Splatter the Whore of Armageddon
Gutteral ejaculate - mummifying rust
Disintegrating bones to dust
Exterminate - feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar
Petals ripen glisten with yearning
Sanctified vessel inflamed
Fervent fingers twitch the gulf is closed
Envelop the pillar of alabaster
Cockroach entrenches in some awful orifice
Excavating living tissue
Barbaric caress - greased up and slick
pain scraping a backwards bending
Clamps smear open a warm paradise
Ribcage and vertebral column contracted tight
Bars stretched beneath the skin
Lips pulled back and drawn for curing
Penetrate - probing swollen infestation
Fisted into comprehension
Rigid so to bend contorted and suffer
Straight jacket of sadism
Phallelujah
Sanguinary rite of passage
Sweet tongues of fire
Phallelujah
Paroxims of union
Phallelujah
Judas tongue scrapes spit
Bites the hand that feed it
Infectious features baring cracked teeth
Bleeding gums of joy
Phallelujah...
Flaying souls breach the vestal wall
Chorus of angels consortium of pain
Enriched blood of freshly esoterica
Mingles with man in fluid form
Outpouring thrust pelvic abominations
Thick film of sweat grim lubrication
Soon to suckle maggots at her breasts
Celebrate the palsied throes of innocence
Phallelujah...
In the dancing blaze of world cremation
Ashes usurp the thrones of untruth
In the glowing funeral pyres
Where shadows and smoke no longer betray
Furnace fired - matter laid bare
The true nature of existence
Reap the whirlwind
Mercifully engulf the current universe
Reap...
Reap the whirlwind
Unfetter a seedling chaos to spawn
Strip away the artificial mantle
The veneer that pompously claims
That this world is worthy of salvation
Self satisfaction - armageddon
For that is all we can ask for

Every leader a fool with a facade
Every holy man a sinner
Every love a selfish lust
Every war an orgy of laughter
Every living creature a cancer
A defilement - this flesh corrupts
Reap...
All truth is fabrication
Almighty hallowed nothingness
All paths spiral downwards
All answers winged lies
All questions should be phrased with axes
Indulge celebrations enshrined in blood
Astride the inexorable
Jericho's wall shall crumble divine
Grasp the horns of the Dragons of Chaos
Furious we ride...

Lascivious - that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
The tenderness of little girls is not unknwown to me
Ripping sacred vestments - venereal debauch
Frozen phalanx thrusts
Dampened walls summmon hallucinations
Erupting wicked cold that burns like fire
Daughters of joy await the vulgar visitation
Depravity nocturnal - emissive lusts they crave
Inject impurity filth and fornication
A winged satyr raping unsullied maids
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm (of the) despicable unborn
Urinary baptism and licked clean
Eat until it poisons me
Enslaved to those fleshly folds
Erected into bleakness
Unchaste phantasmagoria
The salacious sordid pulse prevails
Corrupting every orifice
Greedy for love
This flesh corrupt
On bestial bloodstained wings
Rites of disgust
The incubus obscene
Lascivious - that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
The tenderness of little girls is not unknwown to me
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm (of the) despicable reborn
What is to be of this pestilience
That makes empires tumble like tears
The dust of millenia - fallen ages
Staunches the flow of dawning horizons
Obscuring -
While the days crumble as their hours unfold
A sensual swooning - prophetic mocking
As the soils swallow the seeds of the past
Each one of us to his own
Embrace
Drowning in hallowed solitude
Swallowing the void
The pallid hope revealed at last
Embrace
*Why should I fret in microcosmic bonds
That chafe the spirit and the mind repress
When through the clouds gleam beckoning beyonds
Whose shining vistas mock man's littleness?*
Throw off those shackles of sufferance
This penance of one thousand ordeals
I wield the scepter of destiny
Choose the means of my own death

Give me both nails and a hammer
Harness those ecstasies of death
Prostrate myself on cruciform
At last...
With swift feet I made my way
Helmed by a cacophony of despair
Deaf to the legacy of youthfullness
And beauty and joy since pined away
Yet now a rush falls upon my ears
Of dripping - whispering words
The hole of emptiness I pour through
Unveils the caress from far beyond
Now no longer can I ignore
What goes before has gone again
The silence of immorality
Satisfied with this one fell step
Plunge beneath the waters -
The freezing embrace of the goddess of death
Awake! Sons of Vengeance rise
Rub the dust of twenty centuries from your eyes
Fashion your being: ploughshares into weapons of war
Today we conquer the self - tomorrow the world
Men of war defiant - to ashes fall the gods
Apocalyptic deeds - fierce archonic might
A knell a pall masking honored rites of spring
The empyreal majesty of abyss winds
An affirmation of struggle
Like wolves closing in for the kill
Making holy our war immortal this glorious night
A brotherhood of iron - falling in we march
Shout into the star shattered Dawn...
We are Sons of Vengeance
Blessed and bold
Reborn in hate
Fingers of scorn fists of furious destruction
Discipline of steel beyond the roar of all war
Unleashed lightning storm brigades to be
Powerful creative joyous and free
There is a land in the middle east region
ruled by black gold
and a crazy religion
There is a satan with certain charisma
he instigates thousands to play the Kamikaze game
the tyrant has the power of words
His bible is built on barbaric foundations
laws from a forgotten century that live again
to die is a straight way to glory
Black widows march proclaim their own slavery
and even children grow to fighters in war
David fights Goliath Uncle Big Satan
the banner of the holy warblood for bloodlife for life
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
A hellish old man plans the overkill riot
he letz his land bleed till end in a war for his pride
it's his demonstration of might
The distinguised expression on face of the old man
his hiding ideas full of madness for adamned deadly game
We won't retain to fight it back
save the ballance land he rules
We'll hold the power on the border
they've sworn the oat
hand die on his order
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
So it's destroyed the work of a century
the iron towers melt down in the fire of hate
No survivor in a war out of gain
pain or glory described in the book of all fates
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands

He is responsible

Rising from the night of time
rising from damnation
growing furtive to old size
a thousand years old nation
Finding victims for their "Reich"
the lands' got a lot of strangers
they call back the crystal night
to burn the war creation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Then the last man of their kind
finished life in prison
he's a martyr for their aims
started killing seasons
Now they march the insane hords
call the "Neo-Nation"
again the right hands risen high
a skinny revelation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Banned graphitti on the walls
words of hate and murder
waiting for their masters call
back in line and order
In a land where neighbours are strangers
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Seventh day restless I wait
yes I wait for the right word
twelve o'clock this is my time
time to change to the nightbird and like
a snake I am winding myself into tight jeans
the look on my face's gonna make all the
girls know what I mean
I come in the music stops
and you see everyone turning
then I walk cool as I can
straight to the bar and start smoking
I feel hot looks in my back
and I'll soon chose my victim
I am the king and my right is to show you
what I need
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
so show action and go
I think of the time that I waisted
how can you tell till you've tasted?
Why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life

My straight face is lying about motions
that live in my heart
like a figure of stone
I am waiting for you to start
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
I think of the time that I waisted
how how can you tell till you've taisted?
why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life
You're running into tragedy
signs announcing danger
for your life
will end in agony
and your bodies will decay to dust
Dust you are created of
and eternal laws can never change
change in our universe
dust to dust decays
You'll roast in flames
with the soals fo no name
your bones burste under mountains of bones
A voice from some
whereis calling your name
when you're in league with the gods
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
Everything that you achieved
all you tried has been in vain
you're treated with indignity
somewhere in a nowhere you will
fight
for the right to survive
don't blasphemise the holy signs
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
you will decay
Somewhere on a border
forced to march in line and order
looo men in greedy hands
Lured with hope for future
pressed in contracts
leaving them no chance
but to leave their land
They're nameless young men
bleeding their hands
on the edge of life
and they feel the hate
treated like slaves
There's a shanty village
where they are folded in dirt
dirt and a mess
intimidations breaking
the free will of men
free will of men
free will of men
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land

Somewhere in a office
noble looking and expensive
accepted by a corrupt state
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land

Locked in a cage
tied with invisible chains
on iron walls of pain
faces expressing their torture
denying their age
1000 years
reflected in mirrors of eyes
and brain
flowing rage
a rage crushing in fragments
past recorgnition their mind
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land

Back to back here we stand
our guns they are ready and loaded
ten steps forward and then turn
the strike of the bullets will hurt you
Eye to eye with icecold looks
that make you feel there is danger
they have might to hypnotize
and they will never release you
You search for the stronger
you search for the truth
you're searching so long
wasting your youth
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search for the truth
fight it out if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search
Search for the stronger of two
Keep cool bleed and fight your fear
Success's laying only in your hands
just try hard the end is near
your name will be sung through the lands
You search for the stronger etc ...
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out
etc ...
You ride on a silver spider
captured in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way to help
You walk through tubes of mistery
you see light at the end
but when you reach the exit
your're cought by thousand hands
You ride on a silver spider
captures in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way
You fall pictures create the lies
You fall but your mind denies
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
don't you lose your dreams tonight
In the night
You sail on a purple ocean
the wind inflates your wings
burned by an old emotion
your wooden sailboat sinks
When flames of memory touch you
you'll see they've burned so long
and deep in a nest in side you
another dream is born
You fall ...
Hold on ...
You ride on a silver spider ...
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on save dreams for me
Hold on every nightmare's got an endEverynight I say a prayer
Look at me: nobody cares
Just a mirror, passing by...
Looked inside:
I've lost my pride!
Stay with me not for so long
It's alright: no needs, no hope
Such a miracle,
looking back...
Times gone by,
and life wasn't bad...!
Lord, light my way
Fill these withered,
careless hands...
Oh, skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh, skies are falling down
Skied are falling down
See, the birds are back...
At the docks and everywhere
Here in Lisbon, realized
This whole world
so strange and divine
Lord, light my way
Fill these withered,
careless hands...
Oh, skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh, skies are falling down
Skied are falling down
Sat beside the meadow
Watching weeds agrow
Cleaned up all the ashes
Of my soul
Wrote down my own sentence
Now you take your way
Fades the last remembrance
Of your lovely pretty face
I, after all,
Just a lonely man - a lonely heart!
Working on the future
Floating on fate
Faced the circunstances
Cleared up the shades, so
Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting, life's been wasted
...maybe I wanna die some other day
Hear the whispers of your hope
The answer wasn't told
No, don't laugh seeing me cry
The end I've left behind
(...the whispers of your hope are left behind!)
Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting, life's been wasted
And I've tried,
Maybe you deny
Words of peace
For the future of our lives
Bring to me
Something else than a broken heart
I won't wait 'till my life is wasted
maybe I wanna die some other day
So, time is waiting
Now overloaded
See, weeping eyes
Let me alone
Angels crying
Back to the war
Angels dying
Rest in their fall
Come to me, try to see
future is not what you wished it to be
'cos everyday seems the same
To the whole mankind
So why still you're standing on the field all your life...
sowing the seeds that'll never grow
season won't end 'till the fine grains harvest comes
We're waiting for the dawn..
The change must start right now!
Oh, scars are fading
seeds now may grown
feeding no more lies
raising as the sun
Angels are crying and dying
for holy chants of
fareweel to kings
overthrown by the purpose light
Nobody ships when the glimpse
of your target comes behind you,
Like steps of the pilgrims unshined!Everywhere, faces I see stare back in despair
Trading places with those faces
Won't go far but you must hold on
You don't know what you've got, until it's gone
And without fear, to disappear
You pay the price, for your life
Hope as high as the mountains,
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside, to stay alive,
And face my fears, with the will to live
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go far, go together and blanket the cold
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go fast, go alone but never back up and fold
Everyday, you have to face the fight, to find a way
Nothing's easy, that will please me
As I search for truth and hold on
To everything I've found in 'til I'm gone
And at the end, my life is spent
I'm facing death, with the path I went
Hope as high as the mountains,
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside, to stay alive,
And face my fears, with the will to live
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go far, go together and blanket the cold
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go fast, go alone but never back up and fold
Desolate
This is becoming
And beneath the feet of us this Earth will shake.
It will take the treasures invested in your soul
As the sky turns red and the oceans boil
From the depths , of the untread, given birth by a distant sun
Apophis discriminates against no one
To turn sand into glass
We'll be done by midnight
When the sky is turned to stone
And its earth against earth
The death of the sapian
The wise and the faithful
Only the man with the reason
Will this notice be useful
Destroyer of worlds
You can black out the sky
Our reasons to live and lie, are our reasons to die
Obscene, is the waste of this earth,
A celestial body for that it is cursed
More then, this plague of man
We yearn for wings and lungs with air
As our reign on earth comes to an end
Suicide, in mind, for a death before our time
The corruption flow is our fatal crime
So hold your breath until your lungs are wet
But hold your loved ones closer, in the darkness, hold composure
We're failing but we're alive
To find your piece of mind
Search in this great divide
Walking blindly, looking through the eyes of scripture
They pick the teachings only fit for today
Man-made gods, moulded in our only image
Blind faith and myths compose all our history
What's the voice inside? My mind is filtered with the moral Zeitgeist
There was no sin,
But the absence of truth in the world
I won't take part in the foolishness held
We die for freedom
Only the wise survive
We die for truth
Paying the price with lives
We abandon this logic, at expense to ourselves
We abandon this logic, at our expense
Let's watch the suns burn into darkness
They don't all have to be from Earth
Be all from Earth
In the white sky view of the future
When time has told if we are worthy or not
Let's watch the suns burn
In the end, when committed to darkness
We shall learn death from truthmy mind turns into my heart
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run, run, run
playing out my very last chance to run
taking me down off this cross
lay me down in the dust
where my eyes cant't see
no more sober words of love
this is my last chance to run
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
to live, to be alive
just run, run, run
take a look in the mirror
my mind turns into my heart
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run, run, run
playing out my very last chance to run
my last chance to run, my last chance
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
the mirror tells me
all I need to know
so I forget it after all
it's all for you
but somehow I my not stop
so I stopped smiling
so I stopped breathing
in all that you did
in all what you are
here I stand
where my past is as far as the sun
in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything
in my head I say your name slowly
for this point in time
I will stop my heart and I'll wait for, I'll wait for you
my life is going to cave in
in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything
when you move your hand over my back
this could be the very last time
the very last moment
one moment from somewhere else
only for you
the bright lights shine
but the truth is I am lost for words
and I will stop my heart, stop my heart and I'll wait for, I'll wait for you
my life is going to cave in
at the heart of the matter
just take a closer look
make it easy cause it is
it's all black and white when the music stops
it ends, so it begins
sometimes I think I understand
everyday I know that
I may be closer to
to something beautiful
you are tomorrow in today
and you will ever be
the you I know is fading away
no guts, no glory
the you I know is fading away
just stand up and be counted
can't say goodbye to somebody you don't know
so it begins, so it ends
I think I ... understand
sometimes I think I understand
allow me to join your presence
no need to argue even for one second
oh what a beautiful view
the beauty in your eyes
the warmth of your smile
a heart of perfection
I would fight the darkest roads
to protect your shining eyes
these are my unarmed words
but I'm not the one
you're looking at
still I did
but doesn't arise
please don't worry about me
I'm already lost, I'm already gone
but you don't love me and I do too
I wish I could
I thought you would
this oppressed soul of mine
got no tears for long time
this is getting wrong
just bear it up and say the truth
as early as your eyes do
this moment will race forever
all my life I was running away
but the sad part is I'm still here
where did I go wrong all along
now I can leave my things behind
cause it's all going off without me
now the time has come
to clear the air and hit the road
damn what we wait for
I've got no time to lose
driving in my old car
mind out!
maybe our backlight has gone
for sure we're already drove too far
just leave my grave undone
listen to the voice in the radio
the tragedy starts from the very first spark
all good things come from above
I'm tired from being put off
I didn't really know how to call it
a name to conjure with
you're a little bit more then I thought you'd be
and now you're drowning me
and get lost in the sea
lost in an oceanI grew up in the cold with frost inside my bones. But this chill runs through me like the cold never knew me.
This reaper on my back keeps whispering an easy way out but I ain't scared of it,
I'm not scared to live and I ain't scared of it, I'm not scared to live.
(Explanation -
This is about growing up with pain and struggle.
These trials and tribulations will scar you forever.
Everyone has their own story.
Most of my scars are not physical but mental.
Although at times I feel weakened by the path I took to become the man I am today.
I wouldn't be who I am without those lessons.
The war is constant, I have overcome & I will always overcome.)
You dig a hole. 5 days a week.
So you can sleep at night, So you can sleep?
Carry the burden, carry the weight
It will drown you one day
And then you'll sleep forever
And your body will rot
The years will bury your name and over time you'll be forgotten
Carry the burden, carry the weight
It will drown you one day
Oh it's hard to see a good hearted kid running scared
Running scared with a tail between their legs going back
Going back on every single thing that they ever said
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
Than be afraid to live
Than to be a coward going back on every single thing that they ever said
I'd rather be dead.
You dig a hole.
5 days a week.
so you can sleep at night, So you can sleep?
Carry the burden, carry the weight
It will drown you one day
Oh it's hard to see a good hearted kid running scared
Running scared with a tail between their legs going back
Going back on every single thing that they ever said
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
You won't get to quench the greed
You won't get to justify the want with the need
You won't get to live beyond your means
Six feet deep
Your body will rot
Coffin keeper
No one will remember your name
Life is so short. If working an office job or the counter at some fast food place makes you happy then you're doing it right. You shouldn't have to count down the hours waiting to die behind a desk or a power tool if you don't want to be there. Find something you love, be the best you can be at it and most of all be happy.)
I saw your ghost it was calling out for me. Do you know where it goes at night because it always come to me
I saw your ghost it was calling out for me. Do you know where it goes at night
Because it always comes to me
The world turns and I'll forever mourn
And I'm sorry that I wasn't the closest
And I'm sorry but I always cared
I could see this coming a mile away
Didn't do enough to show you another way
I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam
And I can't sleep some nights when I see your face
Just to know a life can be lost and just slip away
You were fucked up when I saw you and I don't know if you ever knew
You were fucked up when I saw you but my words to you forever ring true
I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam
Sometimes those feelings affect me. Like I never could grasp the reality of when you left me and that's selfish to say because you left us all when you took your life away.
Haunt me as I roam
You needed something to something to hold on to
I guess theres too much of you in my veins & it's slowly starting to shut me down.
Give me a reason to breath
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave
Tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
& it's slowly starting to shut me down.
Ive been thinking I've been thinking about this too long and I've been going about this all too wrong.
Never knew what to say or what to do to voice these thoughts the best to you.
When I wake up I feel sick.
There is no end to this. There is no end.
I guess theres too much of you in my veins & it's slowly starting to shut me down.
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
Nothing worth keeping comes that easy,
This pain this world won't defeat me
Never knew what to say or what to do
To voice these thoughts the best to you.
When I wake up I feel sick.
There is no end to this.
I guess theres too much of you in my veins & it's slowly starting to shut me down.
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
When I Wake I feel sick
There Is No End to this
I'm staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs. I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind. I've got so much trouble on my mind, I can't describe.
No words to hide the pain behind my eyes
So where do we go from here??
give me heaven, give me hell, give me an answer
ARE WE LOST? WANDERLUST.
Still searching all these years gone by and still no end in sight.
I'm still staring at the sun,
screaming out my lungs
Ive sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
I'm staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
When did the compass break?
when did we lose our way?
give me heaven, give me hell, give me an answer
ARE WE LOST? WANDERLUST
Still searching all these years gone by and still no end in sight.
I'm still staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
I'm staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
I swear with myself as my witness
that I, I'll get through anything.
I can get through this.
I swear with myself as my witness
that I'm still staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
(Explanation - I discovered hardcore, hip hop and punk music when I was about 12 years old courtesy of older siblings. At the time of writing this I am 29 years old. That's almost 20 years later I'm still coming back to this music to escape. To help me heal. To hype me up. To put me to sleep. To wake me up. To connect. To disconnect. To reminisce and to daydream of what could be.)
So So sick of the same thing Someone wake me up get me out of this dream
So So sick of a life on repeat Broken Record still spinning the same beat
Still dying still lying through your teeth
I still see disease in your eyes in these streets ever hour every day every week
Look at me I still remember everything
And I hope you walk the earth alone
And I hope you carry the weight of every lie you spun of every straw you placed that broke a back
I hope your dog blood rots you from the inside out
Get those middles fingers up cause
Fuck the government fuck the cops
Fuck authority and fuck the system
And fuck you too if you're fucking with them
Now whose side are you on? If you're not on mine. You're just a nark, just a snitch, just a bitch, don't pretend we are one and the same, And I'm so sick of the same shit
On repeat like it's Groundhog Day
There's always hell to pay and we are all just die in the end
Life's short, Down for anything,
FUCK A FAKE FRIEND.
I still see disease in your eyes in these streets ever hour every day every week
I still remember everything
And I hope you walk the earth alone and I hope you carry the weight
Of every lie you spun of every straw you placed that broke a back
I hope your dog blood rots you from the inside out.
Get those middles fingers up cause
Fuck the government fuck the cops
Fuck authority and fuck the system
And fuck you too if you're fucking with them
Now whose side are you on? If your not on mine You're just a nark, just a snitch, just a bitch, dont pretend we are one and the same.
So now the lines been drawn in the sand
You better fucking know on which side that you stand
and if there's a single doubt in your weak fucking mind
bet that we all know that you ain't one of our kind
the life we live ain't for the faint heart you see
so do your research before you try and walk this line g
this is for real we ain't playing no games
you fucking lame, we ain't one and the same bitch
I'm a dreamer, I've always been. Some would say the things I believe aren't realistic or obtainable. I've always wished for a just future where those in power strive to preserve the environment, sustain all forms of life and most importantly care for the people. People over profit should be an unquestionable trait in every politician. But sadly we live in a world corrupted by money and status. We destroy beautiful things to create and consume products that are both toxic to ourselves and to the places we live. I would liken these practices of the human race to a disease, a cancer eating away at the world until we eventually kill it. At the time of writing this song there have been countless acts of police violence against unarmed surrendering civilians on the news. These law enforcers are meant to serve and protect the public. They are there to make it as safe as possible. Not to shoot to kill someone who steals two cans of soda. There is no outcry from other policemen condemning their peers' actions, there is no scream for change with how they are educated in serving the public. This song is about endeavoring to being a conscious consumer. Living a just life in all regards. Having fun with your friends, doing what you love and not disrespecting those along your path who don't deserve it because if you can't change your own habits then how can you expect anyone else to. It's also a fuck you to those that don't.
I used to see the world in your eyes All its beauty and its pain
And we felt the same
Now I only see the darkness inside
Only sorrow remains
And I drown in the shame
That I feel better for it
Yet I wonder if I should discard this success and share the pain as penance
For every wrong that I've done, It's wrong that you suffer, For I was your lover
If you're in my heart then you're in my veins and I didn't think that'd go away
But something cut so deep and you bled out of me
And she said "I hope you die, I hope you rot in a loveless grave. Just pain all love forgotten," and she said, "I hope you choke."
"You will beg for my forgiveness, you will beg for my sympathy, and I'll say no. I'll say nothing."
Fuck it's so damn hard... Fuck it.
I was the blood in your veins you flowed through me one and the same but the knife cut so deep and you bled out of me.
And I drown in the shame that I feel better for it
For every wrong that I've done, it's wrong that you suffer, For I was your lover
If you're in my heart then you're in my veins and I didn't think that would go away but something cut so deep and you bled out of me
A house that used to be a home
Now stands empty & the bodies that grew within now walk alone
And she said, "you will wake up one day and realise that everything you hated
was just you reflected and on that discovery self loathing and misery will drown you unequivocally."
Go figure.
And forgive my sin but then I prayed for the day the rains come and wash you away. All the deceit, all the abuse, all the disease. To cleanse the wound, to end the curse. So I can heal, be free of your disease. I pray
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
and forgive my sin but then I prayed for the rains to come and wash you away.
How many years have I known you?
How much time have we shared?
How many lies have you spilled into the air?
And after all this time I've seen so many leave your side you will never realise -
you will never know why.
I pray
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
and forgive my sin but then I prayed for the rains to come and wash you away.
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
I can give and I can run until there is nothing left and then at my end what solace will appear? What should I expect? Broken and a mess. Cliche words but fit my profile best.
I feel sorry for those who have wrung these words so there's no colours left because you can't climb the mountain when the truth comes crashing down on you.
I can live and I can love until there is nothing left and then at my end I wonder if my solace will appear.
I hate this world that I see today.
But I still know it can be beautiful in every way
We all have ugly days
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can be beautiful in every way
Do you know what it's like to be bested
Have you lost have you fought & not won
Do you know what it's like to be tested
Do you know what it's like to overcome
I can fake and I can hate until there is nothing left and then at my end what solace will appear?
What should I expect? Broken and a mess. Cliche words that crush my fucking chest.
I hate this world that I see today.
But I still know it can beautiful in every way.
We all have ugly days.
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can be beautiful in every way.
We all have ugly days.
(Explanation - Don't focus on the negatives out of your control. Keep your head held high, believe in yourself.)
Mother, father what have I done? Where is your quiet son? what has he become?
Stuck inside these walls
Stare through the windows into my soul
Just tell it where to go.
It's got no hope - it's got no home.
I've made some mistakes and I've burnt all of you
I've made some poor decisions and I've hurt all of you
I am I am I am - the same inside but those actions will haunt me until i die
Not afraid to say I lost my way. Walked this path for too long. Am I better off? Am I worse? No regrets just some sad fucking songs.
I'm afraid. I lost. I am worse
No regret. No cure. I accept this curse
Stuck inside these walls
Stare through the windows into my soul
Just tell it where to go.
It's got no hope - it's got no home
I'm afraid. I lost. I am worse.
No regret. No cure. I accept this curse.
Mother, father what have I done?
Where is your quiet son? what has he become? Mother? Father?
(Explanation - We all make mistakes. The only real mistake you can make is not learning and growing from what you have experienced.)
The sun is shining but your blood runs cold, there is a chill in your bones.
And you would swear there is a hole where your heart is meant to be
Not sure why, but your inside is hollow and empty.
And you're thinking some dark dark thoughts, but you can push them right out of your mind if you try. I swear.
"Trust me"
Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long, say farewell
live and let die
It is cliche but every word I truly mean.
there is so much beauty to be seen.
And you're beautiful too kid.
You will be loved, you will be warm.
And these paths in life are meant to be walked.
"Believe me"
Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long, say farewell
live and let die
Just don't give up.
Just don't let go.
I know you won't.
Just spend a little less time chasing those thoughts in your mind and just let them go...
Things are gonna be different kid.
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better and everything will change.
It will get better and everything will change.
Things are gonna be different kid, and everything will change.OH!
Every day
Set the goals, embrace the illusion
This ain't the way supposed to be
Confessed yourself to death
And wore your scare on every sleeve
This candied maxim stays the same
This pained reprieve

Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
Bury me
In this suit I wear today
Another wasted dream
A dream that fades away
Staring at these walls
Inside this fucking hourglass
Just stand in line
This lonely mile
Is bleaker still

Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
It's a long road nowhere
This journeys fate intact

Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
Burn
The fire will light the path
Trade for the nightfall
The pattern is so predictable
Another reason to dream in the moment
Not be denied
I'm not a product of circumstance 
Or a name in a line
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
It's this sheltered life that you're living
Try to recognise
Your choked up words
Are empty still
Fight Blood in the throne room
It's over
These towers fall
Blood in the throne room
It's over
This towers fall
Your lies
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
We're alone
Fear is the change
That brings you down
Blood in the throne room
It's over, it's over
Mirror my lesson learned
Tailored for reason
Laid to rest your lies
It bleeds the weak
This shallow empire is built on lives
Lives crushed down as they tried to fight 
This darkened heart will bear no compromise
And with no thought of weakness
Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
The task is simple
Put more coins in the hand
Now hold your tongue
And lay your loyalty down
Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
Blue blooded tyrants
The faces of sin
They wear the masks
That smile with "mercies" grin
Black gates protecting
Their fortress of lies
It holds the vial of ink
That scripts our demise
This greed infects
Their blackened hearts are reaping
Gold and green
Amassing as we lose the fight
For now we see an altered shade of real
There's no one left to conquer
You're born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
Crusade
To march with a heart filled with rage
A lust for revenge
Traded for blood
Stare as the life drips from the blade
It seals your demise
How easy the hand fits the throat
Your mind so cold and hollow
Will disgrace and destroy
Yet still claim reprieve
So easily
Your faith blinds you all
You the restless martyr
Now receive
A solemn note from callous hands
These are the words you must obey
Take life for belief
Vile actions echo through time
Now raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
Lead the guilty to the rope
Unite and raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
Never forgive, never forge
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
You trail the hounds
That chase your dreams away
Hopeless you are
The vultures lie in wait
Graceless road ahead
Your fate is undisguised
Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again
Dare to fail
The rope's around your neck
Obey the call
When it sounds like hope
Crushed by apathy
You'll forever be lost
Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope
Wake from this nightmare
Step from the ruins
That shadow fates embrace
Break from these chains
That shackle
Rise and prevail
Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again
Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope

Lay your dollar down
To pray before me
These words that i'll preach
Are set to stoke the fire
Raise your hands
This gift of hope I give to you
Your faith is my cruel device

Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
For I
The Evangelist

You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Is this the price of belief?

Now praise
The souls that give will now be saved
My words are lies laced with disguise

Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
Immortal I stand

You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Be forever lost
You'll never find redemption
no matter what the cost
This is the price of belief
What sight to witness
This is darkened room shows no escape
Chaotic bleakness
These thoughts that haunt my will
To be free
A cursed fire burns inside
As I embrace the silence
The peace is fuel for the machine
As I feel
Wrath of fate
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
I'm fighting this solace
I pay my debt with anxious fear
But still I face this
Rising tide of blame
Am I the criminal
Or am I the victim
Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
Am I the liar
In that I must doubt
Is this still real
Am I the noble one
I set them free
Now set me free
Sleep soundly no more
Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
Sit the fuck down little boy
I've seen a million like you
And I wish everyone could see
Cold heart and hollow mind
This story's getting so old and dire
It's rehashed pathetic and weak
Wretched you stand
Desperate you'll fall
You'll struggle in vain
Blind hate so unjust
I'm sick of hearing from you
The lies
Your cruelty without a cause
Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed
Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same
Shameless tainted soul
Your tale will never be told
Denied, archaic, it's echoes are weak
Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed
Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same
Dark reveals
I sense her luring eyes
And her evil intentions
Without a voice
She calls me into her arms
But I feel a cold embrace
The sweet sting of fear
Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of existence
Take my hands
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave
Alone
I fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Towards me she steps 
In silence
Bitter her stare
Can I turn away from this
Our fatal engagement
Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of your life
As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternity
Now take my hand
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave
As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternityRites of death
Rites of undeath
We're falling
We're falling down
I told you we're into deep
Transfer life into what's dead
The act of human playing God
Redoing the acts of medieval
Witchcraft and the worship of dead
We're falling, we're falling down
From our throne, so supposedly high
When we confront the power great
The might of our own creator
Transfer life into what's dead
The act of human playing God
The rites of undeath
Is the testament of our own death
Enter the halls of distant memory
Feel your previous actions once again
Your lies and deceit
Your hate and long lost love
Walk through the hallway of you past
Sense the evil like a whip from beyond
The doors keep on forever
Possibility is endless
Wander through one of the bronzecovered doors
And feel the weaves of old times cruelty
Run from the darkness, the endless void
And get yourself cornered by the demons of fear
Running and screaming through these ancient halls
The presence of something unseen carries on
Of old time cruelty
the past haunts you
of old times cruelty
...save me...
The regrets of all actions that you've done before
has now turned it's way back to you
The demons from the past haunts your soul
Walk through the hallway of your past
sense the evil, like a whip from beyond
the doors keep on forever
possibility is endless
Your ideals are wicked and deceiving
how can you find peace
you seek the righteous, but find the void
Die by the sword of live by the book
Glimpse your death within the scythe
seek the righteous, find the truth
the book of eternal youth
Of generations
cold as stone, you wander still
awaiting your inevitable death
your quest has ended where it began
But is there really a life for me
is there a place to dwell
pleasures of the flesh
vio dolorosa
Of fear and despair, you've wandered
of hatred and grief, you've slaughtered
I've seen you in your darkest hour
I know you as myself
But is there really a life for me...
Via dolorosa, memento mori
In you I've found my nothing
in you I can't hide my pain
in you my love has gone
in you I've kept my cold
Captor of sin, you've stolen my past
via dolorosa
I've wasted my life for you
My hate you create
My blood is water
my life means nothing
my warmth has vanished

The grip no longer holds
When passion abandons
The bonds no longer clutch
And the rope screams you name
A path of daggers
But where to step
A hallway of illusions
Of what was
Duty heavy as a mountain
The battle draws near
Your shoulders carry many
Still death seems remarkably void
You wonder fate in lack of faith
What you consider luck, may be God's will
A wanderer of the light will never die
Before God gives his approval
A path of daggers...
The crown I carry as an aura above me
Is the proof of who my saviour truly is
My mute cries overheard
My blindness is seen
My tears washed away
My feebleness became my strength
Duty heavy as a mountain
The  battle draws hear
Your shoulders carry many
Still death seems remarkably void
You wonder fate in lack of faith what you consider luck, may be Gods wil
A wanderer of the light will never die
Before God gives his approval
A path of daggers...
When love is lost, only hate will remain
I am in pain
I am... the cursed one
Life is not what it was meant to be
What I didn't ask for has now turned my way
Somewhere in a garden it all turned wrong
Things I once believed in have now turned evil
Yet I pray, "Deliver me from evil"
But another spell pulled me away
Will suicide break the ring of curse
Tomorrow I'll be gone, so don't look for me
I am lying on my death-bed, with chaos in my mind
My life took more than it gave
Betrayed and deceived I will now pass away
And with the gun in my hand, my questions
Are soon to be answered
Will suicide break the ring of cure...
Satan and god, the thought passes my mind
Heaven and hell, it's not up to me
If the Christians that I've seen
Represent the true God of heaven
Then it's not a place that I want to be
But if I'm blinded, please open my eyes
And help my now...
Will suicide break the ring of cure
Tomorrow I'll be gone, then you'll be all alone
The assembler of souls absorbs all within his reach
His seemingly perpetual glance of doom
Would even make the smallest of serenities breach
As he rides he wind being the ghost of gloom
Running darkness all around
A knife in her hand
Fall, rising, screaming the name of her beloved
So weak, and so weary
Something blackening her thoughts
A cloud, a force, a weight
Finding her true love lying in red
Is this reality or just a vision in her head
To be the knife as well as the wound
Is all that concerns her
Overwhelmed by a burden, like hordes of fear
The obscurity of the vale of tears
Grasping for safety, which lies all so near
Incresent malice of the vale of tears
Wandering oblivious in the foggy twilight
Shades of an obelisk shines so bright
Incredulous thoughts, bewildering her mind
Is there really a god to find
Halting through the darkest of forests
The obese and extraneous at her tail
This haunting, lingering to the extreme
She is about to quail
Then a formless mass of black, went skyward
Stars began to fade behind a veil of dark blue velvet
She stopped, she listened, nothing
Silence, an eternity passed
The silhouettes of something unseen, a presence
The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring
The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring
Recovering of the dead
Impossible for the living
The making of a copy
Is destruction of mankind
The earth is in it's autumn
The leaves have hit the ground
Corroding this earth is dying
Not knowing, you'll face the end
The coming of Christ
Is the return of X
The art of the Y
Is in the new spring
My hands in the open wound
The knife clutches near
The blood of my veins spread out
My flesh become soiled
This desperate act of loss
The pain of knowing why
My mind slips into a blur
Upcoming questions... as I die
Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled
Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil
Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail
Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled
... as I die
Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil
Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail
Death is my goal / Death, set me free
In my living hell, I can no longer be
Please bring me back home
Where I can be free
These Cowards Awaken
To guard their dominion
Enslaved to the King
A living sacrifice
Raised to see no light
Known to no other face
He edges near with unsteady hands
Struggling to wield his blade
Advancing forth with reckless force
I witness his dismay
Sword and skin, my blade will know his blood tonight
Nearly scythed by his sword flashing forward
Mine finds its way beneath his flesh
He strikes, the worst has come
Fallen to my knees, he looks on in triumph
He did not see my sword go through his back
No longer will the bell toll
The King will surely know
I watch his eyes go blank
His body falls from my blade

I feel my fingers tremble
As it grows closer
I wait for a chance to escape
It prowls this tomb waiting for new prey
Once human, hope has all gone
Humanity has withered from behind its sunken eyes
As I wander through this nightmare
No thoughts cloud my mind
Kill or be killed
I must be the predator tonight
Wasting our lives for this
Fighting a war for nothing
Are we all so mindless?
How can we cope with such catastrophe?
I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light
Blood is shed and bodies strewn
Across the battlefield
Sons and fathers die in vain
Now I will rise to be their shield
Lay waste to their towering castles
Set fire to these gates
Those who are innocent will escape the storm
And those who have sinned shall pay
With their lives
Fuck their meagre existence
They will be purged

I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light

I've had enough of begging
For everything that I want
I'm sick of fighting
For what I've already earned
Dragged through the dirt
Silenced and hurt
When will this come to an end?
I shall reclaim what is mine
Just give her back to me, don't waste my time
I will reclaim her she's mine
No mercy for you fools who stand in line
Then I see her pale figure standing there before me
This can't be real
My eyes are bloodshot, my hands are shaking
What am I supposed to feel?
Take my hand or be forgotten, or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love
You will be forgotten, you will be lost in the storm
The chaos was begotten, now dwell with your demons alone
I shall seek you dead or alive
I swear this will be the last time
Cannot forget you, you're trapped in my mind
I'm done with trying, I'm bringing you home
Take my hand or be forgotten, or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love
You will be forgotten, you will be lost in the storm
The chaos was begotten, now dwell with your demons alone
She's not real
The flaw in her facade, you coward!
You drained the very spirit from her eyes
She lies
She calls my name with the voice of a wretched King
He invokes the collision of nations
To abuse the crown with false intention
Those who stand above him
Live beneath his reign of terror
He is not royalty, he rots beneath the sky
he sits upon a throne he earned from spewing lies
He may be King but he will surely die a simple death
And I will be there till he dies with every gasping breath
The king is calling me to play his game of misery
Inside my mind I find that there's a place that he won't see
Show your fucking face, I don't really think you will defy your fate
You won't look me in the eyes when you call my name
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay!

You couldn't run this kingdom
If you felt further than yourself
The might of the world is against you
I'll have your head if it's the last thing I do
You won't look me in the eyes when you call my name
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay
She sits where the king once did, I have seen the worst
My love once here with me, she does not speak a word!
You didn't have to take her from me, you will know my pain
it didn't have to end this way, now you will share the same fate

This hero begs for incision
He wanders aimlessly
His vision is no longer blinded by his majesty
I've taken everything and yet he still persists
Reduced him to nothing but he still fights for this
I see her face, I can feel her in my arms
I've never felt so close yet so far from her before
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
To find a reason is to burden the sake of my life
A phantom follows him wherever he may go
The guilt eats him alive and scars start to show
Revenge won't bring him back
Although red is all he sees
One of us will die tonight
On that we can agree
On that we can agree
I see her face, I can feel her in my arms
I've never felt so close yet so far from her before
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
But I know my face will be the last thing he sees this time
He looks to the sky in anguish
I can almost taste his hatred
A fire burns where only I can see
And he will spare no blood to get to me

Our eyes meet, there is no turning back
Not now, nor ever again
We made the choices that brought us here
We will pay in anger and fear
Forced to do this fucking dance of death
We cut away until there's nothing left
And with his last shred of dignity
He falls down and looks up at me

I am the god, the chaos and destruction
Behold the powers of my wrath
I am the sword
The burning blade of vengeance
Your blood in my hands
As I embrace the black fire of the end
Ashes rain upon me when heaven is in flames
I am the bringer of your damnation
The judge and deliverance in one
If I say there shall be darkness
All light will die
I rule the world without a sun
With sorrow I behold the demise
The ruins of empyrium
With sorrow I behold, it was fortold
When angels fall, we have seen the last dawn
I am counting hours
Waiting for the sun to set below horizon
Blinded by the light until the
Darkness will fall upon me
And I become as one
Last few restless hours
Until the daylight will reach its end
I am granted with great powers
But blinded by the light until the
The pyre of gods, black flame within me
Purgatory
The fire of wrath inside
I burn alive
Throw of the scent
To seize the chase of life
When one with death no light in sight
I have been told that before the end
The angels will come, angels will come
Years has taken the best out of me
The sharpest edge
Endless burdensome journey without a rest
Murder in cold blood instead of a suicide
This crime is justified
I have killed myself so many times
That for me without a doubt
Heaven is denied
I am here, I am waiting, In silence
With no fear of dying
No more bleeding inside
Waiting for the black sun to rise
I embrace
The depths of oblivion
I am engaged to the escapeable end
The void that once was a strength
Consuming and fears
Became too intense
Destructive
I behold the days that are numbered
In my perdiction
The end has been forseen
I am unable to accept this failure
As weak as I am
I have no strength in me to pretend
The throne that once
Marked my strength
Is now a token of my failure
I can't recall
That the summer came this year before the fall
Leafs didn't grow on trees, grass wasn't green
No lifesigns to be found
It's like a soundscape of silence
The final harvest has become
with bare hands we sowed the fields of ice
Lats crop that died on the ground
Into the frozen soil
Where I bury myself to be reborn
I can't recall
That the summer came this year before the fall
To The land of thousand frozen lakes
Where the endless winter without sun will bury us
Like a snowfall
I have become to question my existence
The purpose of life
The essence of the creature I am
These days will be remembered
As the dark ones
When all life withered away
Death came with me side by side
Our trail across the land
Left only void behind
I have become more than my reflection
I have overcome the sickness
The weakness of my blood
I am the plaque, I am the flood
I have become more than a man
Weak flesh seals inside a god
I follow
I walk the trail
Of my shadow
It walks ahead
Leading away
From the light
Darkness walks beside me

Drifting away
In your now so seeking eyes
The taste of confidence
In my mouth
I want to give you
More than I can
Stuck in ourselves and the distance doesn't change
Words from you
Is a touching expression
Haunting
Bitterness
Is tearing me down
To be with you
Is to be with the world
Untitled reasons are carried with the wind
That autumn night we could have gone to the stars
But you leave me
With that stolen look of love
These days I hear our hearts beating as one
And you know for me
You will never be gone

Does love come wrapped in lies
Am I flying just to fall
And as I grow older
Life seems so much more colder
It's not a secret of mine
That I want love to really hurt me
Your bright smile at dusk
And all my love is blown to bits
Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you
Our words are so far apart
Mine broken, yours full of dreams
But let me find you in those dreams
And take you home tonight
Do you think the sky will ever part
And leave a tiny hope of love
For us to hold on
But to what, why or who
Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you

Serenity
And the ice cold feeling
Of an uncertain future
Spark glow in the dark
Waiting for no one
At the halls of tomorrow
Surrender may I
But only if you beat me twice
(Beat me twice)
I can't see through
Your lies and your crying eyes
(your crying eyes)
So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die
Would you believe a word I'd say
If it was true
(if it was true)
Could you challenge your horizons
Into a voice of silence
(a voice of silence)
Wherever you may fall
I'm falling with you
(falling with you)
And whenever you may leave
I'm leaving with you
(leaving with you)
So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die

And so the day went
We had our time
Now we met at the park in July
I took your hand and held it high
I dreamt that this love
Could be undone
We shared our feelings
We had our moments
Maybe you were the one
No love can ever have a place in me
I'm closing in
On myself
Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate
And so the day went
We had our days
Now we were at the park in July
You took my heart and held it high
I thought that this love
Could now be done
And so the night went
The moon was full
Now we slept at the park in July
We took our lives and nailed them to the ground
I knew that this life
Could now be gone
Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate 
Trying to see but can't break through
Silver skies talks to me like ghosts of the past
Ignoring call from electric skies
And the house of cards
Fall to the ground death
Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still lost in the white lines
Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
A December could only apply to myself
Going to the lake of freedom but water is to cold to swim
I can go back but I can't move
Temptation can burn
But will I drown
Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors

And so may I be the next to know
Knowing the times before they are
Are they deep timeless wanderings and the mace of wrath
In these evenings
The blood seems to boil
Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white
I'm still the one I used to be
But the age of this fiery obsession has been too long
It's now colder than the freezing mind of you
Alive and glowing
Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white
Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
And heaven will know the taste of rain
Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
And heaven will know the taste of rainWelcome to the opposite of all your opposites
No matter where you go you will always be dead
I bring you to the slaughtering of life
I focused on confinement to trade for your time, you scream
This world will pay for your death and we all will laugh when your losing your final breath I don't care
How much of yourself I wanting the freedom you will not and will never taste it
All this time all this time all this time traded for nothing
All this time has given my hurt with the blood that is on my hands
To a spiteful god, confined slaughtering of my internal pride damn this life a broken deal of time
Bring you to your grave, your name has been erased
Your name has been erased confined slaughtering of me
Wait for your blood why I burn innocence can not be alive
We pay for your time for time burn for your life, you will learn
All the confined slaughter of me I don't see through the bars of this disease
I live it without a life without a life a better life 
I scream goodbye, love to a dead world, goodbye
I have to be your wrong answer we loathe this night
It is not what it is supposed to be a better tie to burn
The cold is in my heart created a better me will you accept despise
You why you loathe me I have become regrets
Why you loathe me I focus on all the pain
I cannot begin to feed endlessly
I have got a better dream without you being apart of me
I force a broken reclaim upon my hands, the blood of a saint
I set myself free from this and all disease the winter will take you away
Low below the ground you will find me
Under grave snow, on my head stone
Low below the ground you will find me
I do not want to know anybody's fucking name
I do not want to hear about anyone else's pain
I cannot sustain much of society's ways
I cannot believe unless it is right in front of me
Cannot stop,cannot trust, cannot back away
Keep quiet do not speak, only I can say
You cannot have a word in this your sorrow becomes my bliss
I witnessed a mass destruction a fatal war fought for society's construction
You have no better direction this will be your fucking lesson
It is all about you, you know it's a fact
It is all about you, why is that
Only the enemies know about my revenge
Only few have told the story and lived
Only the ones like this have blood to shed
Only to this world, will you always be dead
Fuck you all it all comes down to you what is named to be true
I have found a separate fixation I have stomped the ground's impression
All focused upon bettering one's self all your turmoil brought upon by guilt
It slowly changes by hope of life fucked yourself by wasting time
Cannot escape your own labyrinth of strain
Feeble-minded you cannot have what you may
I have realized it was all about you I comply to trying to fuck you
It is all about you, you know that's a fact
It is about you, why is that
Instant change from sane to rage unlocked my kindred evil
Fortunate to know the passage I crawled through pins and needles
Enough of this unmeasurable pain all this anger too much too sustain in my veins
Blood boils at a different degree this is the true honesty of what I need
Unknown follow the path I have shown
Capable spite can only be my real label
Face down smell the entrance to my grave
Unrestrained focused to make life my slave
It goes into my wretched core same forced feeling as before not anymore
I will not put up with this shit this burning hate my life has accept
Does anyone understand what pressure weighs this man
Does he have a plan does he have to live
Are you able to hear subliminal welcoming to fear
Why be afraid to be near what is left to give
Does he have to live what is left to give
My beautiful burning hate
Decadence the way I feel about my inner self
Pestilence a sickness I cannot rid of
A hatred that I fell in love a weakness within the system
A saviour has made me a victim a coward that has lived his day
A murderer who escaped his ways a survivor I have not fell apart
At peace with the hate in my heart
Does it matter, all the pieces of your life you have lost
My presence is shattered, open to you for all it cost
It is an honest opinion, an ignorant decision, a life ending incision
This is what always burned, this your messiah will have to learn
Inside this lonely mind hides another danger you cannot deny
All this is, another focus, on my madness
Explain it, attempted misery, addicted sadness
All my torment can it be described all my torment will it leave from inside
All this is, another focus on my madness
Explain it, attempted misery, addicted sadness
All my struggle can it be justified all my struggle amplified why
Every day another struggle every day lived in fucking torment
All these fears made up of nothing all my life tricked into killing myself and the shit about me
Fuck this world and all around me for being in my life and wasting my time
I bury the remains, I end it with my own life I end it with my own life
Failure incompetence rejection resistance this is my natural torment
End time witness end time never alive
Ever find calming all that is forming time no time for lies again
Endless at fault betrayal cause I try to find a better place
Writhe, forever, always held together
All I am wanting never mine it is still longing inside
All the pain's pride, dies crucified unless I find life
Access to life all found inside the veins where blood flows
Don't you ever see forbidden agony alive
All I am forming ties all before me don't you lie
Inside my head you must see endless betrayal for nothing in me
Awful love come to me break the rules bend the bones revenge with shame
Love for me died long ago everywhere I look
Another reason to show why I hate found in everyone the damage of a god
your blood will shed but your death it is the price we have to pay.
The glory of our elder ones is the flame that burns in chest of ours
the light is blessed and shines ahead the enemies will die.
Of the knowledge of my (grand)father's side,
the sword is forged and it will be mine.
At the dawn I take my horse and pride
and to the victory I will ride.
The autumn leaves falling again
Through the eyes of a bird is this scenery seen
How the beauty turns into darkness
And how everything is lost, once again!
Years have passed since someone grew the flowers
Bare hate and madness are left, everything stays still
The place was designed for this
Once it was dwelling for a success
But now is a grave for a story such a sad to tell
She waited for him at the doorway so anxious
She loved him so deeply that she couldn't see
Finally he came and looked right into her eyes
And fired his gun straight into her heart
So crash the dreams of a young one
This life was gone to never return
She started into his eyes at the moment of her death
And that's the sight to haunt him forever
Deepness and darkness are lost in this coldness of hatred
Dream of the loved one has turned into a dream to last for eternity
Cold blooded murder and waste of a life was the only way
The time stood still and the silence covered the fire
Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold!
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories!
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away
Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold!
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories!
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away
It all begins from this point and it's the point for all this to end
Every story has got an ending, but his is the one
That keeps going without it
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me!
I pull the trigger to escape
I have followed the path and walked through the door
I have hated you so much, but now I know
It would be pointless forevermore
Countless nights spent on just pacing under the streetlights
This is the part of the play where the hero is sentenced to death
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me!
I pull the trigger to escape
Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge
No difference has been found!
No difference that I made!Slowly fading image is projected on the surface of the earth
Resemble of the past falling under the foundations of a new era
What is the achievement of men so great that really makes the difference?
At the scale of the universe we are nothing but bare dust
Nothing more than dust!
Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that can´t be denied are lost
Can´t you see that nothing really matters?
Can´t you see what you are doing?
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system!
Setting the traps ahead of us wherever we could fall
So every conclusion is built on empty basis!
World is a reflection of contradictions and is just an illusion
The ordinariness of waking up and going to work like programmed inside
Once you look at it all from objective angle you see how it all works
Master the art of channeling your thinking through the unusualchannels
And become the one with understanding, realize it and program them yourself
Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that can´t be denied are lost
Can´t you see that nothing really matters?
Can´t you see what you are doing?
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system!
Setting the traps ahead of us wherever we could fall
So every conclusion is built on empty basis!
World is a reflection of contradictions and is just an illusion
Slowly fading image is projected on the surface of the earth
Resemble of the past falling under the foundations of a new era
What is the achievement of men so great that really makes the difference?
At the scale of the universe we are nothing but bare dust
Taken my time and gotten only what I´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within
Reflection back burns like hell
I didn´t win, so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow, it´s me who to follow
In sight a despair strong thinking it´s all wrong
I shouldn´t have let go, no way! - I know
Her eyes I see as I close my mind
Opening my soul for her to bind
The riddler comes to me to ask:
"Do you have to hide behind your mask?"
I am not the same I used to be
And now I feel painfully free
Have to forget all the rain
Just to recall the infernal pain
People change, I know they do
Yet I can´t change my point of view
No answer to all questions asked
So pack your bags and finish the task...
(...and die)
Many deeds with no meaning at all
Even so I stand tall
And without a fear I shed no tear
And face what is to come
No more back against the wall
No more roaming the empty hall inside my head
Where all is dead, where shines no light ahead
Out in the distance, for back lies
The essence of life and highest dreams
Behind the point of knowledge
Where the sense of truth so pure and fine
Is cast into the endless time
Taken my time and gotten only what I´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within
Reflection back burns like hell
I didn´t win, so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow, it´s me who to follow
Yet no pitch black letters shall be written
For the future reveals its curtain
I´ve heard the eager call from down below
But I´ll stand tall not letting go!
No pitch black letters...
I´ll stand tall...
Not letting go...
Will let go!
Flashbacks from the war
Calm silence before the fight
Snowy road covered in blood
Suicide by my side
You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore!
Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Just one look through my eyes should be enough for you
Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished
Hearing echoes from the eternity
Still fighting only the enemy differs
Once a soldier so great now afraid of death
One great enemy of men
Forgotten and buried deep those words will be
Time takes it´s own, guaranty's freedom
The last fight is to take place at the frontiers of human mind!
Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Just one look through my eyes should be enough for you
Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished
Weak fire burning on
And the last chapter is soon ready
But the quill drops from his hands
And the story remains unwritten forever
You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore!
Finally I can see it all so clear
The lies and contorted reality
It took so long to realize it
But now I am free from their chains
I know I´m all alone
But I don´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane?
I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the world´s balance
Because I see it all now
I´ve lost these many years
The lost one who´s shed too many tears
Must recall revelation in the dark
For past and future, for all under my mark
I´ve been drowned, I´ve been crowned
I´ve been dead and yet so blind
I have reached the end of my path
The knowledge, the wisdom behind my wrath!
I thought it was all right then
But now I´ll put an end to it
They knew that one day I´ll find out
There´s no way to make it undone
I know I´m all alone
But I don´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane?
I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the world´s balance
Because I see it all now
Everytime I wake up you´re beside me
Every moment I feel you in my arms
But as soon as I open my eyes
You are gone like a frail dust in the wind
Again!
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
This is the silent song of the dead!
Hear the violins play now... And fall!
Everytime I wake up I see you there
Every moment I look out of the window
Your smile I see, behind the mask
But soon the image disappears and
I´m alone again
I´m alone again!
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
When the winds are gathered in one place
When the darkness spreads and no one stands
I am the fragment of an illusion in the silent room
And I am the lost page of the book that the old man
Never could complete
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
The autumn leaves falling again
Through the eyes of a bird is this scenery seen
How the beauty turns into darkness
And how everything is lost, once again!
Years have passed since someone grew the flowers
Bare hate and madness are left, everything stays still
The place was designed for this
Once it was dwelling for a success
But now is a grave for a story such a sad to tell
She waited for him at the doorway so anxious
She loved him so deeply that she couldn´t see
Finally he came and looked right into her eyes
And fired his gun straight into her heart
So crash the dreams of a young one
This life was gone to never return
She started into his eyes at the moment of her death
And that´s the sight to haunt him forever
Deepness and darkness are lost in this coldness of hatred
Dream of the loved one has turned into a dream to last for eternity
Cold blooded murder and waste of a life was the only way
The time stood still and the silence covered the fire
Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold!
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn´t know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories!
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away
Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold!
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn´t know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories!
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away
It all begins from this point and it´s the point for all this to end
Every story has got an ending, but his is the one
That keeps going without it
I´ve been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes

The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge
No difference has been found!
No difference that I made!
Realize the very truth that compromises all we know, all we care
And though the shadows are everywhere
I have come to greater understanding of all the aspects of life
You see, my friend, the universe is sentient, aware, alive
It´s all so simple that way
To live again just another day
But we possess something that can´t be found
The one and only truth in which they all will be drowned!
The revolution of our kind is the center of the progression
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
Claim the kingdom of a thousand stars just for yourself
Use all the means to make the world yours again!
The revolution of our kind is the center of the progression
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
We see into the forthcoming day
Our minds are open wide (Eyes open wide)
And they can´t force us, regardless of pain
To be like them... again!
All these hours were there waiting for you
But the time was running years ahead of you
There´s no sign for salvation in the end
There is no gate to let you in
This is the beginning of a new day
So claim the time and lead the way
Heavenly light that now shines ahead
Is the proof of the new beginning and the end
There´nothing for you here
Follow your people and leave these lands
The hope has forsaken this place
The ship is waiting for you
Please take my word
Our time here is at its end
I have no light or darkness left in my eyes anymore
To see the future, I´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
Now my spirit has weakened and will soon fade away
My sire, your name will always be at the hearts of your people
Leave now, there´s still time for you!
Forget your consort, it´s time to go!
Silence has surrounded me everything that can be seen
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees
I have no light or darkness left in my eyes anymore
To see the future, I´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
Now my spirit has weakened and will soon fade away
My sire, your name will always be at the hearts of your people
You are the only one left anymore
All the others are gone
Abandoned cities and sinister landscape
Is your kingdom now
Silence has surrounded me everything that can be seen
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees
From time to time I feel the same again
The sorrow and the hate for this world
Thousands of sleepless nights in the endless rain
Many days just thinking all these lies
And all this hatred in me
Many days just thinking all these lies
And I am nothing but a lie
The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program "life"
Far beyond the light I am
I´m running as fast as I can
But the world slowly fades away
And so do I!
The reason is the blade of mine
The answer is the fear of time
The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program "life"
Is this what we have been searching for?
Is this all what we have been waiting for?
This is only a joke, nothing else this can not be
All the people and the time and the ordinary life is what we see
How can they be so stupid they can not see?
What the fuck have I done so evil that I´m born here, free?
So I´m born here at the feet of this monster statue
The fear of truth is so hard that they refuse from it
And my personal worldend...
It doesn´t mean just death
And my last words for the mankind
Are vanished with the world itself

Star of Darkness, shine on me
let satanic shadows draw near
the hour of eternal evil here
and I am facing the black circle
see my blasphemous torture
that you lit with darkness
the witches must be gathered
and to stand in your light
star of evil winds, shine
let your shadow down on me
hear me cry out infernal names
near the circle of Ninnvam
the black eclipse draws closer
the witches are gathered
I dream fantasies of torture
and fornication before God
Diabolical night, dwell our souls
let your evil shadows draw nearer
to possess our immortal flesh
and to breed abominations

You are the shadows dancing in the mist
You are the fire lightening the blackened skies
you goddess of sin
that have torched my soul
you are the raging wind blowing through the pagan lands
you are the lust and essence of my being
you goddess of death
that painted my heart with darkness
you are the hatred running through my veins
you are my hunger for the purest blood
you, goddess of vampiric evil
that granted me thy life eternal
You are the pale moonlight reflected in my eyes
you are the wolves howling, echoing through the night
you nocturnal goddess
that granted me demonic powers
you are the twilight in the infernal storms
you are the despain in every enemy´s soul
you, goddess of war
that gave my life a meaning
you are the blasphemy in every sin
you are the pain called love that I cannot feel
you blasphemic goddes
that killed my emotions
oh you, goddess of the eclipse
that dwells within me
oh you, apocalyptical goddess
I worhip thee

Standing on a moonlit field
cold rain whipping my skin
warm blood draining me of life
oh, I feel my death draw near
The pale moonlight is reflected
in the steel that has opened my veins
my life is now fading away
into the deepest of shadows
now it is time to end this mortal life
I kneel and welcome my death
my eyes are blinded by the fire
which has been feared for centuries
here I will burn for my sins
still, there is nothing I regret
death is my deliverance
from this pain called living
with a sigh of relief I die
thrown into the raging fire
laughing as I burn
oh, dark ruler of the fallen
this is my final sacrifice
I grant thee my life

The pentagram of my desires fullfillment
glows with inverted unholy inner force
baphomet, I draw your sign deep inte my flesh
enter me, and use my satanic body for war
Grant me a touch through Leviathan
set fire to my soul of Anti-Christ
God of the underworld, split open my black heart
fill me with unholiness and color my soul in hate
fever runs through my blasphemous being
I am my sacrificial gift to the goatlord
I cry out to thee, Baphomet, appear in me
create a storm of immolation, to kill God
possess me now and see all my hatred
I am a human torch of devestation
master of teh grim domains, I call your names
while I rape the angels of an impotent God

He weeps like a lamb to the slaughter
cast down from his blooddrenched skies
slowly we sail across the river Styx
and I hold up his head by the hair
the godforsaken water is bloodred
and the ruler of chaos stands ashore
he spreads out his blackened wings
and blasphemes sadistically the priest
I drag the worthless priest ashore
he screams endlessly in naked fear
I am an eternal veil of evil torture
and I take pleasure in his agony
he is being crucified upon a cross
and boiling blood is poured upon him
his face explodes in bursting heat
as I whip his soul a thousand times

Summoning voices from distant fields
calling for magic of Satanic might
In midnight storms and thunder
around flaming stakes the witches dance
A fork of lightening cracks the sky
like a blaze in the winternight
still, heard are the hymns
the hymns invocing Satan
The light of day is now cursed by Him
and united is his warrior hordes
the pale cold light of the moon and the stars
now blessed by he who reigns in flames
so, creature of the night behold!
hold with pride your banners black
and to thos that tremble in fear
His voice speaks with thundering might
I have given life to shadows grim
and blessed this world with darkness
now kneel and swear allegiance to me
for the future to come is mine...Caught on an asteroid the size of a planet
Bacterial remnants of humans traverse the stars
As we fall through holes in time
Beneath glares of stars burning
Void of eternal night unfurl

Out beyond the threshold
In worlds yet known to man
Lurking near the portal's gate
Where black holes burn away
VENIT MORS TE SUPERARE
BONUM EST MORTIS MEDITARI
Dimensions shattered by tombs of time
Collapse the galaxy on human life
Outside they wait to cloud the gateway

From beyond I see the nothing
The field which chains all being

Levitated somehow made weightless
Moved by some unknown device
Synthetic gravitational environment
Adrift in the cosmic tide of ice
Lost to the abyssal waves of time
Floating eternally with one open eye
Cryogenically contained living without life
Celestial epitaph for all of mankind

Far below the earth
Beneath the caverns
Beyond the light
Dwells the terrestrial race
And forms of life
Beyond those known to man

Suffocating aura emanating decay
Limbless horror radiates
The fetied reek of plague
Planets burning away
Celestial bodies decay
Planetary funeral
As world go up in flames
Tides of blood for sacrifice
To their alien names
Born of blood and starspawn
In times beneath the earth
Siphoning the life source
Of humans their birthFalling... Fall through the stargate within
but is this the first or the last time again?
Opening between the gates on either side
Spiraling... Awaken in another mind
Fall... Through nothingness...
Suffocating...
The glass freezes inside your veins
Die... Release your flesh to the astral plane
The violent plain of suffering
Your blood has vitrified
Boiling the pulp beneath
Liquefy your mind
Fear the pain...
Fire awaits...
Buried...
Underneath the sand in the desert
Opening how the ancients foretold
Glowing...
With the light of "god" in the temple
Offering thou to the astral beast
They came to mine the planet
For those who live under the ground
Inside the synthetic world we know
As the human mind
These beings are hiding outside of time
Tethering starseeds inside your mind
Rotten seeds grown inside astral beings from beyond
Corrupting your DNA
To make your soul obsolete
Replicating inside thoughts
To make your inner self fall asleep
Caught between the empty fields of time
And dimensions that are lost
To the worlds we know as real

Feel the bile churning away
Mold the substance
To send through the gate
Cosmic seas of fire traverse the void of space
Bringing human souls from another world
Manipulate the species from inside
Watch them fight and kill
To build the mega-cemetery urns of the planet
In this lachrymose universe
Of anfractuous dimensions
No death as known...
Only doorways...
You are the stargateThey return back with the ancient spirits
They return back to kill the living
They return back to take this Earth
They return back to take their own world
Now you can see the ancient magick
Now you can see the ancient gods
Now you can see the ancient spirits
Now you can see the ancient gods
When we closed them in the abyss
They said: "We'll return back!"
And now they are in front of men
Now they want to take their land
When I look around my life
I see damned souls, they don't survive
I see young people, they always cry
They have no values, don't know the light
In your eyes
Tears of lies
You cry and die
Tears of lies
When I look into your face
I see depression, I see no faith
I see young people, they always cry
They have no values, don't know the light.
Rituals, magick
I enjoy me with every excess
To free my soul, to free my heart
To free my mind of shit!
And I know, that I will die
I'm waiting to see the end
If you know what is the light
You have no fear of death
I enjoy my life
Yes, I know that I will die!
And I never cry
But I know that I will die!
Die! die!
Yes, I know that I will die!!!
Rituals, magick
I prepare me to my return
I prepare my soul, I prepare my heart
I prepare me to cry no more.
You that try to take
All the stupid men
You would like to put
Your hatred in myself
You don't need a God
You don't need a men
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else
Prince of darkness
You're nothing in my life
Hey prince! I know your name
I don't fear all that you say
You like to see the death
You like to see all black
You like to see
The decline of men
You think that I don't know
That you rule this world
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else
I would like to know,
What reality is
I would like to know,
What life is for me
'cause I spent all my life,
Running behind my dreams
And every time,
I ran behind my faith
...I ran behind my faith...
Sometimes you need someone near of you
Sometimes you need solitude
You can find yourself, and you don't need no one
You can find your faith, and you can walk alone
I try to know myself
I try with every excess
I try to fall into a trance
I invoke the spirits of dead
When I invoke, my spirit guide
I feel his power inside my veins
I feel his knowledge into my brain
And I keep it inside of me, behind my faith
Do you believe in a living dead?
Do you believe in the other side?
Do you believe that we return back?
Do you believe that we cannot die?
So look at the cemetery
And tell me what you see
In the graves there is nobody
But believe me, this is real
The graves are open
The graves are open, now!
And now we are returning back
To show you what's the life
There is no end with the death
The beginning is in the other side
I don't know where is the knowledge
I want to know where's my conscience
So I look at my heart
And I find all the answers
It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul
I want to know the mean of life
I want to know where's the light
So I look at my soul
And I understand what I am
It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul... occultum lapidem
I'm not blind and I can see
The great light of my will
I look for peace for my mind
I look for pleasures, that I've inside
I that live my spiritual tale
I don't want toopen your eyes
I just want to show you these lies
They try to use your faith and your mind
Stolen faith, stolen faith...
They say: "Give us your money and pray"
They say: "You must believe in our faith"
I say: "Give us a reason to pray!"
You say: "Give me back my stolen faith!".Nazarene
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
Resent me
Sworn enemy of the weakened heart
Cursing the miracle
Leech of the sun
Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way
Wage the war
Madness awakes and reveals its face
Truly immeasurable
Hidden in all
Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn
Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way
Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn
Nazarene
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
We're born to reign as masters
To ashes we'll burn the pastures
Repell their ways back to nothingness
Chaos in symmetry
This glorious victory
In darkness only we can see
Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn
Transcend with rage of the elite
The new order come to rise and shine (rise and shine)
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside
Defiled bloodlines severed
The lowlife's doom endeavoured
The sheep of masses trampled under our march
Set out to lead and create
This power indulge our fate
This era calls for annihilation
Our whispers outsound prayers
We claimwhat was never theirs
Sworn to the triumph of darkness
Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn
Transcend with rage of the elite
The new order come to rise and shine (rise and shine)
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside
Down... insects bow to me
Die... insects too blind to see
Down... disgusting foul flea
Die... we remove the life of thee
Foul prayers rise
Staring through the eye of the chasm
Still at rest but breathing
Enemy be born
Grant us knowledge of the opposition
Spew forth from the earth
Contagious is the one from which the wisdom comes
So sworn
Hibernation draws to a close
Lacerating wings unfold
Hunger will cease
Abominations speak from the dark
Now seek only death
Antichrist!
Rise before us
Pain
From inside
Release them
Souls in slavery
Come my saviour now!
Face is the one of a reptile
Rotting teeth and lips
Speaking words of sick salvation
Whispering eclipse
Antichrist!
Rise before us
Pain
From inside
Release them
Souls in slavery
Come my saviour now!
Cast into the lake of fire

At Kellys' I saw the girls slimming
Bringing in tampons drenched in vodka
Then the party started to rocka'
I was sexually aroused
By these naked girls
Inserting their compacted
Tubular shaped pieces of cotton
Into their vaginas and anuses
Yeah
The strings hanging out of their labia
Getting piss drunk
All these fish tacos dripping, alcohol
Thought I was in heaven
They were bending over
Showing me their "brown eyes"
Moisty, wet and surely succulent
And I could choose any, any slice
So I got out, my hard implement
Slimming party at Kellys'
I pushed it hard. Up to their bellies
Slimming party at Kellys'
My dick accompanied me in endless rallies
Slimming at Kellys'
Think this trend is a good thing
Slimming at Kellys'
Hell of a night, full of swingUp on the hill,
looking down at me.
The hoards are waiting,
for the guilty to be.
Sentenced to death.
Blood sport,
feel the thrill of the chaise.
Heart is fit to bursting,
at the deadly pace.
Hard to draw breath.
I am the prey,
it's jungle law.
Fight to survive,
tooth fang and claw.
Wild dogs behind,
see snarling jaws.
Running man,
breaking free.
The hounds of hell,
are after me.
The gibbet waits,
or to take my head.
Will I make it?
Or will I be dead?
I'm the running man,
I'm the running man.
I am yeah.
Running man,
I'm the running man
...Understand?
In for the kill,
sprint for the line.
Can't break my will,
race against time.
Life flashing by.
Hunted the pack
are closing in,
I hear them howling.
Maybe I can't win,
but I've gotta try.
I swore an oath,
dragged to the floor.
My ghost will haunt
this windy moor.
Forever free,
through blood and gore.
Running man,
breaking free.
The hounds of hell,
are after me.
The gibbet waits,
or to take my head.
Will I make it?
Or will I be dead?
Nobody helped me,
nobody even knows my name.
Fighting bravely,
even though I died in vain.
Whoa!
Running man,
breaking free.
The hounds of hell,
are after me.
The gibbet waits,
or to take my head.
Will I make it?
Or will I be dead?
I'm running still.
On this cold and lonely,
wiley windy hill!
The seer has a message,
it spells out a warning.
Foretold of evil,
from times early dawning.
Lilith is her name,
she'll drive you insane.
From hell spawn she came,
to find you.
She tells you damnation,
is nothing to fear.
Proclaims revelations,
is already here.
Black are her eyes,
beguiling with lies.
With blood lust she cries,
let the night games begin!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Daughter of darkness,
banished from Eden.
She is the succubus,
lays down with demons.
Lucifer's child,
restless and wild.
A harlot defiled,
blind fool!
Queen of seduction,
bewitching the priests.
Lust and corruption,
the mark of the beast.
Haunting your dreams,
insidious schemes.
She laughs at your screams,
the nightmare won't end.
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
She'll take you to the alter,
like a human sacrifice.
Easy virtue incarnate,
she's a mistress of the night.
Priestess of seduction,
she's all your body needs.
Eat you alive,
fuck you till you bleed!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Whore of Babylon!
Roll on up take a look at me,
just a side-act novelty.
Circus clown in the public gaze,
nameless horror to be
feared and caged.
Behind this mask of deformity,
there's a son of humanity.
Formed by natures twisted hand,
they call me monster.
But I'm a man!
Everything I touch,
everything I see.
Everything I feel,
crumbles before me.
I am not a dog,
I do all I can.
Can't you understand?
Wanna fit in with the likes of you.
Set me free,
let me go.
Want to belong,
I need to grow.
But you treat me like a
freak show!
Freak show!
I'm nothing but a Freak show.
Freak show!
Mirror your insecurity,
imperfect, scarred,
just leave me be.
Need a place where I can hide,
no one sees the wretch inside.
Stripped of pride and dignity,
mocked by cruel society.
Thought you were my only friend,
now I can see you just pretend.
Everything I knew,
everything I crave.
Everything I do,
brings me closer to my grave.
Too grotesque to live,
but too young to die.
Madness, cruelty reigns,
torment clouds my brain.
Hatred,why is it so?
Need to belong,
someone you should know.
But you treat me like a freak show!
Freak show!
I'm nothing but a Freak show.
Freak show!
What do you want from me?
Cut me do I not bleed?
I'm every bit as good as you.
Out cast,beat down betrayed.
Lost in a world I never made,
I'm insane after all they put me through.
Set me free,
Let me go.
Want to belong,
I need to grow.
Oh they can't even look me,
Right in the face!
...Subhuman!
Let me show you,
the creature I've become.
The evil that torments the soul,
when prejudice is done.
Freak show!
I'm nothing but a Freak show.
Freak show!
Freak!
freak!
freak!
freak!
You treat me like a freak show,
freak show!
I'm nothing but a Freak show,
freak show!
(Voice over)
Roll up roll up,
See the inhuman monstrosities.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you ...FREAKS!
Too bad the boy can't sing,
but kids today'll buy anything.
Sweet meat,
supplying trash on demand,
for a few dollars more.
In the back of a hand.
You'll go far It's true,
every two bit actors
a rock n' roll star.
In the charts on the news,
with millions screaming
all over you.
It's Prime Time!

Doing prime time!
Slave to convention,

Red hot the kid can play,
but where's the pay off
at the end of the day?
Looses heart,
playing one night stands.
Never got a deal,
soon quit the band.
He was good,
goes to show.
It ain't what you do,
it's who you know.
That's the catch 22,

you'll never break through.

It's a fashion reaction,
Pigeon hole philosophy.
The people only get,
what we want them to see.
Gonna sell 'em the illusion,
till it hurts and they'll pay.
A little bit of hype goes a long,
long way.
Foundations of rock,
Have feet of clay,
Gone tomorrow,

Never pay no heed to those
who oppose my lifestyle
Feel no remorse for the wrong
that I've done
I constantly abuse all who try
to use me
Like a fallen angel banished
from the sun
Cause I'm the Night Stalker,
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker, assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attack
Prowling these streets at night,
I fight a deadly game of survival
Stealing through the concrete
jungle with bloodlust in my
brain
All here fear me I'm ruthless
as I'm godless
A preadtor of the side walk in
his alley-way domain
Cause I'm the Night Stalker,
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker, assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attack
Society brands me a homicidal
madman, but they cannot
cage what they cannot see
When I'm coming you as
good as a dead man
Ain't no one alive that can
elude me
Cause I'm the Night Stalker,
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker, assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attackEvery last blind pulled when I walk down the street.
The only sound I hear is my tired heartbeat.
Sometimes I feel just like a motherless child.
This place once had a name.
The people once had faces.
In every town I find it's the same sad situation.
Sometimes I feel just like a countryless man.
My father tried to break me, my mother she tried to raise,
The county correct me from my wild ways.
I once saw figures about a mile off.
So I waited in the woods until they were gone.
Sometimes I feel just like a wandering dog.
My father tried to break me, my mother she tried to raise,
The county correct me from my wild ways.
Struck down by a vision of beauty
Said I was struck down by a long legged archer
Oh the city was hot, but my blood ran cold
Oh, the city went dark, keep calm and carry on.
I was a young man, only 19 years old.
I was a young man so very far away from home.
Ah she got me, struck down, right through the heart, struck down.
Ah she shot me, struck down, right through the heart, struck down.
Keep calm and carry on, reefer madness quiets the falling bomb.
I want to be an old man, damn you, von Braun.
I've been laid low by a blinding light.
I've been torn asunder by the banshee's wail.
Ah she got me, struck down, right through the heart, struck down.
Ah she shot me, struck down, right through the heart, struck down.
Keep calm and carry on, reefer madness quiets the falling bomb.
I was a young man, only 19 years old.
I was a very young man so very far away from home.
I was imprisoned by a vision of beauty.
I was struck down by the long legged archer.
Keep calm and carry on, reefer madness quiets the falling bomb.
Airstreams tethered together like silver sleeping oxen
All the best locations are located on the margins
Suited for telescoping the interstellar scene
It's a mean killer in the daylight, but that's life for you and me
It's a reliable source of information.
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts.
Anthrax, ham radio, and liquor.
What if I told you they been lying
About that double wide with water rights?
And now the town cars are back again!
They sold you some old line
About the greater good and sacrifice
Your friends from Langley are back again!
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts.
Anthrax, ham radio, and liquor.
Coming at you live!
It's just some people can only see the stars
In the reflection from big black cars.
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts.
Oh Abraham Lincoln, carried across the street.
Oh Abraham Lincoln, carried across the street.
The assassin, the coward,
shot him in the head.
The assassin, the serpent,
Struck him then he fled.
Oh many many many people, gather to hear the word.
Oh many many many people, tremble at what they've heard.
Snickering, drunkards, from cover of dark.
Treachery's their master,
murder is their heart.
From the table, rips his chair.
Cross the people on the stairs.
Watch the limbs running for.
All across a empty bar.
Oh Abraham Lincoln, buried him in his grave.
Oh Abraham Lincoln, buried him in his grave.
The assassin, the coward, no grave for you.
The assassin, the actor, no applause for you.
From the table, rips his chair.
Cross the people on the stairs.
Watch the limbs running for.
All across a empty bar.
In a city of crooked alleys,
Crookeder women and wicked men.
Dim lamps in the rumor mill
Suspicious kith and unkind kin
Haruspectre General
Sleeping soldiers in the field
Below the elders conspire
To turn the merciless and massive wheel
Strange cousins from the west overstay their welcome
Locked in among skeletons
Broken hearted and damned
Sorry to have to break it to you friend
But life seldom goes exactly as we plan
Strange cousins from the west overstay their welcome
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them?
The city's always thriving
Hungry bellows of the Minotaur
Everyday more are arriving,
And everyday it requires more
Unexpected circumstance
We must not delay
You have all been so very very kind to us
And we will return the favor one day.
Fate is the idiot's excuse!
Freedom is the sucker's dream!
But we hope you find some measure of comfort
In considering us to be your family
Strange cousins from the west overstay their welcome
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them?
In the raining park the chessmen play,
The faithful atheists refuse to pray,
The steam-works weep, the addicts do not care,
Crowd of cold people stand by and stare
The garbage eaters, their many retainers
Come to collect all the foul remainders
The smoke hangs heavy, the wrecking ball swings
In the clockwork of a collapsing thing
Wasted plastic empire's golden age, chemical wedding
Citizens in their refineries cheer the nuptial bedding
The hourglass is turning
On a shore of iron, cutters, and clippers
Paper, rock, rock, paper, and scissors
On a road of skulls their story moves on
It's a bumpy ride and very, very, very long
In the blue sky the seagulls fly over garbage.
Are we the ocean? Are we the desert?
Are we the garbage? Who's to say?
I'm gonna move to the outskirts of town
Where none of your friends are hanging around
That's right, I'm gonna move to the other side of town
Where none of your business is hanging around
Woman, please let a poor man be. Let a poor man be
Columbia, girl, please let a poor man be. Let a poor man be
I'm gonna build a castle out of Goodyear tires,
Cinderblock and busted doors; that's where I'll retire.
Gonna dig a mote. Fill it up with ale.
Not much of a defense, I know, but the supply never fails.
When you come knocking all in tears wringing hands and genuflecting,
You'll understand that I am a busy man and my subjects demand my attention.
These walls don't build themselves and I am running out of time.
So if you desire anything else, you had better get in line.
What kind of ugly are they talking about?
It's just straight up cold evil.
What kind of nonsense are they going on about?
Do they suffer from the fever?
Nothing's gonna satisfy them
Till it all goes Chernobyl
No, nothing's ever really gonna satisfy them
Until the virus goes mobile.
If you didn't then well now you know
Outside is an army of antlers
I hate to say it but I told you so
Only the freaks have all the answers.
Red threat! Helicopters! Super-Mind-Control!
Stockholm Syndrome! Love your captors!
Uranium! Super-Mind-Control.
It's gonna rain, rain down in buckets.
Watch it happen, a natural fact.
They're gonna lose and their not gonna like it.
Watch it happen. Supernatural act.
I send pictures through the mail
Well documented and very detailed
To politicians and big celebrities,
But none of them are believing in me
And I await their response
Some send none, most send cops
But man it's a dire situation
And I will risk the public humiliation
Sleestak lightning on my trail
It's a dire situation, they are on my trail
West Virginia has its Moth Man,
Pan handlers' got their Skunk Ape.
But I have a tazer and night vision goggles,
Costco rolls of black duct tape.
It's got red eyes, it's got razor claws,
It's got green skin, no it ain't a meth-head.
And after studying its behavior, objectively and critically,
I believe I have a reliable method.Path ingrained fall face first into nothingness
All roads lead me to self-destruct
Veins are maps paving way to the abyss
Up is down and from this there is no escape
Drown down and out
Gates without keys eyes without holes
Life without answers a corpse with no soul
Born under the worst sign Revelations of an innocence lost
From the cubicle to the casket life is a mere lottery of loss
This code of damnation ineffable to in it's beauty 
My race to the grave is my birth given duty
My race to the grave is my birthright
My inborn malignance manifests failure complete
I know I'll never leave this shitball alive
My insurrection versus resurrection let's me know
This name dies with me
This depravity this futility
It's synonymous with family
Fuck you forever and fuck me
I deny both idols and hope
I reject this holy hoax
At the end of my noose
Fuck the son long live the beast
There's an itch in my throat only a gun can scratch
Enraptured by the glow of armageddon of which you already know
The black void twists and turns and calls me home
A vendetta for revenge and bloodlust to die
To watch it all come to an end preaching sermons of sleaze
My advice? Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death
Who would call this shitball home?
Who wouldn't be best served
By feasting at the funeral knell?
Who hungers not for decay?
My advice? Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death
The preaching of psalms denied
Extinguish the light it shines no more
Of servitude and supplication
Bring on nuclear winter
Feast
Drown in silence and servitude
Requiems for the lifeless
Damnation and downfall
The two gifts of life
Feast
Extinguish the light it shines no more
Who hungers not for decay?  Bring on nuclear winter
Bring an end to this curse
Torrents of blood cover the eyes of the lost in a discordian blanket
To bury the illusions of those not silenced from slit throats
Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed
The power of mercy is now extinct
Black-gloved hands knives to throats
These are the new messiahs
Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed
Putrid breath of life how I hate you
You burn all you touch with gifts dual
Of misery and awakening
A rotting sentence that walks and kneels
All that prays kneels and dies
Arms outstretched on bended knee
All that walks kneels prays and dies
Tongues of ice tongues of fire
All shall burn in the funeral pyre
Arms outstretched pray and die
We exhalt
Annihilation we are your guides let us be your eyes
Let us hold hands united in the great uncoming
Of that which is perfect
We bow great bringer of night
Choronzon's dawn we embrace you
Offer forth the benevolent
Tentacle of futility
Whispers of obliteration echoing nigh
Bring down the summer of finality
We huff your rot now come forth
And carry us home
Bear benevolent gifts of decimation
Our congregation of the end
Welcomes you
Forever and never of ways
And impossible
Great breaker of worlds
To thee great king
Let us be your vessels
For the great uncoming
Always and impossible
Great destroyer of life
We huff your rot
The tragedy of the excommunicated
Forever and ever always impossible
Soliloquies written in blood
As we were all born so shall
we die alone
Baptised in scars crowned in agony
Conceived with the futile notion of the self
could ever ascend
A swine existence for this plague of mortals most foul
Rip the skies asunder to draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
Shower mortals with the remains of their kin
There is nothing left worth saving
And even less worth dying for
The ultimate blessing is silent sleep
Forever as it was once foretold
Rip the skies asunder and draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
Dog eats dog eats man eats self
The packing order of the leprous
Fundaments of failure embodied in man
Begotten signs of faith drop lifeless
Under the velvet of no promised tomorrow
A swine existence for his plague of mortals most foul
Rip the skies asunder draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
O great lord shower us with shit and piss
O great lord give meaning to this outrage
O great lord bear the vestige of the atom
O great lord in glory Annihilus
O great lord let me consume your suffering
O great lord let me waft the fumes of your corpse
O great lord I inhale your pestilence
O great lord shower us with your death
O great lord
We are all but blood on Satan's claws
Rain down plague to wash down famine
Bathe us in the waters of death
Shower us with fire eternal
The cleansing when all became none
Congregate flagellate
We the downtroden beg you
Correct this most grave of mistakes creation
We who exhalt in the end worship it
We beg for baptism in blood in sinew
Snuff us out
Burden us not with the disease of tomorrow
Wrap us instead with black wings of sorrow
No prayers sent up to an empty sky
Sink for fangs deeper into our necks
We who exhalt in the end worship it
Baptise us all with blood
Baptise us with humanity's eulogy
The end when all became none
If the streets are sewers the churches are abbatoirs
In case of rapture the car might be unmanned
But the gun tower won't be
Send us back to the vapor of the ether
Rain down plague
When all became nonewe were born without eyes 
and the sockets were just break proof safes, 
read these books and diaries, 
that's how they said we could start clean, 
but, I would rather staple my own hands to a train, 
then pray on knees that judge and blame.
If I could better myself, I swear I would,
I swear to god I'd fucking change myself 
but the five billion hands of the world are pulling me down.
My veins are turning a dark blue,
I feel like dying, how about you?
Take the coins out from under your tongue
unsew the pockets because I am holding on to nothing.
Drown, drown, I'd fucking drown without you.
If I said you were the only one
who could pull me out of this one
would you think it was fiction?
I don't remember the good ones from the bad, 
But it's too late because 
I can't hold back from the bucket of bruises.
Brothers and sisters, our lease is way expired now. 
Drink the youth.
Drink the youth.
The stomach holds heavy circulations, 
Our scariest secrets and pleasures
Fuck us front to back,
Save our teeth and maybe our copies won't melt under the light
We could build a city in a single day, 
but in a couple of seconds we would try 
to bury our regrets.
They don't make caskets like they used to, with escape buttons. 
So grab my chest and slip your fingers
through my ribs, hold on to this blood machine inside
because its all about to end.
They said we might not come back from this one,
but who fuckin' cares,
at least it will make us into humans.
Shape my legs until they walk on order,
shape my eyes so they wont tear up on command,
shape this heart and make it harder than forever, 
but remind me never to stick my hand out the window, 
because its worth more than your breath.
So what if your teeth hold a grudge,
so what if your grinning means nothing, 
I bit my own hand clearly right off
I can't keep my mouth busy, I can't back up my spit. 
The cursed, no one can change us.
The spells, no one can take us. 
I'm tired of your breaking downs,
keep us away from your maybes and your killing downs.
The heavies hearts can keep from breaking down,
churning, grinding itself into slumber.
A plague on both your plans,
but it's too bad that the prettiest smiles can taste so awful.
Burn the quakers, 
learn,
don't catch fire,
burn,
now, can you make some pictures with your fingers?
What's that father, father?
It wasn't gravity, it was the witches.
Make your fingers into pillars 
hold all the stomachs in this town, 
they can't stomach anymore. 
The wood on these trees smell like skin now 
and old fires are full of carpenter stories,
where they push plastic nails through their smiles. 
It wasn't gravity, it was the witches. 
Just wait till they cook up a cure for ignorance.
The last time we spoke, we ended up no where
and it seems like my words
aren't any better than your quotes, 
our speeches were reversed
just like the movements of our hands, 
with every sentence I became more afraid
I remember every sentence and I remember every word,
because through this mirror
I thought my words would come out backwards
and your mouth is just a reflection of what I can't swallow.Realms above us
Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't
[PreChorus:]
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
[Chorus:]
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, yeah !
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again
[PreChorus:]
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job
[Chorus:]
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
Death tone
Death tone
Gonna ride on my death tone
Yes I am
I'm gonna ride on you baby ! Oh !
I hear the sound
In a metal way
I feel the power
Rolling off the stage
Cause only one thing
Really sets me free
Heavy Metal
Loud as it can be
Baby I was born to play music
I'm a man with a screamin guitar
There's a light in the middle of the stage
In a minute I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans
And a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share
[Chorus:]
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Living like there's no tomorrow
Yeah Currie says we're on the edge
He says man you're really graphic
This band a social wedge
Yeah we all got hearts made of metal
and our blood is hot molten rock
And if I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock
[Chorus:]
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal
So mister D. J.
Play just one for me
You know the one
With the crushin' and the screams
'Cause only one thing
Really sets me free
Heavy metal
Loud as it can be
[Chorus:]
Heavy metal, metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal, heavy metal daze
heavy metal, heavy metal daze
Heavy metal
Loud as it can be
Mama's having problems,
Always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like bein' free
The truth is in the mirror
It's what they never see
I said yeah
A long time ago
They tried to tell me, son
Keep our daughter home
I said no no, no no

Now, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away

You're only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough for a trip around the world

Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching "Billy Graham" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me

Now do it right with the music
Then you'll learn how to use it
All night, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away

Mama's having problems,
Always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like bein' free
The truth is in the mirror
It's what they never see
A long time ago
They tried to tell me, son
Keep our daughter home
I said no no, no no

Now, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away
I don't know
Well, there's no charge for the haircut
And the bullets come free
My Uncle Sam sent a letter, said:
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger, not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone, gone, yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm M.I.A.
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a B.A.R.
I know I'm home
But I feel gone, gone, yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked, whoa
Shell shocked, whoa
Shell shock
Shell shock
Shell shock
We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight,
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah, Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye,
Took his land and fortune,
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline,
Left for the tide,
Sees his life-blood leaving...
Circling lower, the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
And they take him where no one sleeps while the undead cry,
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry...
And in the world above
The elders sing,
On his land they live...
Let death's bell ring
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him,
"Let ye not pass Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thine own anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged."
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called: Black Death
A grim steed
So fiersome in might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness...
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder!

[Chorus:]
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you

[Chorus:]
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching, watching
Hoping to gain their lives
But when I'm through they know that they must pay

[Chorus:]
Burning, death, destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives

By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride

[Chorus:]
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
Victory, victory, Oh !
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses, men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side

[Chorus:]
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !
Kill, kill, Oh !

Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather...
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again, no he won't

[Pre-Chorus:]
Now, you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job

[Chorus:]
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight, yeah!
My social workers
Got me on a chain
Keeps me out of jail
So the paper prints his name, yes it does, and he likes it
Unemployment checks
Run out next week
It won't be very long
'Til I'm back on the streets again

[Pre-Chorus:]
Now, you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job

[Chorus:]
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me ride
On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight
Death tone
Death tone
Gonna ride on my death tone
Yes I am
I'm gonna ride on you baby! Oh!

Mama's having problems,
Always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like bein' free
The truth is in the mirror
It's what they never see
I said yeah
A long time ago
They tried to tell me, son
Keep our daughter home
I said no no, no no

Now, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away

You're only sixteen
A woman, not a girl
Old enough for a trip around the world

Pick you up on Friday
When your daddy goes to sleep
Bring you back on Sunday
When he's watching "Billy Graham" on T.V.
Oh yeah, he won't see me

Now do it right with the music
Then you'll learn how to use it
All night, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,
Aaaah

Fast Taker,
Bed Breaker,
Love Maker
Take it away

Mama's having problems,
Always comes to me
Your daddy's been a drinker since nineteen forty-three
They tell you I'm a loser
'Cause I like bein' free
The truth is in the mirror
It's what they never see
A long time ago
They tried to tell me, son
Keep our daughter home
I said no no, no no

Now, I don't mind them saying
That you should be praying
For me, a fast taker
Right here's where I'm staying
Life's a game I play for keeps,

When you see me comin' flying down the road
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin
Black'n'chrome flashin' through the town.
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a god-damn
bad machine, young'n'hungry, not too proud'n'mean
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Riding, riding, riding, ain't never growin' old.
Take what I want and I go where I please
Got the world right by the balls. This world ain't
big enough to keep me down. Yea we're livin'
in a sick world. The man on the T.V. said we
got lotsa trouble overseas, well what the hell
do I care? Think they care about me?
Stop sending money send'em all a bomb.
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.
Well they all want to know what people say is true,
You know, get a biker started 'n he'll drive all
damn night. Well hold on honey 'cause this ride's
for a ride.
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
I'm the WARLORD of the road.
Ridin', ridin', ridin', ain't never growin' old.

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows
Black is the forest, white was the snow.
There as children, how could children know?
One without name or number soon would show.
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,
And the great sword of steel.
Sons of destiny shall wield.
Hear Wisdom's voice.
Rise, know the strength that you feel.
Hold in your heart but never reveal.
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.
Guard well the secret of steel.
Hear the pounding army of the night
The call of metal summons us tonight
And gather we on this site
To behold the power and the might
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night
Off with the lights, hear the screams
See the banging heads awaken to their dreams.
The sound of metal so loud it cracks the beams
Played by warriors called the Metal Kings.
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.
We are together, we are all.
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.
We are together, we are all.
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea
Leather, Metal, Spikes and Chains
Gloves of Metal raised to show the brave.
Into the darkness march the armies of the night.
Bound by metal we live the fight.
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand.
Hands high forever we'll be there,
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land.
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal, I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky.
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing, as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride.
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me.
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand.
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge, endless time
I scream the final battle cry.
I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart, from evil it was made
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil, let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked, know the gruesome pain
I am the omen, the one that cannot die
I am the flame, hatred burns inside.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
I crush your bones, I kill your face
I rip your flesh, I end the chase
You meet with terror, you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race.
My strength is hatred, torment and pain, HATRED, HATRED
With heart filled hatred black blood runs through my veins.
HATRED
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke, there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man.
What was written foretold in dreams,
in visions apocalypse now seen.
And all self-righteous fools who lived and blasphemed
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication, he is coming on the clouds
See his angels, hear their trumpets sound.
The day of anger when the stars fall from the sky
The moon turns red, the sun turns black as night.
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
His hair as white as wool, his eyes like burning flame
He is the first and last, he brings the seven plagues
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
He holds the keys of death for the underworld and man
Know the end is coming, heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Revelation, the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon, the first trumpet blows
Hail, fire and blood fall on Satan's throne.
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear
Black winds blow where we ride near.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last.
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past.
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
For when we march, your sword rides with me.
You who killed my brother and all who take your side
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can.
Death is life!
By the full moon they rise from their graves.
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.
Three sons have I, and they
Ride by my side. The fierce,
The black, and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.

Mighty messengers-heathens rage
Witness our coming-gods of the dead.
I ride through the air-
I laugh as I die-with powers of evel
Dark knowledge is mine.
The ride of the wicked-
The firstst sin was trust.-
Kill without warning-for blood now
I lust

Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.

Three sons have I,and they
Ride by my side.-The fierce,
The black,and the wicked are
their names-we ride down my
enemies on their half-hearted flight.
No voice of mercy-no evangels of light.

Strong wind-magic mist
To Asgard the Valkries fly
High overhead-they carry the dead
Where blood of my enemies lies.

Passing through the storm-
Led by Demons-walk between the
World of men and gods-
Cast no shadows-draw no light.
I rape the priestess on pagans night.

I taste the serpents poison
On the lips of the one I love.
She brings this gift of witchcraft.
I wear the cat-skin-gloves.

Apples of youth when I wrought
Mischief,hung in a tree to rot
In the sun.-
Reborn in the middle of the
Final orgy the gift of slavery
To the chosen one.

Suicide Suicide don't you know
Me-call to the Master-he will
Come.-He will bring out
Ressurection-cloaked in darkness-
He has won.

Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Each dawn I die.

Smoke of my sacrifice.-
Journey to the Isle of the
Blessed.-
Grant my soul your glory.
At night time-I'm your guest.
Only I know why-

Hear what's written on the wind.
We come to kill and kill again.
Our arrows fall like hail
Trample on the dead-Ride through the
Gate of clouds-stand on the open step

Run berserk-spreading fear and pain
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.
None can harm us-not their fire-
Iron or steel-for we have the
Will to power-with power we will
Kill

Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

To the war god Odin you will pray
And the curse of weapons shell
Remain.On the blood of all our
Fathers-on their weapons we now
Swear to evenge-not lament.
Give the False ones death.

Kill with power-die die
Kill with power-die die

Raise sails head for the open sea
With sails full of wind-our hearts
Overflowwith belief.

The quest for the grail to England
We sail,with our steel.We
Bring what was lost.If
Lives are the cost,let it be.

Strong she stands-reaching her
Hand.Brave and grant.On English
Ground-we were born.Proudly
We return.-To English shore.

Hail,Hail to England-
Hail,Hail,Hail.

We march from the hills
Down to London Town.-
Join Raise you hand-or hide
When we ride for the crown.

Signs of the hammer and
The black winds blow through
The night.Long was out wait
Our meetings with Fate is tonight.

Strong she stands-reaching her
Hand.Brave and grand.On English
Ground-we were born.Proudly
We return.-To english shore.

Hail, Hail to England-

Standind tall-one and all-
Light the hall.

Years have passed-I've dreamed
of this day.
As we raise our hands-we

Hail,Hail to England-
Hail,Hail,Hail.

Battle hymns did sound the call.
You came to our side.
You heard true metal
Into glory ride.
Come on yea

You stood beside us,
The false ones cries.
Your love is judgment,
You gave us life.
You wait in the rain, you walk through the snow.
We give you our blood, we want you to know.

In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more.

We have read your letters, we have heard your call.
We were brought together 'cause we've got the balls
To play the loudest metal, so hard and wild and mean.
You'll live forever, we were born from your belief.

Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song

We want you to know

In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more

Metal makes us strong
Together we belong
Forever here's your song

We want you to know

In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever
In our eyes you're immortal
In our hearts you'll live forever more

Metal makes us strong
It makes us
Metal makes us strong
It makes us stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger...
Stronger, metal makes us strong

Let each note I now play
be a black arrow of death
sent straight to the hearts
of all those who play false metal

AH

Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my
soul.He calls my name,and waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame

Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in
Blood to pay.And the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if
I falter on my way.And what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the briges I now cross it giving
Him my soul

Dark Lord,I summon thee demanging the
Sucred right to burn in hell,ride up to hells
hot wind.Face one more evilthan thou,take
My lustful soul,
Drink my blood as I drink yours,impale me on
the horns of death
Cut off my head release all my evel Lucifer is king
Praise Satan

I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His name,is across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame.

He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told

Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly.
I made a rock-n-roll sin
When I tried giving in, to make money had to turn down loud
They said, "Why be proud, don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
Wear a polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get a haircut
And buy small gear"
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

I'm jet fuel honey, plug me in to 220, step back and let
My fingers fly
While I'm burning up my gear, there's a fire in your ear
That's won't stop until the day you die
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar
Oh, it's music to my ears when they scream
Then! Run back the power jack, and deck, all of my gear

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Well it's more to me than just a job, and while I'm playing
You won't get robbed
Nobody tells a man how to play, it just ain't that way
Hey, hey, hey, can you hear me say

All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten, never gonna turn down again

Hear the call of the wild in us all
It waits for the night to fall
I'm getting hot, I'm ready for the night
No holdin' back, let's ball
I'm gonna give all you can take all night
And leave you in the morning feeling right

I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free

I've been looking, you've been watching the side
There's somethings you just can't hide
Oh, your getting wet, your working up a sweat
Your hairs standing up on end
Your skin is screaming, glad we met?
Tonight's one night you won't forget

I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free

Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
His chariot pounding, I heard the heavens scream his name

I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He held up his hammer high and called Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end

God of thunder, God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse

I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
He held up his hammer high and called Odin for a sign

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end

Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and gods on high
And leave this mortal world

Thor the mighty, Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods, monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin

So tall, silent against the sky
Up through the clouds, where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change, what stood so long

Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

I'm in the ground, I'm in the air, I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator, in those who dare
And the day will come, when we all must die
And enter the mountainside

Tall as a mountain, I'm gonna tear through the sky
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you, it's all inside
Just climb

The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, see the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

Pounding, pounding, we are back from the dead
Those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

The spell has been broken, the curse has been lifted
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Four sworn to vengeance, see the hate in our eyes
Called by the gods and given a sign

Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer, be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Old man and young boys, it's my time
Sign of the hammer, it's my time

Burning embers of the second death will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega, poison bites
False prophets and deceivers, swing from the trees
Now dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood, like lepers with disease

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

They'll find no sanctuary hidden in their ancestral halls
Let loose the knot that binds
The spirit and flesh, let it fall
For only courage and heroism linger after death
So, hold fast thy sword, rejecting pain, feel the dragons breath

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

Burning embers of the second death will come in the night
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega, poison bites
False prophets and deceivers, swing from the trees
Now dawn the age of birds
Drunk with blood, like lepers with disease

Lord of the sky, mercury the guide
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred rite
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe
Hear my war cry

I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath
I've sworn the oath

Thank you for the kool aid reverend jim
We're glad to leave behind their world of sin
Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground
Rotting flesh a sacrificial mound

Were you our God or a man in a play who took our applause and forced us to stay
Now all together we lived as we dead on your command by your side

Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand

In the cult of the damned we all worked the land, too afraid to look up
We all feared his hand
Hurry my children
There isn't much time
But we'll meet again on the other side
Be good to the children and old people
First hand them a drink
They're dying of thirst

Guyana – in the cult of the damned

Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned

Bigfoot, bigfoot thrown in a well
Pulled under water
Screaming like hell
He told us life was just a hotel
Time to check out when he rang the bell

Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Guyana – in the cult of the damned
Give us your word for the grand final stand
Mother, mother.

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Darkness all around us
We don't close our eyes
No one's gonna ground us
We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Yea, be my brother

Come get us now we're waiting
We won't ride and hide

Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Now we're all together
Let's sing a fighting song
One hundred thousand riders

Comin' at us no stopping
Always Carry On

Carry On for when the day is long
Forever Carry On
For as long as we together
Then forever Carry On

Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me

Are you ready ?

Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man

Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed

Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win, crumbs or me

Are you ready ?

My brother's still in Da-Nang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win

Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays

Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed

When you are old enough to read these words
Their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left
And though we've never met, my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did my so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end

Defender

Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent

Father,father,father
I look up to you and heed thy call

This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written, it shall be

Defender

Ride like the wind
Fight proud, my son
You're the defender
God has sent

I have seen the fire
Of the thousands suns pass by
While blasphemers spread their Gospel
Bearing false witness
Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere

Holy, Holy War

Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Holy War
Baptized in Fire and Steel
Holy War
For the end we bring is soon
Holy War
Now face the storm
A Holy War

Brothers of metal know no masters
Metal's our religion
Take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth
Our dawn of glory
All reborn we live again
Hold true, ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep this dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground, our holy land

Holy, Holy War

Holy
We are fighting, fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom

Baptized in Fire and Steel

Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman.
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly.
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world.
I can see in darkness,
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear.
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

I am an outcast
On the path of no return.
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn.
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides.
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side.

Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind, Fire and Steel

Black Wind, Fire and Steel.

Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes, my machines's triple-plated chrome

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, faster, faster, faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road

Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel

Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride

Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We like it hard, we like it fast
We got the biggest amps, man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill

We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up, have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down

They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
other bands play Manowar kill

Build a fire a thousand miles away to light my long way home
I ride a comet
My trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone...
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel

Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold

Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
born with a heart of steel

From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come

Feel the white light
The light within
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come

Kingdom Come

Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come

Kingdom Come

Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall

Kingdom Come

Brothers I am calling from the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead, together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high

Blood and death are waiting like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation, punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill
Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill

Hail, Hail, Hail, Hail and Kill, Hail and Kill

- Grandfather, tell me a story !
- Alright, go and get your storybook
- No, no, not one of those, a real story !
- A real story ?
- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
- Well, then I shall have to take you back
with me, a long way in time...

It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day, as I walked through the enchanted forest,
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds, and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill. Before me, (there?)
was a great plain. Upon it, the armies of the
world, standing, waiting. I thought to myself,
for whom or for what are they waiting ?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north.
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword
of steel. Then from the south came another,
bearing a battle ax. From the east came a third,
holding a spiked club. And finally, from the west,
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war.
With them came their soldiers of death, followed
by an army of immortals. They were few in number,
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
victory or death. And there was a great silence...

My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness, rain came, and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree. I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air. Without warning, screaming
their war cry. They led the attack, down to
the battle they rode. They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash ! I could feel
the ground shake, the earth drank much blood
that day ! Each of the four, was unto himself,
a whirlwind of doom !!!!!!!!!!
When the smoke did clear, many thousands
were dead. There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield, like brown leaves blown by
the wind. And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill, while below them the
soldiers of death assembled, all those who
would now swear allegiance to them. And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer...

Gods of war I call You. My sword is by my side.
I seek a life of honor, free from all false pride.
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail.
Cover me with death if I should ever fail.

Glory, Majesty, Unity
Hail, Hail, Hail

And as I stood and looked on, I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end, and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land !

- Well that's it. Did you like the story ?
- Yeah, it was great !
- Oh Good, I'm glad. Now off to bed with you.
- Grandfather ?
- Yes ?
- Who were those four men ?
- Who were they ? They were the Metal Kings !!!!!!

Brothers the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the Battle Hymns
Into Glory Ride
Hail to England
The sign of the hammer's our guide
Forever we're Fighting the World
Side by side

Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France
Will not fail
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy
Switzerland, Austria
Back to the Glory of Germany

On a crusade
The world we bring

Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string

'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king

Sound the Death Tone
On our March for Revenge
Spill the Blood of my Enemies
The Oath of a Friend
Fight the Holy War for The Crown and the Ring
Six magic circles made by the Blood of the Kings

Wherever we ride it's metal we bring
Four Kings of Metal
Four Metal Kings
Death to the false ones
Dance on a string
'Til the blood on your sword is the blood of a king
'Til the blood on your hand is the blood of a king
Blood of a king.

She Is Waiting To Kiss My Hand

I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword

Oh friend of mine, how to say goodbye
This was your time, but the armor you wore
Was mine, I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky

Here is inside the walls Troy, the gods weigh my fate
From this day do I abstain, to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill,
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly.
Into the wind, where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend

Cowards in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt,
My hand a ruthless fate
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate
A bloodbath was born to bring, by birth I'm an assassin
To cut the cord of life and beath,
Ties to earth unfasten
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Kill...
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds,
The gods who once protected him are now his gods of doom,
Like a tower standing tall, steadfest in direction
I fall upon you bringing death, the gods give no protection
Coward in the grip of fear, no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth, with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me, as they fall ino their knees
Zeus the Thunderer, control my destiny
Blood and fire death and hate, you body I will desecrate
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits
Die, die, die...

The oath of the gods, this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle, Hector was killed
See him Patroclus, down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen, sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body until your body is burned
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed.

Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall
There's magic in the metal there's magic is us all

Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers go on get out
Leave the hall

Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend

Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers I said
Leave the hall

Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend

If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can
Leave the hall

Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall
Heavy metal or no metal at all wimps and posers leave the hall

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings
Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground

Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!

Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone
Into the fire with your soul!

Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings Racing to the battle in the sky
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die

Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air
I am invisible, I move without a sound
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground

Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm
We must die to be reborn

The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
The white men came to trade & borrow but then they would not leave
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery

We welcomed them as brothers knowing nothing of their greed
Born hunters not the hunted as the white man hunts for me
We are descendants of the animals we live among the free
Our trail of tears would end one day at Wounded Knee.

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

When we do the Ghost Dance, the buffalo will return
Paint ourselves for war, now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

Red Cloud, Black Hawk, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, Geronimo
Strong and brave warriors to the grave

There has been much killing there will be much more
The Medicine Man is dancing he's calling us to war,
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die

Great Spirit, thunder birds fly, we are wild and free
To fight and die by the open sky, Spirit Horse ride for me

We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation, now the black gods align
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.

Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.

Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand
glory and a broken sword.

I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield.

Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
From the north to the south in the black of night

Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled !

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword

There is blood in my hands there is blood in my eyes
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain

Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle
I laugh at my fate
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled !

The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering

Black candles slowly burning, white fangs and flashing eyes
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire,
As the seven steps await, hear the great bell toll
With a dead man's bones conjure, the enemy of the soul

From the misery and sadness, of the molten seas of hell
Mystic love and mystic symbols in evil dreams there dwell
Darkest forces and your demon's black order, black king
The cult that serves the living, accept this offering

A deadly drink, a meal of hearts, now sacrifice and die
In darkness and destruction, behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip

Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve

In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves born on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin

Night winds, Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth, appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip

Armies of the gods of hell ride across the astral plane
Bearing curses of destruction, sworn beyond the grave
Children of the darkness, all born but to deceive
By the ancient code of evil grant not one reprieve

In the place where evil dwells death can live when all life dies
Wage eternal war on heaven immortal hate below the sky
Your scripture and your sermons, are leaves borne on the wind
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Feel the Demon's whip

In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind, hear the angels sing

Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
We'll carry all our dreams in a single beam of light

Close your eyes, look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above, clouds below
High ascend the dreams within

When the wind fills the sky the clouds will move aside
And there will be the road to all our dreams
For any day that stings two better days it brings

Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes, look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring

Fly away to a rainbow in the sky gold is at the end for each of us to find
There the road begins where another one will end
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend
All to be the master of the wind

Now the time has come when all is said and done
We're back together on the road it's time to fly
No more time to wait you know it feels so great
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride
I ain't waiting to get old I'm runnin hot I'm never cold
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care
I got my wheels I got my friends we're on the road again
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die

Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

Losers try to put us down it's just another day
I got no money or big house just got life
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend
If you like metal you're my friend
And that bike out in the yard well that's my wife
Don't try to understand me my family never will
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
Either way it's my decision one more beer and heavy metal
And I'm just fine

Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

We are the undefeated we're not living in the past
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Feel the power of the wheel lets drink to riding steel
Livin hard and ridin fast

Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddam lifes
We'll do just what we feel riding horses made of steel
We're here to burn up the night

Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? No
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun

We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kindgdoms one

Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall

Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son

Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall

Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air

In the beginning there was silence and darkness
All across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky

From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
It's more than our religion it's the only way to live
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive

Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

We believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight

We're here tonight for heavy metal are you ready in the hall
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound

Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all

Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight

The gods made heavy metal and they saw that is was good
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
When losers say it's over with you know that it's a lie
The gods made heavy metal and it's never gonna die

Some want to think hope is lost see me stand alone
I can't do what others may want then I'll have no home

So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
So for now wave good-bye and leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night

And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Hear this song of courage ride into the night

Battles are fought by those with the courage to believe
They are won by those who find the heart
Find a heart to share
This heart that fills the soul will point the way to victory
If there's a fight then I'll be there, I'll be there

So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage long into the night
And the wind will bear my cry to all who hope to fly
Lift your wings up high my friend fearless to the end
So for now wave good-bye, leave your hands held high
Hear this song of courage ride into the night

We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
Turning hours into days burning muscles feel the pain
The heart and soul of discipline my friends

We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested, tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest

The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay

Let the game begin hear the starting gun
Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1

Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

The time has come all the training done
The muscle and the blood will come to pay

Play from the heart today we will overcome
When the game is over all the counting's done
We were born to win number 1

Today is the day all the training through
We have come for the number one not the number two
Let the contest begin play hard fight to win
Immortality victory and fame

We were born to win number 1

I'm a stranger in town and my guns never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride

The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill

The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill

Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride

Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
The will to go on and fight through endless suffering
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
The power of the man who would be king

Into the fight of hopes and dreams
The master of the wind knows nothing's what is seems
The melting of the soul the wish of those who scheme
The taking of the will by destroyers of the dream
They live to spread the fear of the wrong of right of self
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
But we know we have the power to fight and make a stand
Strike when we are challenged all across the land to be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
The heart's a righteous wind that comes to fill the sail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
By the power of the will, the spirit to survive to be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

All of the dreams held deep inside have a meaning to the soul
Freedom to bring a thought to the wing is waiting to unfold
For the crown and the ring
The power of the man who would be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive - Fight
By the power of the will the spirit to survive - Fight
Across the gates of Heaven beyond the gates of Hell - Fight
We fought to stay together
We have won and have lived to tell who would be king

Fight for the crown, fight for the ring
We're fighting the world, we fight for the king

I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire, fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
The power in the darkness to see without my sight
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Not to serve in Heaven but one day to rule in Hell

Power the power the power

This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan

Power the power the power

None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Secrets of all life and death are carried there within
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Have dominion of the earth be lord of all the night
Kill all those who stand against you look into their eyes
Drink their blood and laugh as they pay for all their lies
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell

Power the power the power

When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait, now we are home

Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait, now we are home

Now we will fight for the kingdom, fighting with steel
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Ride through their blood that we gladly have shed

I now issue the call, are you ready to fight - yeah
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again - tonight we will win

I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal, to fight and to die
Defenders of steel, now we are home

Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel

[Repeat 3, 4, 5, chorus to fade]

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts
And one day hope to be free

To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free

[Chorus:]
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there
If you want to - come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again

Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea ??
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years

[Repeat chorus]

Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song

[Repeat chorus to fade]

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride

The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign, raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine

Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven, not for hell

[Bridge:]
We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky

[Chorus:]
I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light

Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die

[Repeat bridge, chorus]

Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die

Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land

Oh I wish I was in Dixie away, away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie

Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixie land

Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on

So hush little baby, don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over

Glory, glory, hallelujah
This truth is marching on
This truth is marching on

Here our soldiers stand from all around the world
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here, victory is near
The sound will fill the hall, bringing power to us all

We alone are fighting for metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight, we're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel will never dry
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky

[Chorus:]
Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky - sworn to fight and die
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Many stand against us, but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again
To bring them all destruction, suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods, we are thunder, wind and rain.

There they wait in fear with swords in feeble hands
With dreams to be a king, first one should be a man
I call about and charge them all with a life that is a lie
And in their final hour they shall confess before they die

[Repeat chorus]

If I should fall in battle, my brothers who fight by my side
Gather my horse and weapons, tell my family how I died
Until then I will be strong, I will fight for all that is real
All who stand in my way will die by steel

Brothers everywhere - raise your hands into the air
We're warriors, warriors of the world

Hands of doom are reaching out to crush all infidels who stray
Time to know the pain, no time to run within
And these hands you see before you will end the light of day
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Your blood's upon the soil, your body fed to wolves
Not one of you will be left alive
Hear the sound pounding and the army of the night
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die

[Chorus:]
Tonight we strike, there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight, some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand

High atop the mountain, with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
In a flash of lightning strike now the house of death invites you
Body and soul to come within
I see the fear you have inside, you can run but never hide
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain, not your memory, your name
It will be as though you never, ever lived

Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set, I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill, never to forget

[Chorus:]
No road back, I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die, die, die into the house of death
And die, die, die into the fire of hell

Army of the heavens, my army waits in hell
To battle on the earth, for all the souls who fell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home
Across the bridge of death, beyond the gates of light
Into the heart of darkness, into the black of night

[Repeat chorus]

Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent, never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die

Die, die, die into the house of death
Die, die, die into the fire of hell

When they come, I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align

Thor, god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands, swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
We'll fight till we win or we'll fight until we die

Gods of thunder, fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die

Voices of Victory
All Shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Raise of the will our prophecy filled

I'm the lord of the day and the night
I've nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late

[Chorus:]
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They Pray I will never appear
The Life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear

I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

[Chorus:]
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings

All the days of his live
He walked without fear
All who's lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
So true is justice and retribution were unfailing

As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings..

I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

[Chorus x3]

King of kings!!!
King of kings!!!

King of...

Of Kings!

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

He is descended from giants. His father Loki,
God of fire, is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself. He rides across land, sea and air
From the land of the living, to the land of
The dead. This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass, from eight directions
Into eight dimensions. He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla!

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day

One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led

Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of across the sky
To the world of gods and men

Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high

Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded

Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me

The son of giants
Walks across the sky
To the gods a friend
Fathered beast and men

As a falcon he did fly
Far across the sky
To take back the hammer
Of Thor his friend

He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men

He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he

To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky

He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men

He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

Brother to Thor
And Odin god of war
Loki god of fire
Reigns for evermore

The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he

To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
God of fire

Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky

When the world turns you away
A friend will not say no
There is strength that we all have
It's not the strength we show

And in your darkest hour
In your darkest nights
Whatever life will do
I am here for you

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend

Though we're far away
The stars above are the same
And when you feel alone
There's one who shares your pain

A true friend has no price
There is none to pay
I remember you stood by me
I'm with you all the way

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend

Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me, know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend

Upon his shoulders perch two ravens, Hugin and Munin.
They circle the earth by day seeing all, at night they report to him the world's tidings.
He wears a golden helmet and a golden ring, at his side sit two wolves.
His weapons a magic sword and a spear called Gungnir, they are carved with runes.
His eight legged horse Sleipnir carries him over land, sea and air, the bringer of the valiant dead, the einherjar, from the battlefield across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla.

For a single drink of the enchanted water he paid with one eye, he was granted supreme wisdom.
He is the god of poetry, sorcery, and death.
Wounded, pierced by a spear he hung upside down for nine days.
Fasting and agony he made of himself a sacrifice to himself.
Given no bread nor mead he looked down, and with a loud cry fell screaming from the world tree.
In a flash of insight the secret magic of the runes was revealed to him.
He took up the runes and mastered them, eighteen powerful charms for protection, success in battle, lovemaking, healing and the power to bring back the dead.

His sacred blood mixed with black wind and rain wept down from the world tree deep into the earth.
He commanded the earth to crack open and to spew forth the strongest of the strong!

On this day he did bestow unto the world the sons of Odin!

Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night
I pounder
The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash

Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end

One day too
I may fall
I will enter Odin's Hall
I will die sword in hand
My name and my deeds will
Scorch the land

Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Soul full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

Sons of the gods today we shall die
Open Valhalla's door
Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
Hail Gods of War

[Solo]

Sons of Odin we for
By the hammer of Thor
Ride down from the sky
Another is born
Another shall fall
This day bent will die

(oh) Glory and fame
(oh) Blood is our name
(oh) Souls full of thunder
(oh) Hearts of steel
(oh) Killers of men
(oh) Of warriors friend
(oh) Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers

(oh) Hail Gods of War

(oh) Let the battle begin with swords in the wind
(oh) Hail
(oh) Gods
(oh) of War!!!

[Onward into the heart of battle
Fought the sons of Odin
Outnumbered many times
Still - they fought on
Blood poured forth from their wounds
Deep into the earth
Vultures waited for the broken shells
That once were bodies
Thus Odin alone would choose the day
They would enter Valhalla
And in their hour of need
He sent forth onto them The Berserker Rage
Now gods embed
They rose up from the ground
Screaming like wild animals
Such is the gift of absolute power
No blade or weapon would hurt them
They killed them and horses alike
And all who stood before them died that day
Hail Gods Of War]

Deep into the heart of the battle they fought. Covered on
All sides as all converged on them, until the four could
No longer be seen. As time passed I feared them lost, then
Slowly the armies separated, many were dead. I saw the four
Each down on one knee, all stopped to watch and gaze
Upon them with a smile of victory before sending them into
The ground.

Then they rose together to make a final stand. With their
Last bit of strength they raised their arms into the air pointing
Blood stained weapons to the sky. They called upon the god
Of war and made ready to die. But Odin would not call
Them this day to Valhalla, instead he sent thunder and
Lightning to strike the ground, bestowing upon them the
One gift every warrior lives in hope of - the berserker rage!

Now filled with that strength, the power of a thousand
Men was given them. No longer mortal they were touched
By the gods. This time when they took up the attack, men fell
Not by tens, but by hundreds, by thousands. And when the
Smoke did clear, the four spoke the words and the masses
Answered the response of the warrior's prayer.

Gods of war I call you
My sword is by my side
I seek a life of honor
Free from all false pride

I will crack the whip
With a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death
If I should ever fail

Glory, majesty, unity
Hail! Hail! Hail!

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war

Odin here the fallen wait
To join thee by thy side
Let Valhalla's gates open wide
Born under the sign
Of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal
We are gods of war

Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me

I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic, of life and death

Ah.. Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself

Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery, death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone

Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home

I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side

Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died

For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side

Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die!

A hero was he
Touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment

Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died
A man of honor

He paid with his life
For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal

Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand rest thy command
For Odin's call was heard above them all
Thy name shall never die!

Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge
Death's no stranger

Blood and death lived on his sword
The god of war his only lord
Into the depths of hell
Go all he fell

Take thy shield take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them when Odin bid thee rise

For none but the brave
Shall rise up from the grave
To see the Valkyries fly

And so it was by the hand of Odin
Did the immortal warrior pass through
The gates of Valhalla and into legend.

Rise brother rise pass Valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await

Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed

From the earth to the sky
Now the son of Odin rise!

Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die!

They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die!

Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly

So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer

He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there

They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you

They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell

They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!

Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching; they're marching on
Me and you

Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere

Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell

They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die!

I'LL SNAP YOUR FUCKING HEAD CLEAN OFF

THIS AIN'T NO CARAMEL
YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE MOTHERFUCKING HELL

Sightless sentinel of the sprawling void
Uncoiling black reflections
So slow the tides of the abyss
Megaliths of the unfathomable geometry loom high
Formless towers in the unreverberate darkness

Gaping fissures in the landscape yawn around me
Stones crumble to dust and fall to the depths
Nothing is familiar here, but always the same as before
The shell crumbles around me into the soil and sand
I am envenomed by the salt of the earth
Nothing is comfortable here, but always the same as before
Fragments of a brittle carapace
Fingernails, hair, and ash-buried bones

Sub-aural waves of the thunderous vibration
Tremor throughout the audient void
Infinite black integuements slither slowly
The titanic inertia of vast, sprawling planes
Always devouring, a timeless procession of infinite motion

A drop of rain into the churning sea
Dissolution into the yawning tides
I will forget what it is to be
And not knowing, I will rise again only to fall
I am the inheritor of disease
Of damp, black earth
My withered husk will dry upon the shore
I will become the sand
In forgotten dreams I crawl towards distant stars

And out of the great beyond came a pitch-black multitude,
Here to choose the weakest of our race:
Hellhounds with the devil's own face
Confused a violent strike for something finally here to guide the way,
Our faith in order was a mistake.
So fearful and divine and devoid of grace,
They try to run but there's no escape.
And the light decayed on that final day,
Fear crept up inside
Night became something more than a trade,
And our slumber, a weakness that we all can share.
Death calling in the wind: "This is the end."

I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky,
It was like a call from the other side.

What will you do now?
The fires of hell are raining down.
Deep inside you're starting to shake
And slowly losing ground.
Everyone is dead.  Your bravery is useless.
Your bravery is useless.

I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky,
It was like a call from the other side,
And there I cried, out of control and paralyzed,
As everything I once was died.

There's no way I'd be dying honorably,
If they came and took my life now.
There's no way I'd be dying honorably.

Regrets in tow, they didn't even stand a chance,
So hear me, final lines have been drawn:
To build again, to fall again.
It's warn me down to the last straw.
It took me down, took me until I don't feel human at all.
Test me now, test me.
I don't feel human at all.

So don't you go thinking that you found strength without a trial or two.
These days have got me feeling like a god.
Hear me, final lines have been drawn:
To build again, to fall again.
It's warn me down to the last straw.

And I held on so long to my home,
Until a tempest came
She came in and swept it away.
[repeat]

Where's your bravery?
What will bravery do for you now?

You make your way but don't belong
I swear you're not the only one.
Is that what you've been dreaming?
Is that what you've been dreaming?

There's other ways of staying strong,
Than keeping out the other ones.
I feel the light years in between
What you say and what you mean.
You won't get through with that phony confidence,
I hear you speak
But nothing is said.
You'll be stranded on the other side,
Endless nights upon endless nights.
Endless nights upon endless nights.
You'll be alone,
Alone to the grave.

There's a place in all of us, same in everyone,
Making right the balances in all of us.
Aching and burning and growing and learning,
And building the world around us.
Until our lives are done, we'll share the same emotions,
Shed tears of eulogy, then turn to plant the seeds
Still you can't hear me

Call out your name and try to get through,
I never hear back, never hear back

My words became a thousand arrows,
Slicing through the endless barricades,
So that everyone on earth could hear my call,
And I watched for you.

You're putting me on,
You've chosen to swear off the general population.

All those around you draw to a quiet
Your eyes dart across the room
But it's just an illusion
The room doesn't exist- it's only you and I.
And it's almost like we can't fail at all,
Or maybe we've failed already,
What you choose to see is real:
A cold dark world of enemies,
Obstacles you can never overcome,
Or a bright future ahead.

So tell the whole world and we'll start brand new.
Strip the shackles off, let me look at you.
If you can't reach out like you've been longing to,
I'll have to rethink all that I thought I knew.

Call out your name and try to get through,
I never hear back, never hear back
From you.
[repeat]

Tap the primal circuit,
The current lets you know you're alive.
Make this crushing power ceaseless,
You could capture the world.
When embracing the electric kingdom,
Know that it could all come crashing down.
With unseen surges coming closer,
I fight to defend my denied throne.

I took selected analysis.
That day I never felt more addicted.
Barely surviving the shock,
Soon I found myself in a cruel revolving door.
You said failure, I said you're turning to

Cruel sources,
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources,
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from cruel sources.

Change up the trend for the hell of it,
Then you'll see I never did support it.
Carving away at the block
I became the light I'd so long been searching for.
You said savior, I said you're turning to

An electric current fuels the lust again.
Like a feral god
I've stepped far outside the lines
But I feel no shame.
I stole the scales and I cleared my name.
Now try,
Try to pry them from my dead hands.
Now try,
Try to pry them from my dead hands.

Cruel sources,
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources,
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from you.

Slaving for my solace of mind
Digging in the sand until there's blood on my hands,
Careless to the state I'm in,
I've so long been alone,
I've so long been alone.
I can't go on.

Rain down, rain down
Cleanse my soul, flow like a river.

Forging insight by pagan torchlight,
In cadence warlike,
We draw tears from the sky
Because the well's run dry.

Rain down, rain down
Cleanse my soul, flow like a river.

I've spread out my seed,
It's gone in all directions.
It starts to feel like
The promiseland is a fantasy
And heaven has been swallowed by the desert.

In a draught without submission,
Not a cloud in the sky,
This course keeps getting harder,
The more I try.
I dig up dry bones
And the corpses cry as they open their eyes
To see the world's decay.
This world's a tomb,
There's a clamor in my heart and it's over
Where is my prize?
It's over
Where is my prize?
My promised prize.

Forging insight by pagan torchlight,
In cadence warlike,
We draw tears from the sky

Rain down, rain down
Cleanse my soul, flow like a river.

Look at me now
I'm losing control
I don't know what to call myself.
I know that I'm sick of playing a role
All along I've been kidding myself,
Seeking out a set reality.

They say sanity is dictated by what the larger percentage of society sees.
What does that mean?
Clearly nothing! Clearly nothing!
Psychology is not an exact science.  In fact, there is no exact science,
Though it may seem.
That means I'm OK and everything's OK.

All along,
I've been kidding myself
Life is falling apart at the seams.

Somehow I'm doomed to go over the same ground in these compulsive circular
thought patterns.
Over and over time and again
Over and over time and again.
I think I've got it all worked out
Then I forget every conclusion drawn,
Every epiphany gone.

I felt safe,
Then the walls come crashing
in one day
Without warning,
Everything that I thought was stable
Deep in me starts to wash away.

Can you feel it?
It's the motion of the tide.
Watch yourself now,
There's an ocean deep inside.
You could drown in it.

Look at me now
I'm losing control
Might even be learning to enjoy the sting of the irony.
Changing my shape, I slide through the doorway.

Can you feel it?
It's the motion of the tide.
Watch yourself now,
There's an ocean deep inside.
You could drown in it.
Watch yourself now,
There is no ocean deeper than this.
Watch yourself,
It's an endless journey through the abyss.

All along I've been kidding myself,
Working equations.
It's a long walk in and there's no clear way home.
Everything I was in constant change.
I'm not the same.
I'm not the same.

To hit the mark,
To bring the rain,
To take a climb,
The path to fame.

I sat dreaming a lone,
Then it came out of nowhere.
An all too familiar voice with a false face:
The voice of the jealous.
It's less than encouraging.
Walls have been closing in.
Though in droves the masses came.
Years from now they'll say:

From the way out, from the way out
Fools rushing over the hills,
There to watch him fall,
There to watch him fall.

And there amidst the sleepless night it came to me.
Endurance, endurance, it came to me
And now nothing can stop me or keep me in line.
Get out of the way as I take to the sky.

It's hard to discern all the motives I see.
One thing's for sure, when the crowds have dispersed and forgotten me
And forgotten their dreams,
I'll still be all that I am.
I am more than a clown for you
Hear me, and know it to be true.

From the way out, from the way out
Fools rushing over the hills,
There to watch him fall,
There to watch him fall.

Until you're ready to break
Until you're ready to bend
Critical condition, critical.

The years will wear down every brick you lay.
There's more to life than selling your days.
Money makes sense in the world today, they say.
I'm not living that way.

Setting off, setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own.
I won't be a product on the industry line,
You stand for nothing or you stand alone.

Leave it to us to cross the final line.
Can you feel the dawning of our time?
Take a moment to turn and see the signs.
Can you feel the dawning of our time?
Time to wake up and turn the light on,
Come on turn the light on.

Setting off, setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own.
I won't be a product on the industry line,
You stand for nothing or you stand alone.

Pitiful,
Doing what you're told.
In turn,
They granted you power.
In a condescending tone,
You stand on the watchtower,
Here in our last hour,
And say that you know.
Typical
Of those that will never see.
Say that you know.
Typical
Of those that will never be free.
Just like that,
Took our strongest years
In the name of greed.
Just like that
And made commercials out of our broken dreams.

As pitch black factory stacks turn all the world's beautiful colors to gray,
Empower the rights that they can't take away:
Raise your voices!

Echoes of the spirit,
Echoes of the spirit,
Resounding in tones that set you free.
Shout with me:
We are awake!

Setting off, setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own.
I won't be a product on the industry line,
You stand for nothing or you stand alone.

We're in critical condition, critical condition.
Figured it out because we've all been here before.

You've come to save the world?
What do you believe?
What do you believe?

So you've been chosen:
By your eyes,
By your hands,
By the choices that you call your own,
And price that you would sell your own soul.
Pay the toll.
Carry your,
Carry your last test of flesh and bone
We make exchanges as the story unfolds.

You've come to save the world?
What do you believe?
What do you believe?

Who are you?  What have you become?
A charming illusion, a source of confusion.
Another day you'll win the race.
A charming illusion, a source of confusion.

Who are you?  What have you become?
A charming illusion, a source of confusion.
Another day you'll find your place.
A charming illusion, a source of confusion.

Another rise to power,
No matter who or when,
And we will know of our freedom
Never again, never again.
A common thread of distance,
In the hearts of men,
And we'll have love for our brother,
Never again, never again.
We are all the victims of a will to overcome.

How far we've gone out of  touch.
There's no right side of war.
There's no right side of war.
Can't justify it,
There's no right side of war.
There's no right side of war.

To erase away
All that we've become.
They can't see we're all one.

A voice cries from underneath:
Dark shepherds strongly though you wield the staff.
You're weakened by comfort
There's no way you're prepared for what happens last:
Action
Reaction
Like an eye for an eye from our tribal days.
The lesser ones demand reaction.
Dare to challenge the one universal law,
Set you up to fall?
Do you understand now
Why your days are numbered?
Do you understand?

The course of events were a riddle,
A pause in time,
A search for the solution as we stood in line,
Honored our oppressors and paid our fines,
Then all became clear as the ferocity inside began,
To hear the drums of war resound across the land,
Announcing the fate to shed blood upon the earth,
It is ours.

Doomed to repeat our history,
There is more than one way to manifest the possibility of how things could be.
No time to question how, when, or why,
We simply come together or die.

To a system of capitalist politicians,
False face of a greater power:
Your empire will fall
Bringing about the end of an era.
Warmongers,
Your bloodlust to conquer
Turns the moments of our lives
Into a ticking timebomb of your own creation,
Counting down the days,
Rot in your graves.

How far we've gone out of touch.
There's no right side of war.
There's no right side of war.
Can't justify it,
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war.

To erase away
All that we've become.
To erase away
All that we love.
There's no right side of war.

Now that we've reached the end,
And I'm the only one surviving,
I'm just waiting for the morning light,
To touch my skin,
Warm my heart,
But I see a dead world at sunrise.
A dead world at sunrise,
And nothing can reverse the state.
Who now will pray
And save my soul
When hell ascends?
And calls my name?
I'm alone,
And so forth and so on.
Their faces left,
I'm longing for death,
I'm in torture.
Torture,
It's all that's left of my memories.
The cold hard truth,
Bitter and sweet,
Though I can't touch them, see them,
They are there, silent.
They listen,
Silent though, they listen.
But I see a dead world at sunrise.
A dead world at sunrise,
And nothing can reverse the state.
We are still one,
and I'm missing pieces of myself,
Of myself, of myself...
And out of the great beyond came a pitch-black multitude,
Here to choose the weakest of our race:
Hellhounds with the devil's own face
Confused a violent strike for something finally here to guide the way,
Our faith in order was a mistake.
So fearful and divine and devoid of grace,
They try to run but there's no escape.
And the light decayed on that final day,
Fear crept up inside
Night became something more than a trade,
And our slumber, a weakness that we all can share.
Death calling in the wind: "This is the end."

I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky,
It was like a call from the other side.

What will you do now?
The fires of hell are raining down.
Deep inside you're starting to shake
And slowly losing ground.
Everyone is dead.  Your bravery is useless.
Your bravery is useless.

I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky,
It was like a call from the other side,
And there I cried, out of control and paralyzed,
As everything I once was died.

There's no way I'd be dying honorably,
If they came and took my life now.
There's no way I'd be dying honorably.

Regrets in tow, they didn't even stand a chance,
So hear me, final lines have been drawn:
To build again, to fall again.
It's warn me down to the last straw.
It took me down, took me until I don't feel human at all.
Test me now, test me.
I don't feel human at all.

So don't you go thinking that you found strength without a trial or two.
These days have got me feeling like a god.
Hear me, final lines have been drawn:
To build again, to fall again.
It's warn me down to the last straw.

And I held on so long to my home,
Until a tempest came
She came in and swept it away.
[repeat]

Where's your bravery?
What will bravery do for you now?

You make your way but don't belong
I swear you're not the only one.
Is that what you've been dreaming?
Is that what you've been dreaming?

There's other ways of staying strong,
Than keeping out the other ones.
I feel the light years in between
What you say and what you mean.
You won't get through with that phony confidence,
I hear you speak
But nothing is said.
You'll be stranded on the other side,
Endless nights upon endless nights.
Endless nights upon endless nights.
You'll be alone,
Alone to the grave.

There's a place in all of us, same in everyone,
Making right the balances in all of us.
Aching and burning and growing and learning,
And building the world around us.
Until our lives are done, we'll share the same emotions,
Shed tears of eulogy, then turn to plant the seeds
Still you can't hear me

Call out your name and try to get through,
I never hear back, never hear back

My words became a thousand arrows,
Slicing through the endless barricades,
So that everyone on earth could hear my call,
And I watched for you.

You're putting me on,
You've chosen to swear off the general population.

All those around you draw to a quiet
Your eyes dart across the room
But it's just an illusion
The room doesn't exist- it's only you and I.
And it's almost like we can't fail at all,
Or maybe we've failed already,
What you choose to see is real:
A cold dark world of enemies,
Obstacles you can never overcome,
Or a bright future ahead.

So tell the whole world and we'll start brand new.
Strip the shackles off, let me look at you.
If you can't reach out like you've been longing to,
I'll have to rethink all that I thought I knew.

Call out your name and try to get through,
I never hear back, never hear back
From you.
[repeat]

Tap the primal circuit,
The current lets you know you're alive.
Make this crushing power ceaseless,
You could capture the world.
When embracing the electric kingdom,
Know that it could all come crashing down.
With unseen surges coming closer,
I fight to defend my denied throne.

I took selected analysis.
That day I never felt more addicted.
Barely surviving the shock,
Soon I found myself in a cruel revolving door.
You said failure, I said you're turning to

Cruel sources,
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources,
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from cruel sources.

Change up the trend for the hell of it,
Then you'll see I never did support it.
Carving away at the block
I became the light I'd so long been searching for.
You said savior, I said you're turning to

An electric current fuels the lust again.
Like a feral god
I've stepped far outside the lines
But I feel no shame.
I stole the scales and I cleared my name.
Now try,
Try to pry them from my dead hands.
Now try,
Try to pry them from my dead hands.

Cruel sources,
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources,
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from you.

Slaving for my solace of mind
Digging in the sand until there's blood on my hands,
Careless to the state I'm in,
I've so long been alone,
I've so long been alone.
I can't go on.

Rain down, rain down
Cleanse my soul, flow like a river.

Forging insight by pagan torchlight,
In cadence warlike,
We draw tears from the sky
Because the well's run dry.

Rain down, rain down
Cleanse my soul, flow like a river.

I've spread out my seed,
It's gone in all directions.
It starts to feel like
The promiseland is a fantasy
And heaven has been swallowed by the desert.

In a draught without submission,
Not a cloud in the sky,
This course keeps getting harder,
The more I try.
I dig up dry bones
And the corpses cry as they open their eyes
To see the world's decay.
This world's a tomb,
There's a clamor in my heart and it's over
Where is my prize?
It's over
Where is my prize?
My promised prize.

and I'm missing pieces of myself,
Of myself, of myself...

The sun daubs shimmering baths for the field,
everything is waiting themselves to be healed,
grateful leaves of green gather outside their lairs,
fluids of gentle rain drops silently in pairs.

The paint is to be denied by the horizon,
circular zones of time re-arrange on,
precious daubing of the sun,
switch on for another one.

Daubing of the crescent travel far across,
light for the hollow despair of bitter loss,
the field is clothed by a thin cloak of grey,
the sun and horizon will start another day.

It's pale presence demands another harvest...

The paint is to be denied by the horizon,
circular zones of time re-arrange on,
precious daubing of the sun,
switch on for another one.

Which gracefully shows it's brilliance,
transparent grey glow in it's guidance,
crescent of a dying peasant,
for eyes of the radiant.

When at a morning my feet touches the cold earth,
or what mirrored it into our imagination deeper,
it meant dying
I'd rather feel the grass under me.

I'd rather have a twig cut a bleeding on a bare foot,
causing pain,
than touch of false moss, under me

When I stalk this flat earth
rather hills would I adore
when I see false homes
homes for no wanderer to be.

I'd more love the shelter of an old fir
by day, under her cooling shadow by night hidden
from the star's light.

When illumes the strange lights
competing with life's own.
Held 'em prison I tell you,
held 'em in illusions.

I'd rather talk with the sun
see the young birch brought to life
and by night, sleep under a free moon.

When the wind turns north
brings forth the cold
I see death fleeing to death
life left alone.

I'd rather smell true death
wash myself with burning leaves
and by night, sleep under

Dream my precious, with no fear
I'll sing my song to make you sleep
Dream about fairies, dream about elves
About secrets hidden behind your eyes

Child of Aprils Sun you are
I'll hold you to keep you warm all night
Snowflakes floating
I will show you how from the cold comes the light

I will be your guard, drive the freezing winds away
Preserve you from the cold, take you under my wing
Like endlessness above I will be awake
Through this winter night I will sing

The whole world and the deepest spaces
Waiting just for you to come
Someday you will go my dear
I'll give you my voice to walk with you

I will be your guard, drive the freezing winds away
Preserve you from the cold, take you under my wing
Like endlessness above I will be awake
Through this winter night I will sing

From the Emptiness comes life
So full it will be
You came from nowhere
Teached me more I never knew
And I cried with you 'cause I understood
That in the Beginning is always the End as well...

I will be your guard, drive the freezing winds away
Preserve you from the cold, take you under my wing

Repentance,
left behind I have those sour moments.

Saddled,
and my journey to home started.

From inner lands I left, and will never return,
the sea will be my home from now on.

Fears from you I learned,
as my journey went on.

You brought me the shimmering meadows,
and darkest stars at nights, I travelled.
You showed me bitter delights and those moments,
I enjoyed.

Scales to my back you brought and grills to my neck,
ocean waters you teached me to adore,
repent shall I not,you teched, and hastened my journey,
to forget, you showed me, is the key to my glory.

Furious Gods whom I have not known

Enemies who speak in tongues of fire
Purify us in black flames

Burn... oh god we burn!

We bow down in shame
And whisper powerless words
"Let not the ark of God of Israel be with us"
For his hand is hard on us
And on Dagon our god"

This blasphemy will be
Avenged upon us
Out blood will colour
The earth blood red
And it will be licked away
By the dog-gods
Darkness shall be upon us
For three horrible days

Pestilence and death
Creep over our land
Flocks of bugs will ruin our crops
Blistering flashes from the skies
Onslaught the enemies of Israel
We are the damned race
Cursed by the wrath of Yahweh
Our millennial resurrection
Shall be smothered in blood
We bow down in shame...

I turn my eyes to Ba'al
Our great god

Powerlessly staring at the horizon
In the Temple of Created Things
We feel no more glory
About the battle of Aphek
What sacrifice is needed for victory?

Those who speaks
In tongue of distemper
Purify us in black flames
The fire-spitting demon Azazel
Spreads his blackened wings
The earth is drenched
In the blood of Goliath
7 months of suffering

Lord Ba'al, creator of our fertile earth
Majestic father and king
Of gods and men
Master of the mountains
Ruler of the rainstorms
We bow down before thy splendour
Lord Ba'al-El, god of life and fertility
Intermit the continual combat
With the god Mot
Show the leech of Yahweh thy might
And slay the Hebrews
And their ravaging god

We bow down in shame
And whisper powerless words
"Let not the ark of God of Israel be with us"
For his hand is hard on us
And on Dagon our god"

Before thine erected sacred altars
We beg
We are smitten
With divine Obamanations
Unshackle us from death and sterility
And destroy the realm
Of the circumcised

This inhuman place makes inhuman monsters

Here at the court of the Red Tsar
The Devil plays chess with Beria
This inhuman place
Makes human monsters
Trains full of corpses, love
Death and hysteria

This place shall be called
A cult of torture
A secret sect of sacred executioners
My Datsja shall be called
A house of prayer
Dissidents struck
By the lightning of the Moscovite Zeus

Bloody pen strokes
Feed the desk of mass murderers
Death of millions plotted
Under warm candlelight
This inhuman place
Makes human monsters
Trains full of corpses, fear
Death and hysteria

This place shall be called
A cult of torture
A secret sect of sacred executioners
My Datsja shall be called
A house of prayer
Dissidents struck by the lightning
Of the Moscovite Zeus

Amoral ambition, efficient execution
Cold witch-hunting mania combed
Through from west to east
Dangerous perfection, a spiritual decay
Connoisseur of funerals
Will lead the Reich astray

Violent retribution
Criminal aggression
Counter charging Soviet hordes fought
Back from the east to west
Blood-drunk red avengers
Ferocious as a dog
This inhuman place
Makes inhuman monsters

Monsters!

Immured
I dreamt my memories
An empty hollowed spirit
Restless...
Stirring in this Kremlin wall
And while I lie here...
They defile... they desecrate my tomb!
They tried to blacken
Trivialise and slander
The holy name of Stalin
Dozing and slumbering in Limbo
I remember with joy those days when
My enemies fell upon me

This age knows nothing of war
To break Barbarossa
I put Mother Russia to-the-torch
It is June 1941
My enemies were legion
But the red death held sway over all
The noble name of Stalin
Caused the Krauts more fear
Than the deepest battle drums
Invincible and endless
Invincible and endless
Katyusha symphonies
Brought great terror and
Death upon the doomed invaders

The Kremlin Cardinal
Served the dark will
Of the soulless Red Emperor
Behold!!
The Fist of Stalin

Kolyma Means Death

I did what must be done
I did not hesitate - I showed no mercy
O quam mi'sericors est
Stalin justus et pius
The dawn of the new
Red Age is imminent
I reclaim the Soviet Throne

Rivers of blood, cathedrals of corpses
Kulak slaves perish
And die for the Red Monarch
The Grey Cardinal
Leaves his shadow world
The Maskirovka falls

Behold!!
Eternal Stalin

Hunger

Cringing at the sight, flawless face dragged
I giggled, kissing my fingers, type c and saliva bubbling
Kissing my fingers
Find an easier way of dying, before you get murdered.
Type c and saliva bubbling
Kissing my fingers
The floor boards will never hold the same finish

The soiled ground for the sacrifice
Dispelled. crippling. faulty. holyland.
I am your martyr, your stigmata
The tears turn to blood beneath my eyes.
My body listens... as you whisper
My fingers bend... as I'm nailed to your cross.
The splinters etch... hearts in my back
I denounce this crucifixion, I demand another sacrifice.
A cast shadow over this narrow hill
Pulling my fingers from these nails
There will be no use for a second coming

I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked up.
When we got there I told her to wait outside, pick wild flowers.
I went upstairs and stripped all of my clothes off.
I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them.
When all was ready I went to the window and called her.
Then I hid in the closet until she was in the room.
She saw me all naked and began to cry and tried to run downstairs.
I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama.
First I stripped her naked.
How she did kick bite and scratch.
I choked her to death.
Then I cut her into small pieces so I could take my meat to my room, cook
And eat it.
Sweet and tender her ass roasted in the oven
It took me nine days to eat her entire body.
I did not fuck her.
Though I could have as I wished.
She died a virgin.

Dragged to the burial where witches flew overhead.
Roses drip black and children weep in awe at their mother's side
And tissues break. shows your ample wit.
To get back at your bastards lust.
Razor proof veil and an odor less scarf bring the day to rust.
Blue dress at a black grave.
Razor proof veil and an odor less scarf bring the day to rust.

What you've accomplished towards me was sickening
So I'll be sure to return the favor.
You hurt me horribly, I turned back, you killed me.
I haven't for much, but I'll ask you this...
Why would you destroy your best friend...
I'm so tired of looking into mirrors, just to see the reflection cry.
So plain and simple, I need you to die.
As there piling away your worthless body
I'll be sure to shatter the tombstones that are laid
Theres nothing more I'd rather see
Than you chasing bullets as you fall into a tunnel
Then your heart goes comatose and your appendages torn off
Sending out the harmony that you're gone
You're gone
YOU'RE GONE!
Place this picture of my face in your lovers' hands,
Watch her dying in pain and disbelief.
Now you're gone, now you're gone...
YOU'RE GONE!!!
I feel that I've done my part,
But now it's time to stop this beating heart...
How could you destroy
Your best friend
But now it's time, for me, to stop... beating

From these bloody hills
Comes unmixed oil and water
Concentrated by abstract particles
Distilled through cross pollination

Pick up this doll and watch the girl dream.
Cups spill what holds, what holds, what holds tomorrow.
Clenching the fist, raising the brow.
As glass enters the vein.
Justice shines in her dark eyes.
As an amber sky drips a tear upon a sunset.
This is seraplis dream. ten crowns drop.
Parchment paper crumbles, when the curtain falls.
Shade this tribulation in pastels
Silk feelings hurt
The river holds the color you describe as love.

Do you remember, do you recall.
Oh, that moment we lost it all.
Everything, I'd die, if you choose not to fight.
On and on, the same old story.
Another night we fall from glory.
When will we ever learn.

Forever, and ever hear me calling you.
The echoes from the past, oh.
Wherever, whenever you should call my name.
I swear, I will be there, don't you know.

To cut the rope, I am still afraid.
'Cause I know, nothings left to say.
Because we ran, I can never return.
I lose my mind, inside I'm craving.
I turn to God, he laughs, he's saying.
When will you ever learn.

Forever, and ever hear me calling you.
The echoes from the past, oh.
Wherever, whenever you should call my name.
I swear, I will be there, don't you know.

Forever, and ever hear me calling you.
The echoes from the past, oh.
Wherever, whenever you should call my name.
I swear, I will be there, don't you know. (I will be there for you.)

Forever, and ever hear me calling you.
The echoes from the past, oh. (Yeah, the echoes from the past.)
Wherever, whenever you should call my name.
I swear, I will be there, don't you know

Come on baby 
Oh, no no no no no no. 
We crack it up, we hit the top.
We're moving through time.
We're thunderous, mysterious and glorious.
We're born to born to born to
To raise some hell.
We speed at night move out of sight.
We breake the chains.
Oh, yeah! 
Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
We are on the move.
And we will prove.
We're the strongest of them all.
Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
United we stand.
Raising our hands.
Nations fall.
Metal will stand tall. 
We crash and burn.
We hit and run.
We make a stand.
From the ash into the fire.
See a phoenix rise.
See a phoenix rise. 
Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
We are on the move.
And we will prove.
We're the strongest of them all.
Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
United we stand.
Raising our hands.
Nations fall.
Metal will stand tall. 
Yeah!
We stand tall!
Come on! 
Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
We are on the move.
And we will prove.
We're the strongest of them all. 
Made of steel we fly.
Like an eagle in sky.
United we stand.
Raising our hands.
Nations fall.
Metal will stand tall. 
Will stand tall, yeah!
Will stand tall!
Metal will stand tall!

My heart is screaming out your name

Night falls, my mind recalls the sound of your heart breathing
Thoughts of your thousand kisses burning on my skin

I feel your desire as the moonlight lingers in the sky
I'm walking trough fire, can't you hear me when I cry

[Refrain:]
One night of passion, one night of hunger
And my attraction is getting stronger
I need to feel you, I need to hold you
I can't deny 'cause my heart is screaming out your name

My heart is screaming out your name

Tonight I won't be alone, doesn't mean that I'm not lonely
One minute is like an hour until you calm my pain

I feel your desire as the moonlight lingers in the sky
I walking trough fire, can't you hear me when I cry

[Refrain]

My heart is screaming out your name

Every time you're not around
You're a thought within my mind
Hold me near, never fear
I'm right beside

[Refrain]

[Refrain]

If you can see me now.
If you can hear me now.

So long, I will see you again.
I don't know how, and I don't know when.
But I've seen this phase before.
(Ah) Who knows what we leave behind?
What we had is surely hard to resign.
You keep me, I be coming back for more.
You and me go back a long, long time.
I know you well enough to, read your mind.

If you can see me now.
I'm wasting my time, try to get by.
This is my song for you.
If you can hear me now.
I wait for a sign, to bring back the time.
This is my song for you.

It's been this way before.
You come and go, this time I'd had to know.
What goes on inside of you.
It's not so hard to see.
The consequences of the life that we leaved.
So tell me, what it means to you.
Sometimes it all come's shining through.
What I miss the most, is talk to you.

If you can see me now.
I'm wasting my time, try to get by.
This is my song for you.
If you can hear me now.
I wait for a sign, to bring back the time.
This is my song for you.

Sometimes you far away from me.
Away to reach, and I do believe.
You're tired of making plans that no one's attended to keep.

If you can see me now.
I'm wasting my time, try to get by.
This is my song for you (If you can see me now.)
If you can hear me now.
This is my song for you. (For you)

If you can see me now. (If you can see me now.)
This is my song for you.
If you can hear me now.
This is my song for you.
If you can see me now.
This is my song for you.
If you can hear me now.
This is my song for you.

Don't say it, because you must.
Destroy the beautiful, from love to dust.
A promise, like hearts of steel.
Can break so easily, when love's not real.
We don't make much sense without it.
Is this the end?

It's a new evasion.
A complication.
We need a simplification.
I need your love, just like the shadow needs the light.
Temptation.
A sudden transformation.
Is this a massive oration.
And I've become the sudden shadow in your life.

You're falling, away from me.
I'm right in front of you, still I can't reach.
We don't make much sense without it.
Is this the end?

It's a new evasion.
A complication.
We need a simplification.
I need your love, just like the shadow needs the light.
Temptation.
A sudden transformation.
Is this a massive oration.
And I've become the sudden shadow in your life.

It's a new evasion.

The Poodles

I, I don't wanna feel this pain, anymore.
And I, I don't wanna be your prisoner anymore.
Tell me, tell me you would die for me.
Oh, make me un---.
Save me from captivity.

I've been waiting, waiting for the day that never comes.
I'm still searching for a gleam of something to hold on.
Try, I really wanted you to try.
But, I'll compromise.

I want you to lie to me, so I can feel alive.
I want you to trust me, say the words I ---.
It's easy, when you lie to me.
Save me from reality.
I want you to lie, lie to me.

Let me, carry you far away.
From all of this darkness.
I wanna hear you speak my name.
You found the flames, burning inside of me.
You're responsible, for stripping me of all my pride and dignity.
We can't, woman.
You don't understand the scars, I'm hiding.
My heart is like a dagaty, beside your careless hand.
Try, I really wanted you to try.
But, I'll compromise.

I want you to lie to me, so I can feel alive.
I want you to trust me, say the words I ---.
It's easy, when you lie to me.
Save me from reality.
I want you to lie, lie to me, lie to me.
I'm absest.

I need to hide you ---.
Am I the hunter or am I the prier.
Stuck in you at night, and I know.
I'll end up being your sacrifice.

I want you to lie to me, so I can feel alive.
I want you to trust me, say the words I ---.
It's easy, when you lie to me.
Save me from reality.
I want you to lie, lie to me.

Tell me, tell me you would die for me.

The Poodles

Hiding in the wings
watching every move she makes
a champion in the ring

Then she starts to sing
chills and goosebumps neckhair standing

and she steps into the light, so possesive

Not a ordinary girl
Almost shining like a pearl
She's a rockstar

She's the ordinary girl
Like an outcast of this world
She's a rockstar

Hi it's me again
I'm the one how wrote you, signed:
"Your one true only fan"

You remember - I can tell
Heard that you've been missing me
just like a lost friend.
when I look into my eyes you posseses me

Not a ordinary girl
Almost shining like a pearl
She's a rockstar

We're the outcast of this world
Just like kindred me and her
She's my rockstar

Yes, I've been away
on vacation you might say
Didn't feel to good about myself
but your music make me stick it through

Not a ordinary girl
Almost shining like a pearl
She's a rockstar

We're the outcast of this world
Just like kindred me and her
She's my rockstar

Not a ordinary girl (She's not a ordinary girl)
oh ah She's shining like a pearl

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's five and i'm driving home again
It's hard to believe that it's my last time
The man on the wireless cries again
It's over, it's over

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's late and i'm with my love alone
We drink to forget the coming storm
We love to the sound of our favourite song
Over and over

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

It's time and we're in each other's arms
It's time but i don't think we really care

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh.

Stand on the outside, looking in.
Don't know where to turn, where to begin.
It's a long viney road.
I am on travel in a restless heart.

Where flying so high, touching the sky.
Spreading our wings again.
My heart is up high, with burning desire.
Always I will stand by your side.
Don't give up on love.

No, no.

Don't give up now, we have come so far.
Together we'll find out who we are.
And the road has been long.
I need a companion for my restless heart.

Where flying so high, touching the sky.
Spreading our wings again.
My heart is up high, with burning desire.
Always I will stand by your side.
Don't give up on love, love, love.
Don't you give up, don't you give up.
No.

Don't give up on love.
My heart is burning, my soul's on fire.
Don't give up on love.
So --- fire, my good desire.

Where flying so high, touching the sky.
Spreading our wings again.
My heart is up high, with burning desire.
Always I will stand by your side.
Where flying so high, touching the sky.
Spreading our wings again.
My heart is up high, with burning desire.
Always I will stand by your side.

Don't give up on love.
No, no.

Don't give up on love.
Oh.
Don't give up, don't give up.

I lose my religion
Then, am I a sinner
In the end?

Well it seems
Like every woman
Is the devils
Right hand

Whatch me now!!

Number one
Might be jumping the gun
Pictures only begun
Like I've alreday won
I'm second to none
I'm second to none

Slave
To your rythm
And the sent
I know so well

Have I
Found my Eden
Or am I done
The road to hell?

Watch me now!!

Number one
See me shine like the sun
Chewing confident gum
I ain't done 'til I'm done

You're second to...

Number one
Might be jumping the gun
Pictures only begun
Like I've alreday won
I'm second to none

What me now

Number one
See me shine like the sun
Chewing confident gum
I ain't done 'til I'm done

You're second to...

Number one
Might be jumping the gun
Pictures only begun

I'm second to none

Number one
Oh Oh Ah Ah
You're second

Many people living in the world they believe
They're caught in a trap and never do
what they please
Stand up
You know it's all a lie
I reach out to you

I'm building my Kingdom of heaven
I'm just a pilgrim of light
Collect the golden hearts
I'm building my Kingdom of heaven
Live and let live in your life
Open up your heart

All around the world
So many people who bleed
Strenght love and honours is the feed
that we need
Raise up and shine a ray of light
I reach out to you

I'm building my....

Another day
I loose direction
Memories of yesterday, they call
Keeps me feeling small
I use to feel, the sweet conviction
Now I walk to crucifixion
Please, won't you catch me when I fall
But I can't take the screaming anymore
Still, there's nothing like your kisses, I recall

[Refrain:]:
You know I'm trying, denying
That you don't love me anymore
You're closing all your doors
Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
To find the way back to your heart
But I break before I start

I can't give up, to expectations
Now you leave your resignation
I, will miss you when you're gone
I guess, you can't take the screaming anymore
Remember all my kisses, like before

[Refrain]

I know I can't refuse the call
And your silent says it all
It's over
Don't leave me standing here

[Refrain]

You know I'm trying, denying. (Oh, I can feel your sweet conviction.)
No, won't you crucifixion
Inside I'm crying, I'm fighting
To find the way back to your heart
But I break before I start

Another day
I loose direction
Memories of yesterday, recall
Keeps me feeling smal
Of beast and man am I,
Transformed by the full moon's shine
I'm ripping the flesh, and eating the young
I am the unhuman one
All legends tell of me, creating a killing spree
What the legend doesn't say, is that I'm coming back one day!

[chorus]
Hide your children and lock the doors
Soon I come on my blackened horse and scythe!
Hide your daughters and shut off the lights
I'll come back for more when Satan needs more soldiers out for war: 
It's a Deathexplosion!

I'm riding fast, creating a storm, you can not hide from me
My horse is black but not as black as my soul
Death is about to soon explode!

[chorus]

It's a Deathexplosion!  It's a deathexplosion!
It's a Deathexplosion!  Deathexplosion!

[chorus]

The death that they know that is me is what keeps them in fear
Their lives are still haunted, not in life, but at night when they dream
Old legends they say that his offspring will keep on killing
I see the morning star glowing brighter day by day!

There's no escape, as the darkness falls...you can't resist, the Devil's call!!

Misanthropic - Frozen soul blaze black and cold
Luciferian - Slave to the beast and marked for life
Order from Hell - To send souls to the other side
In Dark Devotion - Living for terror and destruction

[chorus]
Executioner...executioner...executioner...slayer of the light!
Desecrator...violator...devastator...messenger of death!

Sworn to Satan - Morbid minds close horrid pacts
The Dagger Strikes - Blood is shed for the faceless one
Possessed with Murder - Angels of death amphetamine sped
At the Mountain - A body found in killer's park

[chorus]

Evil lives and death draws near
Serve blind that dreadful voice you hear
With violence, horror, pain and fear
To make them see the reaper clear!

Shot like a dog, emptied on blood
Life won't return, to the silent corpse!
In the staring eyes of both the victim and the killer...
All light has now forever fled away... the darkness fell to stay

Electrified - Stunned, down, and sacrificed
Two Shots for the Dark - Through the head and through the heart

[chorus]

Executioner... executioner, life destroyer!  Executioner, shadow in the night
Desecrator... violator, Satan's soldier!  Devastator, cruelty and death!

Feel the presence of me, risen from behind death
Invoked by lovers' touch, seduced temptating lust
Pulled back into this world, in that, their breathtaking flesh
Take form in woman's womb, reborn!  By faith to fulfill

When you have come to the end, will you stay or go on?
When you have seen the light shine, will you end there or try
To seek a deeper line?  To fill the hollow inside?
You just watch your moves, cause I am back from the grave!

Lazarus returned from the velvet deathzone!
I've walked out in his footsteps, there's not a hell I cannot endure
Lucifer rose in revenge and glory!
I seek to follow his footsteps so I can spread my wings, back from the grave!

When you have come to the end, will you stay or go on?
When you have seen the light shine, will you end there or try
To seek a deeper line?  To fill the hollow inside?
You just watch your moves, cause I am back from the grave!

Lazarus returned from the velvet deathzone!
I've walked out in his footsteps, there's not a hell I cannot endure
Lucifer rose in revenge and glory!
I seek to follow his footsteps so I can spread my wings, back from the grave!

With horror and reverence, staring at the face of the night open wide
My soul drowned in death, endless chambers so awesome and terrible
By will I returned!
I have been here before, now I'm back to wage war
Live an undead dream, the pain of lifetimes call!

Hidden secrets old as time itself, reach in and touch their flame...it's burning back from the grave!!

As I blast through the shadows in the valley of doom,
In a deathblack Cadillac, step on the gas!
With a double barrel shotgun, 13 demons in a leash,
My lady at my side and a pistol in my jeans!
Hellway to high, paved with bones.  Fill up the graves as the deathrate grows
All systems go, shut off the brain
Take you 'round the bend, really drive you insane!

[Tomas:] Death on wheels, speeding bastard!!
[Johan:] Mystery machine going faster and faster!!
[Tomas:] Carry on screaming, suicide master!!
[Johan:] On a road to ruin, a burning disaster!! 

[Tomas:] GO!!

I've chosen my way, deathrace king
At one with my pain, to get more kicks!
With a motor running inside my head
This demon fever.. gotta get fed!
All Hell is roaring under my hood,
Burning so bad, it almost feels good!
But don't try to follow, keeping the pace
You know I'll crash one of these days!

[Tomas:] And my smiling skull will be all that you see, to make you know that my soul's been set free!!
[Johan:] My burning skull will be all that you see, to make you know that my soul's been set free!!
[Tomas:] The world is on fire!!
[Johan:] Burning up my tires!!
[Tomas:] Every skull is smiling!!
[Both:] I'm a devil gate rider!!

Born to race!!  Crashing through the gates!!  Leathering on to Hell tonight!!

Feel the heat of these deadly streets, beating on and on.
Ghostly and evil... Cannonball Comet.
Nothing can stop it, you can't put it out

Harder, faster, so heavy it hurts
Blinding my eyes, blackening my mind

[Tomas:] So violent, I catch fire... fire, inside me!!
[Johan:] So violent, I catch fire... fire, inside me!!
[Johan:] Shooting through my spine!!
[Tomas:] Shooting through my spine!!
[Both:] Shooting through my spine!!
[Johan:] Like an octane action cyclone storm!  Riding the blasting sky!

Death is my whip in this race against time
Faster than light I fly through the night
I am the wolf in the sheep, flock of thine
You can't hold me down: To live is to fight
I have seen things that would've filled you with fright
I've been down to Hell; I've seen all the sights
I know I will die but there's no time to cry
I gotta go on this journey through life

[Tomas:] The world is on fire...
[Johan:] Burning up my tires!!
[Tomas:] Every skull is smiling...
[Both:] I'm a devil gate rider
[Both:] I'm a devil gate rider...on a devil gate ride, yeah!
[Both:] And I'm coming around the bend now, heading straight into everlasting fire!!!

Straight down to Hell I will go, I'll take you down with me...
Blood of divine, holier than mine...Wine of Delight I drink to ease my guilt.
Hoping to see bodies to bleed.  Hoping to see the beautiful art I've built.

Pose!  Pose naked with blood as your skin!
Crawl!  Crawl hated, my expression of sin!

Die, die, die, die!

Drain!  Drain your soul with the wounds I provide!
Take!  Take your place in my gallery and die!

Feel...your breath: getting stabbed away!
Our heartbeats...synchronized...while I make you pay!
Never...again...shall you spread your filth!
Bleeding...heart sympathy...shall you never get, from me!

How can the rest just live in silence
When the children are being injected with their rotting venom?
Led to death with 'belief' as the guiding light!
Trust and Deceit, hand in hand.  Born into slavery
Nailed on these walls are the scum of humanity
Parasites of life left for generations...to see!

Straight down to Hell I will go, I'll take you down with me...
One last statue I'll put on there, showing the face of vengeance!

Feel...your life...getting washed away!
Our heartbeats...synchronized...while I make you pay!
Never...again...shall you spread your filth!
My gallery is now complete...and my vengeance dies with me!

Inhale glory, exhale fear...no God or master to make me kneel
Inhale courage, explode force...I am Lord I break your laws
I raise my fist in blasphemy, with the sign of the horns...In praise of the rebel angel.
Who stood proud, stood strong, alone, against God
Cast out, thrown down.  Hated, feared and left to die!

I am the rebel angel, living like the devil
Rebel angel, to the death!

Call of the devil, follow the devil, fall like an angel, rise like the devil.

I take pleasure, the forbidden fruits...you fear my freedom and call me evil
Inhale darkness, feel the strength: every wound just makes me harder
I am demon, burning feathers...the wings of my soul turn into leather
Inhale vengeance, feed the flames: howling in hatred, screaming in Hell
You cannot control me; I'm so much stronger.
I'm your enemy, I'm your Satan...and this fire burns deeper than you'll ever know!

I am the rebel angel, living like the devil
Rebel angel, to the death!

Call of the devil, follow the devil, fall like an angel, rise like the devil
Call of the devil, follow the devil, fall like an angel, rise like the devil

Take it to the sky...from below...
Arise from the ashes...come take your revenge:
Burn through the heavens!!  Fallen angel fly again!!

I am the saint of sinners, defender of the devil
Rebel angel, to the death!

Flying through these nightmares, burning worlds of hell, yeah
Horror angel, till I die!

And on this path of pain, I stand all alone...
Rebel angel, to the end and to the death!


My will grows strong when Heaven falls down Hell breaks new ground
Tear up, break down and burn the circles around my life
God cries, who cares?  Your paradise is a childish dream
Behind the door death stands tall, awaiting all

This is our life of Heaven and Hell
This is our time for pleasure and pain
And the dead start to sing:
"When you go, you go forever
When you go, you go alone
When you go, you won't remember
When you go, you'll never leave!"

My will stays strong.  Commit the sin of being myself
Awake what sleeps, to be alive in a waking dream
I won't fade away, I won't trust the lies, I won't waste more time
Your world I leave, and as I look back, there's nothing I miss
Never will I give up my soul, nothing you say can change my way
You say: "Obey!"

Where I go, I go forever
Where I go, I go alone
Where I go, I won't remember
Where I go, I'll never leave

Darkness forever - death in excelsis.  Hell after Hell, after Hell, after Hell!
Death is forever - black non-existence.  Time beyond time, beyond time, beyond time!
Death after death, after death, after death!

Empty me of all your worries, concentrate on death
To find what really matters, it cuts me free, and I see it clear...
You try so hard to hide, to follow and fit in
But serving your life to the system's shit won't save you from your death!

So useless in the face of this!  So useless in the face of death!

There is only one thing to make me strong, to cleanse my mind from all the filth
My death...guides my life!

I won't follow!  I won't follow!  I won't follow!  I won't follow!
No... No!   NO!!
Death after death, after death, after death!

I saw it flash before my eyes!!  Blitzkrieg witchcraft!

Evil night, Hell on earth!  As the black sky turns to a white out of light!
Mushroom clouds of endless size rise and shine, blinding all, total fear is all you feel!
Scream in silence as your soul explodes!  Death construction war machine flying free on nightmare wings!
The only thing that you see is an insane black abyss open up, still the missiles strike!

You're gonna learn the hard way, that the world don't wanna be saved
So when it calls for doomsday... 
I'll kick back, step out!  I see...

Blitzkrieg witchcraft - massmurder megaslaughter!
Madness, terror - the occult power of destruction!
Nuclear warfare - burning storms of radiation!
H-bomb!  Sieg Satan - Exploding bodies uber alles!
Come and take it away!

Fatal end from beyond.  Black magician, politician, devastation ritual!
To be king, on the other side, a psychedelic kamikaze to kill all life
Burst command!  Death is done!  Horror power holocaust!  Demons dance in nuclear winds!
Extreme evil!  Terrify!  The sky caves in and breaks as you're falling down to Hell!

You're gonna learn the hard way, that your soul don't wanna be saved
So when it calls for doomsday...
Kick back, step out, watch it all fall apart!  You'll see:

Blitzkrieg witchcraft - massmurder megaslaughter!
Madness, terror - the occult power of destruction!
Nuclear warfare - burning storms of radiation!
A-Bomb!  Pure deathfuck - yeah, God really loves his children:

There will be peace and silence... in eternity
Your prayers have finally been answered!

When I'm long since gone, still you can hear me in this song
A voice from the dead, into your room to fill your head
Remember this, when I'm haunting from beyond
When the circle's closed, and this is sealed as the dead man's song!

When the stranger appears riding through your dreams...as pale as bones
A heartless killer in rattlesnake boots
Some say that he went down to the crossroads...and bent down on his knees
He sold his soul to the big bad black

Lost in the sand, temptated by the serpent's hiss
Voodoo drum - coyotes howl in the fullmoon's night
Now hypnotized, all alone on the desert plains
Expect no mercy!  You'll meet your fear as the stranger appears...

Enter deadwood saloon, now your protected world is gone
Your helpless mind is about to discover the living darkness
Let the game begin!  Let the desperate souls in!
He drains their strength and leaves them in the void of shadows, dust and smoke

The cards are given, now place your bets with your soul at stake
But as a sinner you live to win, throwing the dice...
You get triple six and flash a gain of gold!
He's never lost before, but now he's been given the dead man's hand

Shot in the back with a diamond bullet, straight through the heart
Where the darkest rivers run cold and deep, his silverdollar eyes glimmering death
As birds and blood come flowing out of his mouth, you thank the blackest ace
Fuck you and your God above, I pity you all.  I pity you all 'til you die!

'Til you die!  Dead man's hand!

When I'm long since gone, still you can hear me in this song
A voice from the dead, into your room to fill your head
Remember this, when the circle is closed and the stranger's dead
That even death can die in a dead man's song...

Raw power angel from Hell!  Lovely as sin, this image of me!
Reality cast in a spell!  Beyond all nightmares my sprit is free!
Alive!

Total Satan!  Total Satan!
Total Satan!  Total Satan!
I want it...give me all you've got!

To live the life I love!  To love the life I live!
It's all I see, all I feel, all I ever needed!
Oh so very bad!

Total Satan!  Total Satan!
Total Satan!  Total Satan!
Come on now!  Try it out!

There are no laws...nothing is sacred...total Satan anarchy!

The devil is in your soul when you come...
With the gain of the skull beneath your face...
Feed me with apples offered by women...
Blessed rapture with knowledge and lust...

Jehovah dictator!  We're not your slaves!
This is for all those you've sent down to Hell!
Say what?  I'm damned?  I don't care 'cause I don't wanna get to heaven!

Total Satan!  Total Satan!
Total Satan!  Total Satan!
Total Freedom!  Total Satan Revolution!

In splendorous pride and might...do everything you like, without fear!
Total Satan reign supreme!

It don't affect you

Crushing the life from within your soul
As a thought crosses my mind
Who is alive?
Murderer, my dark angel of God
Make me suffer in my eternal Hell
I will say goodbye to my pride
Your eyes turn from blue to gray
Like the stale cold winter sky
This is the last time I'll have to hear your cries
Murderer, my dark angel of God
Make me suffer in my eternal Hell
The hands of a maker, your false creator
Your message in a trap!
The hands of a maker
Take my inhibitions, burn 'em down
Learn from decadence
Eyes turn from blue to gray from my deception
Blacken the eyes of a tyrant
Rivers bottoms, take me with you

A self destructive pattern
A human God
Born from disease, warfare, the son of reflection
Hey messiah! Is this a game that you play
A reason for everyday brutality

Slaughter the weak

Words that stand on their own, never forgotten
Tragedy, hypocrisy, never forgotten

A self destructive pattern
A human God
Born from disease, warfare, the son of reflection
Hey messiah! Is this a game that you play
A reason for everyday brutality

Slaughter the weak

Words that stand on their own, never forgotten
Tragedy, hypocrisy, never forgotten

A self destructive pattern

Wars waged so meaningless
When does it end and peace begin
A reason for everyday brutality

Choking on the bullshit you feed yourself
A religion that promises everything
To those at will, the black sheep of humanity
So you sold your soul
To the first in line
You play the role of a savior
To make yourself look better
Bend the eyes of God, it all seems so much clearer
So you sold your soul
To the first in line
Searching for a cure, the plague of mankind
You play the role of a savior
To make yourself look better
In the eyes...

The scars of redemption tell me who you are
Deliver, relieve me
When I say the world was scarred by you
Plagiarism never lies
Resistance is futile

You play the role of a savior
To make yourself look better
In the eyes of God

From the moment at birth
Nothing has changed, your just living a lie
So you bow your head deep in sorrow
In your hands open eyes
Suffer from the ignorance that you wear
I decide on your life expectancy
Dreams filled with fear
Nightmares that bury you to your knees

Every ounce of blood
Scars that never even judge me
You seem to cry
In your pathetic waste of life

Knife in hand
In my mental state
I become something more
A wall of remorse
Social obscurities, nature of seclusion
I become something more

From the moment at birth
Nothing has changed, your just living a lie
So you bow your head deep in sorrow
In your hands open eyes
Suffer from the ignorance that you wear
I decide as you shut down the cause
Dreams filled with fear
Nightmares that bring you to your knees

An ounce of your pathetic waste of life weighs me down
I think its time you become extinct to this reality
An answer to a demise

The horror underneath this so called life
A passion for the blood of a martyr
A promise to forgive a world from sin
The plague that will forever murder man

As the coil unwinds

This time you will see my true feelings
The cell that you live in will remain
The liars forming the hollow grave
The inter sanctum of what made me
Liars forming another one down
Burn the cross so we shall live

As the coil unwinds
The meaning of the defined
As the coil unwinds
The meaning of life is defined

Say a prayer for the box life
I will become your eyes inside all this silence
Adore me as I scream
Say a prayer for the murderer, for you designed him
Say a prayer for the child, my only sin, my only soul
Say a prayer for the murderer, for you designed him to kill

Behold the truth, the coil unwinds
As the coil unwinds

I gave myself to you
Bored of the regrets, further from sane
Broken down images of violence still remains
As time withers away the words of those who've fallen
Face the son of a man in mourning

Bridges will burn
So will your lies
Bridges will burn
Your sacrifice

Take me away on your wings of lead
As we fall, the pleasures become perverse
Beyond desperate eyes
As you open the gates of a life left behind
The world we'll fight and I will rise above it

I tried to remember
I've seen this far too long
My soul is riped and torn
Time will open this cage revenge

Slit the throat of those that deceive
Bleeding from the eyes, do you believe
Persecute me for my sins
Destroying what you know into this abyss
Mentally controlled
A life that don't exist
Your beauty falls in line
Between broken fingers and a homicide
I possess my sin in my hands

Destroying everything you know

Live by the cross, the aftermath of God
My soul is withered, it's harvest time
Our hands are against our eyes
Blind from what you know
Your ignorance is bliss, your mistake

Destroying everything you know

Liars, they make the best of everything
The curse of one, pleasures burned
The wrongfully accused, backwards and abused
The reckoning carve this world
Don't inspire, this abyss is true
You know no one dies, we are the lifeless few

Don't back down

Inside a world of spiritual forgiveness
Shelter a place of peace
Nailed to your cross of doubt, why?
One stab at life, you see the truth
My hands bleed for you
Open the gates of Hell
Let 'em in, farewell
Tired of being like the rest, in your coma
Nail to your cross of doubt, why?

Wash away all thy sins, Christ
In a way we'll all crumble to dust

Time will open up the wounds that never heal
Cries, broken down, lies
Botched life, this will never become a life without sins

Eternal suffering, never forgive
The plague of ages, the guilty will form true
Take my hands, I bleed for you

A bid farewell to those below
A crushing force set to explode
The tears of shame, the tears of regret
Bury the axe, destroy and protect against lies
The horror of loosing your soul in vain

Sever the ties, unbroken
Sever the ties, approaching redemption

Remain in the past, it's better that way
Alone in your thoughts, the guilty will pay
Blinded by light, a shadow will fall
The blood of the weak is stronger then all true lies
The horror of loosing your soul in vain

As we walk through the valley of the shadow of death
We'll see our own reflections black out our eyes again

We'll see our reflections through lies
Tell me what's this suppose to be
As our thoughts become delayed from this shame

It’s getting late and you feel so lonely
Your buddy’s waiting in the hallway
In your room you’re going crazy
Leather pants or fishnet stockings

You say you like the band
Just right between your legs

Here once again into the night
With a stranger by your side
Juicy as a cherry, nasty fairy
Dirty Dark Diane

As you roll up and reach the doorway
You look around, you have no money
You want to join, you know how to get in
You’ll pay the bouncer in the toilet

They call you backstage queen
You’re just seventeen!

Here once again into the night
With a stranger by your side
Juicy as a cherry, nasty fairy
Dirty Dark Diane

Only likes long haired men
She’s a suicide girl
Tell you dirty stories, dirty bullshit
Smart as a donkey
Dirty Dark, Dirty Dark Diane

Talking, talking, you don’t seem to understand
It’s not me, in my mind there’s someone else
They control all of my thoughts and all my deeds
They can turn into reality my fears

You won’t help me
It’s not your aim
Not in this place

Can’t you see how they’re getting strong
You don’t believe, schizophrenic freak
Guinea pig with a human mind, that’s why I’m here
Let the show begin!

Voices won’t help me
It’s not your aim
Not in this place

Can’t you see how they’re getting strong
You don’t believe, schizophrenic freak
Guinea pig with a human mind, that’s why I’m here
Paranoid!

Game, playing with a melted brain
Fame how many screams for you knowledge
Gain, sanity is your domain
Pray you’ll never be found on the other side

As the sun kills the night
As the morning sweeps away all the tears
All my hopes fade away
I open up my eyes and here’s my nightmare
Just another day waiting for the dark

Let me dream everyday
All my life to the end of my time
As a ghost in a cage
Our eternal embrace

A fruit so sweet to taste, so long awaited
Pure ambrosia lips, heaven from your eyes
The spirits from the past, the envy of the gods
Cursed December days, rainbow turned to grey

And I cried everyday
And I prayed for the end of my time
As a ghost in a cage
Our eternal embrace

Let me dream all my life
To the end of my time
Just at night I shall praise
Our eternal embrace

You’re living for today
You’re staring at the sky
Everything is fine
You’re kissed by the moonlight
“How this can be so wrong?”
“Our souls were made to love”
“They’ll never have to know”
Not a pure girl anymore

Every night as I close my eye I see my heaven
As it lasts forever, as I’m falling
Everyday can you see me praying
Lost in my sorrow
I deny tomorrow, feel like falling down
Lost forevermore

The streets you used to walk
It seems they want to talk
The nailed one on the cross
He’s staring at your soul
A Shot few miles away
A mother screams in vain
There’s nothing more to say
Just falling on his grave

Every night as I close my eye I see my heaven
As it lasts forever, as I’m falling
Everyday can you see me praying
Lost in my sorrow
I deny tomorrow, feel like falling down
Lost forevermore

Tied on the bed, wish to be dead
Debbie has seen him first and she’ll start the playing
It’s easier with the blade but she’ll use the nails

In the club they chase their victims
Can’t resist the sexy bitches

They’ll steal your heart, they’ll eat your guts
Betsy’s getting hot, licks her sister’s finger
Slide on her breast “Color me blood red!”

Gruesome twosome, crazy sisters
There’s something weird
Their minds are twisted
The fury of 2000 maniacs!

Unholy twins, they look so sweet
It’s much too late, they’re closing in
Prepare yourself for the blood feast
Beware the Gore Gore Girls!
You watch ‘em dance, the sweaty chicks
You want to smell their teenage skin
A taste of blood, it’s yours they need
Watch out the Gore Gore Girls!

So many miles, I came from the North
So many years without an answer
Can’t find a place to live on my own
A shelter from the bale of living
The fire is melting the frozen ground

I moved across the edge of the world
No human being beheld these places
The whole of my life I’ve been running from thee
To find myself before the mother
Like a squirrel in the rattlesnake’s jaws

A tale without any grace, out of light
This is fortune of human kind
Fighting to live, crying to survive

“We’re just a drop in the sea of your reign
With our tears you feed your creatures
Now tell me please what nobody said
Who likes to spin this wheel of sorrow?
And takes delight from your pain”

A tale without any grace, out of light
This is fortune of human kind
Fighting to live, crying to survive

Let’s star another journey
We’ll bring you down the depths of hell
No need to be so worried
‘Cause we know how to come back
So just relax and feel the power
It’s time to bang your head
‘Til you’ll break your neck

You’re waiting for the rain
You’ lived through the sands of time
You’re riding in the dark
This time the Bride is back!

We knocked on Heaven’s doorway
But Peter came and kicked my ass!
Then we went to Valhalla
But Odin said “Get out of my way!”
No chance for us to reach Nirvana
So we went down to earth
To do what we do best

You’re waiting for the rain
You’ lived through the sands of time
You’re riding in the dark
This time the Bride is back!
You’re waiting for the rain
You’re riding in the dark
The Bride is back!

Everything has a price
Dreaming here is a crime
And she knows she’s condemned
Words she can’t understand
“Wash away the sin... Now”

Stand tall as she kneels
One of them’s getting near
Dad is scared, mother’s crying
The last one with his lies
“Soon you will be clean, pure again
Nothing to dread, believe and you’ll be saved”

How they pretend to redeem and to preserve
Stealing the gift of our love
How can they say that your life will be again
Worthy and just to be lived?

A silent cry, an aching pain
You’ll realize their evil game
A tool of death, a pool of blood
A farewell to the unborn
The scars so deep you’ll keep inside
A lifeless womb, a lonely bride

How they pretend to redeem and to preserve
Stealing the gift of our love
How can they say that your life will be again
Worthy and just to be lived?

It’s when they say “man, you failed!”
This time you’ve got to work much harder
It’s when they say “just go away!”
It’s time to stand and climb much higher
Nothing’s for free in this world just let me tell
Expect no mercy, no help ‘cause nobody cares
Don’t let anybody else decide for yourself
It’s hard to hold the line when you feel so lonely

The fate to walk against the wind
The will to rise above
Ride on my way to the unknown
I’m alone again

“You were not made to live as brutes
So keep your eyes on worth and knowledge”
The Greek of old, on his final route
He saw the ship devoured by water
Don’t be afraid to fight the gods anyway
There is no chance to be sure about the result
No chance to know if you’ll come back
It’s not a shame to burn in a tongue of fire

The fate to walk against the wind
The will to rise above
Ride on my way to the unknown
I’m alone again

Again, he fooled your heart again
And you’ll never, never trust any other man
Betrayed, no chance to forget
You’re tired, tired to get only pain

Since then you try to hide frozen memories
Under a layer of snow

And you bleed from your heart, your bleed in your soul
Your desperate cry is leaving you alone
You bleed from your heart, you bleed in your soul
You’ve lost yourself when your love was a joke
Tell me, Black Widow

Again, you fooled his heart again
No pain or sadness he’ll find in your eyes
His tears, the lies he believed
Enchanting siren, he’ll pay the price of pain

Since then you try to hide frozen memories
Under a layer of snow

And you bleed from your heart, your bleed in your soul
Your desperate cry is leaving you alone
You bleed from your heart, you bleed in your soul
You’ve lost yourself when your love was a joke
Tell me, Black Widow

You’re living your life running from love
Making them bleed as the made before
Sailing away in a sea full of lies
Searching for peace in the heat of the night
Angel, you’re wasting yourself

The shadows area taking the streets
They’re hiding the place where we used to meet
There’s no trace, so sign of you now
They say you’re gone for good
But I refuse to bow down

Lost in a dream
You close to me

But I’m all alone
Walking the streets of sorrow
Can’t look back
Can’t even think about tomorrow
If you’re gone
There’s no hope anymore
Anymore

The neon light shining too bright
Some people are crazy, they’re starting to fight
It’s hard to face the truth
It’s so hard to face the world without you

Lost in a dream
You close to me

But I’m all alone
Walking the streets of sorrow
Can’t look back
Can’t even think about tomorrow
If you’re gone
There’s no hope anymore
Walking the streets of sorrow
Can’t look back
Can’t even think about tomorrow
If you’re gone
There’s  no hope anymore
Anymore...

Cold in my land
Whate'er the time I've been
Running too fast or walking too slow
For a long time.

Tomorrow I will hate
And celebrate my greed
Wandering the waste
And tasting my heart,
Smells like sour and filth.

Tears don't belong to me
And no one else,
I'm running to my hell
'cause none of us can make a stand.

Running to my hell...

Cold rain, rush me into my hell
All alone when light's off.
We are born to procreate
And subjugate

Tears don't belong to me
And no one else,
I'm running to my hell
'cause none of us can make a stand.

Running to my hell...

Cold waste of a bloody
Taste we're alone
And ready to fall.
Frontiers without volunteers.
Who asked for a penny of love?
Skyscrapers with hellish view from above
We're ready to fall.
Cold soul, if you're feeling old you can call
When you can't go on...

Our souls are not ready for life
We're gonna have a fight
Our souls try to be swept from our bodies
Coming out to the streets
They'll complete what we did
Or what we wished to destroy.
They'll mess up despite the next

Outside our souls react to raging crowds. Tonight
They'll kill and demonstrate what fight is all about.
Inside I'm wandering, wandering
"What you're doing,
What you do has the logic of a soldier
And people will curse you"
Blood and ruins, blood and ruins

Our fragile conscience lies awaiting for a war
Where liars and honest people fight to get some money.
Inside I'm wandering, wandering
"What you're doing,
What you do has the logic of a soldier
And people will curse you"
Blood and ruins, blood and ruins

Inside I'm wandering, wandering
"What you're doing
What you do has no meaning,
Consider the fight's all around".

Inside I'm wandering, inside I'm wandering...

The weakness of time
We'll pay for it.
Distrust of the next
And fear for death.

The poor and the mighty
Live in the same place that we shared.
The good and the evil
The destroyed
The destroyed

Death is our freedom
Makes us equal men,
Regardless of our place and birth,
Regardless of our plans and deals,
She'll never break her promises.

She decides for us
When the wretches stand
In the wreckage.
She makes us more miserable.

There's no compromise
To escape our lies
They're running to nowhere.

We had a feeling, a shelter, and some air to breathe.
And exposed to distant clouds, we never saw sunset and dawn.

Death is our freedom
Makes us equal men,
Regardless of our place and birth,
Regardless of our plans and deals,
She'll never break her promises.

Slow decay and rest
As we're running fast,
And the mighty ones are nothing
But the last ones.

There's no compromise
To escape our lies
They're running to nowhere.

Death if our freedom
Death is our freedom...

From mortal wounds we suffer..
Old men outlaw us and break rules
Decide for youth
And celebrate
The disorder, the great disorder of this life
The departure, the sad departure to the endless river
The disorder, the great disorder of this life
The departure, the sad departure to the endless river

Old inside
Cold Outside
In my hall where they can spy
And lock our minds
Me conscience's blind
And maybe it's worth to give up.

And an old man came with giant steps
In the room where I lived alone.
He kept his promise to destroy me,
Then cut my body and ate
My heart and brain

He stole my slice of glory.
Outside the door the world has gone.
Suicide of youth.
We celebrate.
The disorder, the great disorder of this life
The departure, the sad departure to the endless river
The disorder, the great disorder of this life
The departure, the sad departure to the endless river

When you embody all the silence
That make us proud
I walk like death through your gates,
And thunders light.
A sound and our world is gone

It's a sound that burns lies
And weakness of might...
It's a sound that goes down
With the scent of the mortal divine.
It's vengeance of tears
Cleaning all of your smears.
It's a promise of fear
For the rebels who live.

Gone with the world without a cry.
It's a crime
That we can go on
And nothing goes wrong.
We're slowly down.
What have we done living just like parasite?
They watched my tears
And looked inside him...
And slowly down

As we're collecting the remains of a tragic life
I look in your eyes and in no time we're paralyzed.
A sound and our world is gone

It's time again
To take my last minute train,
And I let my hair down.
In spite of my prayers
I have found something bad
And my plans now belong
To the edge of this place.
And a weekend I've paid,
My extreme sacrifice
For a piece of worth

I'm spending here
I'm spending here my time
I stand
And I hope to fight

Hold my hand
Hold it if I'm lost
Hold my hand

Killer, what you know 'bout me?
Killer, what am I supposed to be?
Killer, what you know about me
Is what I'm wrong, wrong.

Killer, don't be proud with me.
Killer, I don't feel like living.
Killer, what you know 'bout me
Is that I'm wrong, wrong.

I'm gonna give my very end to you
Cause you will be my murderer,
You'll be my killer
It's like a final dance for me and you
Where if you'll get some pleasure,
Well, I will get it too...

Killer, what you know 'bout me?
Killer, what am I supposed to be?
Killer, what you know about me
Is what I'm wrong, wrong.

The world if miserable and fits for fools
I mean it ain't worth living, my life is meaningless,
So just take aim and pull the trigger, but
I just forbid you to kiss me or kiss me before I leave.

Killer, what you know 'bout me?
Killer, what am I supposed to be?
Lady, what you know 'bout me?
Or it is better to say
"Do you know what I used to be...?"

Lonely in my world,
I accept this role
And mornings and evenings crawl.
Lonely in my world.
I'm so scorned
To watch this light that makes me blind.

And people get me nervous when they say nothing matters.
Every day is dull and filled with grey and I feel better.
And the silence, and the silence turns the soil dry.

Feeling or agony.
"Free from my world". It's what I can wish.
What more than I can see?
I've had enough, all in all it's better
When it comes to leave...

A fall is a cold blow inside
That paralyze my mind.
The sight is blurred and white
And all around me is dark

Feeling or agony.
"Free from my world". It's what I can wish.
What more than I can see?
I've had enough, all in all it's better
When it comes to leave...

Lonely in my world,
I accept this role
And mornings and evenings crawl.
Lonely in my world.
I'm so scorned
To watch this light that makes me blind.

And people get me nervous when they say nothing matter.
Every day is dull and filled with grey and I fell better.
And the silence, and the silence,
And the silence turns you dry.

Words have no meaning,
When a fake broad smile
Tells my living in a rainy night and I
Feel the thorn of life.
I walked a river.
'Twas my tears at night
My running fast was not my last sacrifice.
As the hours went by I found...

Days of nothing
And loneliness will be my bride,
Life is thrilling
Like motionless pieces of dolls,
Days of nothing
And loneliness will be my bride,
Life's a murderer
And you keep being a stranger 'round the crowd.

There's something strange when our life's deranged.
Someone would lay the blame on somebody else

Hall is crowded
When the door is locked
I don't live here and don't forgive who you are
'cause you hurt me more than once.

There's something strange when our life's deranged.
Someone would lay the blame on somebody else
Whoever lives with a fault inside of him
Is nothing and nothing will be changing here.

Don't go straight
Take me by the hand
I stumble like a fool
And the stupid standing still
I stumble like a fool
My stomach still aching and although
I'm walking, walking straight

No one can cease my prayer.
Silence once again
Right on my way.
You can be here beside me
Yet my innocence comes from mother earth.

And I fell like I,
Like I am underground.
I'm so alone that I could cry.
And I feel like I,
Like I am underground
I'm so alone that I should cry.
And I feel like I,
like I am underground
I'm so alone that I should die...
And I've seen this all before
It seems it's something you adore
I can't conceive your total indifference
If silence speaks a thousand words
I hear them screaming through these walls
I won't let you tear your way through me

You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out
You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out

Oh-oh-oh-ooo and now you want control
Oh-oh-oh-ooo I won't let you take hold

And I'll be there to see you crawl
But I won't catch you when you fall
Can you conceal your sense of sanity?
I see right through your blatant lies
I see the truth behind your eyes
You clearly lack of all trace of humanity

You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out
You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out

Oh-oh-oh-ooo and now you want control
Oh-oh-oh-ooo I won't let you take hold

You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out
You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out

Oh-oh-oh-ooo and now you want control
Oh-oh-oh-ooo and now you want my soul

Frozen under a new sun
Black light, shadows at play

Hold on till the end of night
(Hold on till the end of night)
Hold on till the edge of light
Hold on till the end of night
(Hold on till the end of night)
Hold on till the edge of light

I can see you
Dancing in the fire, flames are geting higher
I can see you
Underneath a new sun now

Take me under a new sun
Black blood is fading away

Hold on till the end of night
(Hold on till the end of night)
Hold on till the edge of light
Hold on till the end of night
(Hold on till the end of night)
Hold on till the edge of light

I can see you
Dancing in the fire, flames are geting higher
I can see you
Underneath a new sun now

My spirit breaks the caress
But I'm keeping it inside
I'm burdened by the distress
But I'm keeping it inside

It's coming back again
And my soul it wants it all
I need it now and then
I'm confused as my world beings to fall

Delirium & Desire
In oceans rages fire
Delirium & Desire
Soulless we conspire

Underneath dying lights
This semblance won't let go
Underneath darkened skies
The sun drops like a stone

Delirium & Desire
In oceans rages fire
Delirium & Desire
Soulless we conspire

Delirium & Desire
In oceans rages fire
Delirium & Desire
Soulless we conspire

I used to take you and then erase you
To see the ghost play between our eyes
This soft confession and it's slow obsession
Will hear the dove cry beneath our sighs

You crave what you kill
You stay what you will
Nothing remains without us
Will love stay the same without us

I feel I'm fading, I'm drowning, wading
This soulless savior has lost control
I left you needing, alone and screaming
But now without you my soul is cold

You say you what you will
You crave what you kill
Nothing remains without us
Will love stay the same without us
Nothing remains without us
Will love stay the same without us

Nothing remains without us
Will love stay the same without us
I'll take all the blame without us
Nothing remains without us

Dark rain will fall
Clouds cover all

'Cos I been looking for something
I've been looking for something that makes me feel
I've been looking for something
I've been looking for something that makes me feel

And I think you need to know
I see the core of your worlds collide
I see the core of your worlds collide
And I fear
That it's all a lie
I see the sun and the earth align
I see the sun and the earth align

Day turns to night
Souls leave the sky

I think they're looking for something
I think they're looking for something that makes it real
I think they're looking for something
I think they're looking for something that makes it real

And I think you need to know
I see the core of your worlds collide
I see the core of your worlds collide
And I fear
That it's all a lie
I see the sun and the earth align
I see the sun and the earth align

And I fear
And I think you need to know
And I fear
That it's all a lie
I see the sun and the earth align
I see the sun and the earth align

On calm black waves she rides
Where the stars they always sleep
She lies on her long veils
Floating through the endless deep

And all alone she sails
As the silent river flows
She dreams of lonely worlds
As the breezes come and go

As the breezes come and go
And still she sleeps

She passes through a land
Filled with sadness, filled with tears
She's sleeping through it all
As she's dreaming of the years

That came before the pain
And her getle fall from grace
The river flowers wilt
As the tears stream down her face

And I am a hollow man
See my soul its torn apart
And I need to understand
How this sadness stole her heart
I am a hollow man
See my world its torn apart
And I need to understand
How this sadness stole her heart

What came before the pain?
And her gentle fall from grace
The river flowers wilt
As the tears stream down her face

And still she sleeps
Sweet dreams my love

I know the real is unreal
I am fire you always tried to steal
You're chaos, naked and cold
Your seven tongues tell a lie that can't be told

You are sublime
You've taken what's mine
Now you're dancing with fury
In the sun

There's a thousand shades of you
There's a thousand shades of you

I've been scattered for days
My cold despair has now leftme slain and torn
Your benevolent gaze
It feeds the silence and feeds your lover's scorn

You are sublime
You've taken what's mine
Now you're dancing with fury
In the sun

There's a thousand shades of you
There's a thousand shades of you

This white and aimless road
Makes all my senses overload
My soul's turning black
There's no turning back

I'm waiting on you
Times falling fast
I'm burning again
As all things collapse

It's an old, an endless game
I'm the only one blame
A cold rising sun
Will leave things undone
Again and again

I'm waiting on you
Times falling fast
I'm burning again
As all things collapse

I'm desperate, I'm longing, I'm lost in despair
These are cracked, but you're still unaware
This life line between us could soon disappear
We're shattered, we're broken, we're taken by fear

Have we seen this all before

Don't leave me now
Behind these silent walls
Don't leave me now

There's hope still despite the despondency here
I'll rest here a while, as I hold back the tears
This place is a tomb, will our love rise again
The space that divide us, we face and transcend

And we've seen this all before

Don't leave me now
Behind these silent walls
Don't leave me now
Save me from it all
Don't leave me now
We fly before we fall
Don't leave me now
Save me from it all

Wipe your tears away
Wipe your tears away

I've been waiting
Waiting so long
Come back to me now

Everlasting love
Always and again, never taken
Soulless selfish lust always in the end,
hearts are breaking

Dawn opens my eyes
Find her, realize

Home is cast in stone she engraved

Unrelenting doubt
Always in the end, leaves me searching
Conscience calls me out
Always and again, never learning

Dawn opens my eyes
Find her, realize

Home
is find on the path she has paved
Home
is cast in stone she engraved

Everlasting love
Always and again, never taken
Soulless selfish lust
Always in the end, hearts are breaking

Dawn opens my eyes
Find her, realize

Home
is find on the path she has paved
Home
is cast in stone she engraved

Don't regret
An eternal sun
If we seek
A divine light
Forgiveness nourishes the lies
I'm returning to the soul
