ï»¿Look at all of us running
Always behind always late
We're always playing catch up
In this human race
All of these young men dying of old age
To feel alive could cost you everything
It's hard to hold onto your ideals
When the dreams you've caught
Aren't the dreams you've chased
Now your hearts are bleeding
To keep this pace
The kid you were
Hates the man you became
You can't remember what you wanted
You just can't
Feel the same
Remember what you wanted
Remember what you chased
All of these young men dying of old age
To feel alive could cost you everything
It's hard to hold onto your ideals
When the dreams you've caught
Aren't the dreams you've chased
Now your hearts are bleeding
To keep this pace
The kid you were
Hates the man you became
You can't remember what you wanted
You just can't
Feel the same
Look at all of us running
Always behind always late
We're always playing catch up
In this human race
Remember what you chased
Music city never shines so bright
As the nights when coming home to those lights
I have traveled the whole world wide
And I can't find a better place to reside
Every single tour takes me kicking and screaming
this Nashville heart's still beating
Take me back home to all the kids in Rtown
Who know me for me
My heart's back in music city
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Alert the skies as hell retreats
I'm saying goodbye to my apathy
To all the workers in this town
Losing their minds in this great modern hell
The ghosts have their guns and they will destroy
As wolverines break out
But tell Sophia and Alcina
We're still kicking it
Take me back home
Take me back home
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Music city
Is where my heart beats
With the heart of a child my tainted eyes have
Not lost every ounce of innocence
I still fight to hold onto my youth
I won't give into death like you
Kingdom of youthfulminded
Positive but not innocent
We still fight to hold onto our youth
We won't give into death like you
We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing
They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything
With the heart of a child
We will live forever
Children live forever
We won't be misled
We won't be misled
We won't be misled by broken dreams of wealth
We won't be misled
We will live forever
Children live forever
We will live forever
Children live forever
We are not a product of society
We are not a sick dying breed
For the meek will inherit the earth
As the weak watches its riches burn
We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing
They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything
Hallelujah
Children live forever
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
Dreams are the soul's misfortune
Meaningless and insecure
This heart could try and heal itself
But I've gone and lost the cure
He was dead to me years ago
But losing her was an eternal blow
I've spoke in the past of the broken
But now I really know
So why jump your turn
I'm living day by day
There's strange comfort in apathy
I'm living day by day
There's strange comfort in apathy
Lay cold and alone in the ground
Will it be paradise or will you burn
This is all a gamble
Until it's your turn
He was dead to me years ago
But losing her was an eternal blow
I've spoke in the past of the broken
But now I really know
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Son to none
No home but the roads I roam
Son to none
No home but the roads I roam
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
We're all brokenhearted
These wheels are turning in my head to slowly go
Where I'd rather be instead laying low
Skin and bones we know
Made of stone move slow
Move slow
These are the days
Fear takes its hold around my throat
Lost is the chase
Hands and feet won't move
All these things we'll lose
We'll lose
These are the days
Fear takes its hold around my throat
Lost is the chase
Giving in to distance left to go we can go home
Before the devil knows I'm dead
This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Murdered or the murderers we're all the same
Murdered or the murderers we're all the same
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Hell walks the earth his name is pain
I swear to God I've seen him
He's no stranger to me I know him well
I'll write your name into the stars
We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
Salvation for these many scars
They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
Can you hear me
Can you tell me what this all means
And why God am I here
We are all the same we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places
If all roads lead home then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by day
Am I in hell Am I in hell
You've taken this a step too far
We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
We need you staying where you are
They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
Can you hear me
Can you tell me what this all means
And why God am I here
We are all the same we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places
If all roads lead home then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by day
Am I in hell Am I in hell
We all fight for peace of mind
We all fight for peace of mind
We all have hell at our backs
Haunting our dreams
In the beds in which we weep
We all have hell at our backs
Haunting our dreams
In the beds in which we weep
My cynicism was never yours to boast
You've greatly missed the point of what was said
Robots zombies cattle herded by others' words
It was never meant to be like this
Breeding your anger was not my intention
Though that be the case I've made this bed
And now we all have to weep in it
Hate dissension between brothers of the same
Words meant to provoke thought misread instead
Was I even right in my accusations
My words are a weak foundation for your war
Hate dissension war
Did I start this
Hate dissension war
I can't stop this
I can't stop this
It was never meant to be like this
Breeding your anger was not my intention
Though that be the case I've made this bed
And now we all have to weep in it
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
Speak of regretting and all the risk we take
Speak to the morning and when our eyes awake
When the world sings of all its trouble
And I hear all about its pain
I'll listen in for its groans are not in vain
It's hard to remember how these dreams were made
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
With no place to call home
Run away
From everything you've ever known
Run away
With no place to call home
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
I have no place to call my home
Gain a friend then I lose a friend
I'm losing touch with everyone at home
It's really hard when you're born born to roam
I've run and run
I've drove and drove
Three hundred thousand miles of lonely roads
To see the ones I love at home
Move on and on without me I'm just a memory
Is this the life I chose
Have I chosen poorly
Or has it chosen me
Will it let me go now
With action comes reaction
We're all a slave to something
Dreams aren't meant to be lonely
Will you answer me
Is this heaven or hell
Is this living the dream
Or is this a living nightmare
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
With no place to call home
The world is on fire
And I've done nothing but watch it burn
The world is on fire
And soon it will take the last of us
The world is on fire
The world is on fire
I've been thinking a lot these days
What if hell's not all fire and devils
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
My hopes and dreams are setting
They're setting with the sun
The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast down from the Heavens yet never Fallen
He  whom gods hath scorned
Eden's imbecile perimeter ruptured
I am of the Shining One
Whip merciless their flesh
Goad with firebrands
Trumpet the advent of the bloodspray
Enraptured by torment and flames
Broken on the rack crush the cult of Nazarene
My cup runneth over
Each Nazarene I kill
Is one thorn more
In the crown of their false saviour
A king foresworn in a halo of flies
Prostrate disciples of derisive subjection
Their spirits exude deification of defeat
A talisman profane  vile birthright borne
Enslaving vigour as if nailed to a cross
Scoff at this inheritance of wretchedness
The Daimons erect shatter shackles of deceit
Sons of Vengeance consecrate burning ways
Wolves no longer in the guise of the weak
Gammadion upon our shields
The Conquerors draw nigh
Pentagrammaton  ashes to dust
Unbridled conflagrations purify
Christhammer
Swoon  poison souls procured
Acknowledge the rot of divinity
The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast aside despair in chaos consecrate
For visions become truth in wakefullness
The seeming sorrows that mark my face
With head held high are tears of joy
I am the spear in the wound of christ
Corvus corax descending
Through ashes smoke and pain
Stark sepia sigil of strength
The revealing stench of victory
Lycanthropic ripping death
A baptism in annihilation
Drips from the jaws and howls
An ultimate oblivion conceived
Wartorn
A solution for flesh and bone
The morbid throne the strong revere
With genocide
Our might makes right
Where charnal houses
Leer at the world
Where crown and cudgel
Ferocity
Rains from the skies
Withered rotted bodies unburied
Lay piled in stacks instead
Vermin swarm and vultures gather
To feast upon the dead
Anthemic holocaust and hate
Stern lord of war and vengeance
Rough beast slouching eternal
Resolves the world to dust again
Wartorn
Beasts of prey strike with lightning speed
Wagons of war collide
Metallic plague armored locusts drive
Into the storm of steel
Exterminate  feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar
Motorized slaughter panzers smash
Reliquary immemorial of runic conquest
Wincing crablike across a scarred land
Into the storm of steel
Bombs flagellate as poisoned rain
Corrosives soaking deep
The skin of earth erupts in sores
Wounds and filth unending
Winged death  spurting flames vilify
Splatter the Whore of Armageddon
Gutteral ejaculate  mummifying rust
Disintegrating bones to dust
Exterminate  feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar
Petals ripen glisten with yearning
Sanctified vessel inflamed
Fervent fingers twitch the gulf is closed
Envelop the pillar of alabaster
Cockroach entrenches in some awful orifice
Excavating living tissue
Barbaric caress  greased up and slick
pain scraping a backwards bending
Clamps smear open a warm paradise
Ribcage and vertebral column contracted tight
Bars stretched beneath the skin
Lips pulled back and drawn for curing
Penetrate  probing swollen infestation
Fisted into comprehension
Rigid so to bend contorted and suffer
Straight jacket of sadism
Phallelujah
Sanguinary rite of passage
Sweet tongues of fire
Phallelujah
Paroxims of union
Phallelujah
Judas tongue scrapes spit
Bites the hand that feed it
Infectious features baring cracked teeth
Bleeding gums of joy
Phallelujah
Flaying souls breach the vestal wall
Chorus of angels consortium of pain
Enriched blood of freshly esoterica
Mingles with man in fluid form
Outpouring thrust pelvic abominations
Thick film of sweat grim lubrication
Soon to suckle maggots at her breasts
Celebrate the palsied throes of innocence
Phallelujah
In the dancing blaze of world cremation
Ashes usurp the thrones of untruth
In the glowing funeral pyres
Where shadows and smoke no longer betray
Furnace fired  matter laid bare
The true nature of existence
Reap the whirlwind
Mercifully engulf the current universe
Reap
Reap the whirlwind
Unfetter a seedling chaos to spawn
Strip away the artificial mantle
The veneer that pompously claims
That this world is worthy of salvation
Self satisfaction  armageddon
For that is all we can ask for
Every leader a fool with a facade
Every holy man a sinner
Every love a selfish lust
Every war an orgy of laughter
Every living creature a cancer
A defilement  this flesh corrupts
Reap
All truth is fabrication
Almighty hallowed nothingness
All paths spiral downwards
All answers winged lies
All questions should be phrased with axes
Indulge celebrations enshrined in blood
Astride the inexorable
Jericho's wall shall crumble divine
Grasp the horns of the Dragons of Chaos
Furious we ride
Lascivious  that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
Ripping sacred vestments  venereal debauch
Frozen phalanx thrusts
Dampened walls summmon hallucinations
Erupting wicked cold that burns like fire
Daughters of joy await the vulgar visitation
Depravity nocturnal  emissive lusts they crave
Inject impurity filth and fornication
A winged satyr raping unsullied maids
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm of the despicable unborn
Urinary baptism and licked clean
Eat until it poisons me
Enslaved to those fleshly folds
Erected into bleakness
Unchaste phantasmagoria
The salacious sordid pulse prevails
Corrupting every orifice
Greedy for love
This flesh corrupt
On bestial bloodstained wings
Rites of disgust
The incubus obscene
Lascivious  that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm of the despicable reborn
What is to be of this pestilience
That makes empires tumble like tears
The dust of millenia  fallen ages
Staunches the flow of dawning horizons
Obscuring 
While the days crumble as their hours unfold
A sensual swooning  prophetic mocking
As the soils swallow the seeds of the past
Each one of us to his own
Embrace
Drowning in hallowed solitude
Swallowing the void
The pallid hope revealed at last
Embrace
*Why should I fret in microcosmic bonds
That chafe the spirit and the mind repress
When through the clouds gleam beckoning beyonds
Whose shining vistas mock man's littleness*
Throw off those shackles of sufferance
This penance of one thousand ordeals
I wield the scepter of destiny
Choose the means of my own death
Give me both nails and a hammer
Harness those ecstasies of death
Prostrate myself on cruciform
At last
With swift feet I made my way
Helmed by a cacophony of despair
Deaf to the legacy of youthfullness
And beauty and joy since pined away
Yet now a rush falls upon my ears
Of dripping  whispering words
The hole of emptiness I pour through
Unveils the caress from far beyond
Now no longer can I ignore
What goes before has gone again
The silence of immorality
Satisfied with this one fell step
Plunge beneath the waters 
The freezing embrace of the goddess of death
Awake Sons of Vengeance rise
Rub the dust of twenty centuries from your eyes
Today we conquer the self  tomorrow the world
Men of war defiant  to ashes fall the gods
Apocalyptic deeds  fierce archonic might
A knell a pall masking honored rites of spring
The empyreal majesty of abyss winds
An affirmation of struggle
Like wolves closing in for the kill
Making holy our war immortal this glorious night
A brotherhood of iron  falling in we march
Shout into the star shattered Dawn
We are Sons of Vengeance
Blessed and bold
Reborn in hate
Fingers of scorn fists of furious destruction
Discipline of steel beyond the roar of all war
Unleashed lightning storm brigades to be
Powerful creative joyous and free
There is a land in the middle east region
ruled by black gold
and a crazy religion
There is a satan with certain charisma
the tyrant has the power of words
His bible is built on barbaric foundations
laws from a forgotten century that live again
to die is a straight way to glory
Black widows march proclaim their own slavery
and even children grow to fighters in war
David fights Goliath Uncle Big Satan
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
A hellish old man plans the overkill riot
it's his demonstration of might
We won't retain to fight it back
save the ballance land he rules
We'll hold the power on the border
they've sworn the oat
hand die on his order
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
So it's destroyed the work of a century
the iron towers melt down in the fire of hate
No survivor in a war out of gain
pain or glory described in the book of all fates
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
He is responsible

Wings of an angel

Rising from the night of time
rising from damnation
growing furtive to old size
a thousand years old nation
Finding victims for their Reich
the lands' got a lot of strangers
they call back the crystal night
to burn the war creation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Then the last man of their kind
finished life in prison
he's a martyr for their aims
started killing seasons
Now they march the insane hords
call the NeoNation
again the right hands risen high
a skinny revelation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Banned graphitti on the walls
words of hate and murder
waiting for their masters call
back in line and order
In a land where neighbours are strangers
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Seventh day restless I wait
yes I wait for the right word
twelve o'clock this is my time
time to change to the nightbird and like
a snake I am winding myself into tight jeans
the look on my face's gonna make all the
girls know what I mean
I come in the music stops
and you see everyone turning
then I walk cool as I can
straight to the bar and start smoking
I feel hot looks in my back
and I'll soon chose my victim
I am the king and my right is to show you
what I need
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
so show action and go
I think of the time that I waisted
how can you tell till you've tasted
Why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life
My straight face is lying about motions
that live in my heart
like a figure of stone
I am waiting for you to start
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
I think of the time that I waisted
how how can you tell till you've taisted
why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life
You're running into tragedy
signs announcing danger
for your life
will end in agony
and your bodies will decay to dust
Dust you are created of
and eternal laws can never change
change in our universe
dust to dust decays
You'll roast in flames
with the soals fo no name
your bones burste under mountains of bones
A voice from some
whereis calling your name
when you're in league with the gods
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
Everything that you achieved
all you tried has been in vain
you're treated with indignity
somewhere in a nowhere you will
fight
for the right to survive
don't blasphemise the holy signs
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
you will decay
Somewhere on a border
forced to march in line and order
looo men in greedy hands
Lured with hope for future
pressed in contracts
leaving them no chance
but to leave their land
They're nameless young men
bleeding their hands
on the edge of life
and they feel the hate
treated like slaves
There's a shanty village
where they are folded in dirt
dirt and a mess
intimidations breaking
the free will of men
free will of men
free will of men
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Somewhere in a office
noble looking and expensive
accepted by a corrupt state
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Locked in a cage
tied with invisible chains
on iron walls of pain
faces expressing their torture
denying their age
1000 years
reflected in mirrors of eyes
and brain
flowing rage
a rage crushing in fragments
past recorgnition their mind
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Back to back here we stand
our guns they are ready and loaded
ten steps forward and then turn
the strike of the bullets will hurt you
Eye to eye with icecold looks
that make you feel there is danger
they have might to hypnotize
and they will never release you
You search for the stronger
you search for the truth
you're searching so long
wasting your youth
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search for the truth
fight it out if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search
Search for the stronger of two
Keep cool bleed and fight your fear
Success's laying only in your hands
just try hard the end is near
your name will be sung through the lands
You search for the stronger etc 
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out
etc 
You ride on a silver spider
captured in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way to help
You walk through tubes of mistery
you see light at the end
but when you reach the exit
your're cought by thousand hands
You ride on a silver spider
captures in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way
You fall pictures create the lies
You fall but your mind denies
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
don't you lose your dreams tonight
In the night
You sail on a purple ocean
the wind inflates your wings
burned by an old emotion
your wooden sailboat sinks
When flames of memory touch you
you'll see they've burned so long
and deep in a nest in side you
another dream is born
You fall 
Hold on 
You ride on a silver spider 
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on save dreams for me
Look at me nobody cares
Just a mirror passing by
Looked inside
I've lost my pride
Stay with me not for so long
It's alright no needs no hope
Such a miracle
looking back
Times gone by
and life wasn't bad
Lord light my way
Fill these withered
careless hands
Oh skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh skies are falling down
Skied are falling down
See the birds are back
At the docks and everywhere
Here in Lisbon realized
This whole world
so strange and divine
Lord light my way
Fill these withered
careless hands
Oh skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh skies are falling down
Skied are falling down
Sat beside the meadow
Watching weeds agrow
Cleaned up all the ashes
Of my soul
Wrote down my own sentence
Now you take your way
Fades the last remembrance
Of your lovely pretty face
I after all
Just a lonely man  a lonely heart
Working on the future
Floating on fate
Faced the circunstances
Cleared up the shades so
Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting life's been wasted
maybe I wanna die some other day
Hear the whispers of your hope
The answer wasn't told
No don't laugh seeing me cry
The end I've left behind
the whispers of your hope are left behind
Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting life's been wasted
And I've tried
Maybe you deny
Words of peace
For the future of our lives
Bring to me
Something else than a broken heart
I won't wait 'till my life is wasted
maybe I wanna die some other day
So time is waiting
Now overloaded
See weeping eyes
Let me alone
Angels crying
Back to the war
Angels dying
Rest in their fall
Come to me try to see
future is not what you wished it to be
'cos everyday seems the same
To the whole mankind
sowing the seeds that'll never grow
We're waiting for the dawn
The change must start right now
Oh scars are fading
seeds now may grown
feeding no more lies
raising as the sun
Angels are crying and dying
for holy chants of
fareweel to kings
overthrown by the purpose light
Nobody ships when the glimpse
of your target comes behind you
Trading places with those faces
Won't go far but you must hold on
You don't know what you've got until it's gone
And without fear to disappear
You pay the price for your life
Hope as high as the mountains
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside to stay alive
And face my fears with the will to live
Nothing's easy that will please me
As I search for truth and hold on
To everything I've found in 'til I'm gone
And at the end my life is spent
I'm facing death with the path I went
Hope as high as the mountains
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside to stay alive
And face my fears with the will to live
Desolate
This is becoming
It will take the treasures invested in your soul
As the sky turns red and the oceans boil
Apophis discriminates against no one
To turn sand into glass
We'll be done by midnight
When the sky is turned to stone
And its earth against earth
The death of the sapian
The wise and the faithful
Only the man with the reason
Will this notice be useful
Destroyer of worlds
You can black out the sky
Obscene is the waste of this earth
A celestial body for that it is cursed
More then this plague of man
We yearn for wings and lungs with air
As our reign on earth comes to an end
Suicide in mind for a death before our time
The corruption flow is our fatal crime
So hold your breath until your lungs are wet
We're failing but we're alive
To find your piece of mind
Search in this great divide
They pick the teachings only fit for today
Manmade gods moulded in our only image
Blind faith and myths compose all our history
There was no sin
But the absence of truth in the world
I won't take part in the foolishness held
We die for freedom
Only the wise survive
We die for truth
Paying the price with lives
We abandon this logic at expense to ourselves
We abandon this logic at our expense
Let's watch the suns burn into darkness
They don't all have to be from Earth
Be all from Earth
In the white sky view of the future
When time has told if we are worthy or not
Let's watch the suns burn
In the end when committed to darkness
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run run run
playing out my very last chance to run
taking me down off this cross
lay me down in the dust
where my eyes cant't see
no more sober words of love
this is my last chance to run
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
to live to be alive
just run run run
take a look in the mirror
my mind turns into my heart
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run run run
playing out my very last chance to run
my last chance to run my last chance
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
the mirror tells me
all I need to know
so I forget it after all
it's all for you
but somehow I my not stop
so I stopped smiling
so I stopped breathing
in all that you did
in all what you are
here I stand
where my past is as far as the sun
in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything
in my head I say your name slowly
for this point in time
my life is going to cave in
in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything
when you move your hand over my back
this could be the very last time
the very last moment
one moment from somewhere else
only for you
the bright lights shine
but the truth is I am lost for words
my life is going to cave in
at the heart of the matter
just take a closer look
make it easy cause it is
it's all black and white when the music stops
it ends so it begins
sometimes I think I understand
everyday I know that
I may be closer to
to something beautiful
you are tomorrow in today
and you will ever be
the you I know is fading away
no guts no glory
the you I know is fading away
just stand up and be counted
can't say goodbye to somebody you don't know
so it begins so it ends
I think I  understand
sometimes I think I understand
allow me to join your presence
no need to argue even for one second
oh what a beautiful view
the beauty in your eyes
the warmth of your smile
a heart of perfection
I would fight the darkest roads
to protect your shining eyes
these are my unarmed words
but I'm not the one
you're looking at
still I did
but doesn't arise
please don't worry about me
I'm already lost I'm already gone
but you don't love me and I do too
I wish I could
I thought you would
this oppressed soul of mine
got no tears for long time
this is getting wrong
just bear it up and say the truth
as early as your eyes do
this moment will race forever
all my life I was running away
but the sad part is I'm still here
where did I go wrong all along
now I can leave my things behind
cause it's all going off without me
now the time has come
to clear the air and hit the road
damn what we wait for
I've got no time to lose
driving in my old car
mind out
maybe our backlight has gone
for sure we're already drove too far
just leave my grave undone
listen to the voice in the radio
the tragedy starts from the very first spark
all good things come from above
I'm tired from being put off
I didn't really know how to call it
a name to conjure with
you're a little bit more then I thought you'd be
and now you're drowning me
and get lost in the sea
Explanation 
This is about growing up with pain and struggle
Everyone has their own story
Most of my scars are not physical but mental
I wouldn't be who I am without those lessons
You dig a hole 5 days a week
So you can sleep at night So you can sleep
Carry the burden carry the weight
It will drown you one day
And then you'll sleep forever
And your body will rot
Carry the burden carry the weight
It will drown you one day
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
Than be afraid to live
I'd rather be dead
You dig a hole
5 days a week
so you can sleep at night So you can sleep
Carry the burden carry the weight
It will drown you one day
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
You won't get to quench the greed
You won't get to justify the want with the need
You won't get to live beyond your means
Six feet deep
Your body will rot
Coffin keeper
No one will remember your name
Because it always comes to me
The world turns and I'll forever mourn
And I'm sorry that I wasn't the closest
And I'm sorry but I always cared
I could see this coming a mile away
Didn't do enough to show you another way
I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam
I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam
Haunt me as I roam
You needed something to something to hold on to
Give me a reason to breath
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave
Tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
 it's slowly starting to shut me down
When I wake up I feel sick
There is no end to this There is no end
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
Nothing worth keeping comes that easy
This pain this world won't defeat me
Never knew what to say or what to do
To voice these thoughts the best to you
When I wake up I feel sick
There is no end to this
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
When I Wake I feel sick
There Is No End to this
No words to hide the pain behind my eyes
So where do we go from here
give me heaven give me hell give me an answer
ARE WE LOST WANDERLUST
I'm still staring at the sun
screaming out my lungs
I'm staring at the sun screaming out my lungs
When did the compass break
when did we lose our way
give me heaven give me hell give me an answer
ARE WE LOST WANDERLUST
I'm staring at the sun screaming out my lungs
I swear with myself as my witness
that I I'll get through anything
I can get through this
I swear with myself as my witness
Still dying still lying through your teeth
Look at me I still remember everything
And I hope you walk the earth alone
Get those middles fingers up cause
Fuck the government fuck the cops
Fuck authority and fuck the system
And fuck you too if you're fucking with them
On repeat like it's Groundhog Day
Life's short Down for anything
FUCK A FAKE FRIEND
I still remember everything
Get those middles fingers up cause
Fuck the government fuck the cops
Fuck authority and fuck the system
And fuck you too if you're fucking with them
So now the lines been drawn in the sand
this is for real we ain't playing no games
And we felt the same
Now I only see the darkness inside
Only sorrow remains
And I drown in the shame
That I feel better for it
But something cut so deep and you bled out of me
Fuck it's so damn hard Fuck it
A house that used to be a home
Go figure
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
How many years have I known you
How much time have we shared
How many lies have you spilled into the air
you will never know why
I pray
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
I hate this world that I see today
We all have ugly days
I hate this world that I see today
Do you know what it's like to be bested
Have you lost have you fought  not won
Do you know what it's like to be tested
Do you know what it's like to overcome
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can beautiful in every way
We all have ugly days
I hate this world that I see today
We all have ugly days
Stuck inside these walls
Stare through the windows into my soul
Just tell it where to go
It's got no hope  it's got no home
I'm afraid I lost I am worse
No regret No cure I accept this curse
Stuck inside these walls
Stare through the windows into my soul
Just tell it where to go
It's got no hope  it's got no home
I'm afraid I lost I am worse
No regret No cure I accept this curse
Mother father what have I done
Trust me
Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long say farewell
live and let die
It is cliche but every word I truly mean
there is so much beauty to be seen
And you're beautiful too kid
You will be loved you will be warm
And these paths in life are meant to be walked
Believe me
Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long say farewell
live and let die
Just don't give up
Just don't let go
I know you won't
Things are gonna be different kid
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better and everything will change
It will get better and everything will change
Every day
Set the goals embrace the illusion
This ain't the way supposed to be
Confessed yourself to death
And wore your scare on every sleeve
This candied maxim stays the same
This pained reprieve
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
Bury me
In this suit I wear today
Another wasted dream
A dream that fades away
Staring at these walls
Inside this fucking hourglass
Just stand in line
This lonely mile
Is bleaker still
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
It's a long road nowhere
This journeys fate intact
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
Burn
The fire will light the path
Trade for the nightfall
The pattern is so predictable
Another reason to dream in the moment
Not be denied
I'm not a product of circumstance 
Or a name in a line
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
It's this sheltered life that you're living
Try to recognise
Your choked up words
Are empty still
Fight Blood in the throne room
It's over
These towers fall
Blood in the throne room
It's over
This towers fall
Your lies
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
We're alone
Fear is the change
That brings you down
Blood in the throne room
It's over it's over
Mirror my lesson learned
Tailored for reason
Laid to rest your lies
It bleeds the weak
This shallow empire is built on lives
Lives crushed down as they tried to fight 
This darkened heart will bear no compromise
And with no thought of weakness
Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
The task is simple
Put more coins in the hand
Now hold your tongue
And lay your loyalty down
Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
Blue blooded tyrants
The faces of sin
They wear the masks
That smile with mercies grin
Black gates protecting
Their fortress of lies
It holds the vial of ink
That scripts our demise
This greed infects
Their blackened hearts are reaping
Gold and green
Amassing as we lose the fight
For now we see an altered shade of real
There's no one left to conquer
You're born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
Crusade
To march with a heart filled with rage
A lust for revenge
Traded for blood
Stare as the life drips from the blade
It seals your demise
How easy the hand fits the throat
Your mind so cold and hollow
Will disgrace and destroy
Yet still claim reprieve
So easily
Your faith blinds you all
You the restless martyr
Now receive
A solemn note from callous hands
These are the words you must obey
Take life for belief
Vile actions echo through time
Now raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
Lead the guilty to the rope
Unite and raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
Never forgive never forge
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
You trail the hounds
That chase your dreams away
Hopeless you are
The vultures lie in wait
Graceless road ahead
Your fate is undisguised
Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again
Dare to fail
The rope's around your neck
Obey the call
When it sounds like hope
Crushed by apathy
You'll forever be lost
Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope
Wake from this nightmare
Step from the ruins
That shadow fates embrace
Break from these chains
That shackle
Rise and prevail
Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again
Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope
Lay your dollar down
To pray before me
These words that i'll preach
Are set to stoke the fire
Raise your hands
This gift of hope I give to you
Your faith is my cruel device
Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
For I
The Evangelist
You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Is this the price of belief
Now praise
The souls that give will now be saved
My words are lies laced with disguise
Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
Immortal I stand
You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Be forever lost
You'll never find redemption
no matter what the cost
This is the price of belief
What sight to witness
This is darkened room shows no escape
Chaotic bleakness
These thoughts that haunt my will
To be free
A cursed fire burns inside
As I embrace the silence
The peace is fuel for the machine
As I feel
Wrath of fate
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
I'm fighting this solace
I pay my debt with anxious fear
But still I face this
Rising tide of blame
Am I the criminal
Or am I the victim
Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
Am I the liar
In that I must doubt
Is this still real
Am I the noble one
I set them free
Now set me free
Sleep soundly no more
Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
Sit the fuck down little boy
I've seen a million like you
And I wish everyone could see
Cold heart and hollow mind
This story's getting so old and dire
It's rehashed pathetic and weak
Wretched you stand
Desperate you'll fall
You'll struggle in vain
Blind hate so unjust
I'm sick of hearing from you
The lies
Your cruelty without a cause
Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed
Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same
Shameless tainted soul
Your tale will never be told
Denied archaic it's echoes are weak
Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed
Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same
Dark reveals
I sense her luring eyes
And her evil intentions
Without a voice
She calls me into her arms
But I feel a cold embrace
The sweet sting of fear
Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of existence
Take my hands
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave
Alone
I fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Towards me she steps 
In silence
Bitter her stare
Can I turn away from this
Our fatal engagement
Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of your life
As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternity
Now take my hand
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave
As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternityRites of death
Rites of undeath
We're falling
We're falling down
I told you we're into deep
Transfer life into what's dead
The act of human playing God
Redoing the acts of medieval
Witchcraft and the worship of dead
We're falling we're falling down
From our throne so supposedly high
When we confront the power great
The might of our own creator
Transfer life into what's dead
The act of human playing God
The rites of undeath
Is the testament of our own death
Enter the halls of distant memory
Feel your previous actions once again
Your lies and deceit
Your hate and long lost love
Walk through the hallway of you past
Sense the evil like a whip from beyond
The doors keep on forever
Possibility is endless
Wander through one of the bronzecovered doors
And feel the weaves of old times cruelty
Run from the darkness the endless void
And get yourself cornered by the demons of fear
The presence of something unseen carries on
Of old time cruelty
the past haunts you
of old times cruelty
save me
has now turned it's way back to you
The demons from the past haunts your soul
Walk through the hallway of your past
sense the evil like a whip from beyond
the doors keep on forever
possibility is endless
Your ideals are wicked and deceiving
how can you find peace
you seek the righteous but find the void
Die by the sword of live by the book
Glimpse your death within the scythe
seek the righteous find the truth
the book of eternal youth
Of generations
cold as stone you wander still
awaiting your inevitable death
your quest has ended where it began
But is there really a life for me
is there a place to dwell
pleasures of the flesh
vio dolorosa
Of fear and despair you've wandered
of hatred and grief you've slaughtered
I've seen you in your darkest hour
I know you as myself
But is there really a life for me
Via dolorosa memento mori
In you I've found my nothing
in you I can't hide my pain
in you my love has gone
in you I've kept my cold
Captor of sin you've stolen my past
via dolorosa
I've wasted my life for you
My hate you create
My blood is water
my life means nothing
my warmth has vanished
The grip no longer holds
When passion abandons
The bonds no longer clutch
And the rope screams you name
A path of daggers
But where to step
A hallway of illusions
Of what was
Duty heavy as a mountain
The battle draws near
Your shoulders carry many
Still death seems remarkably void
You wonder fate in lack of faith
What you consider luck may be God's will
A wanderer of the light will never die
Before God gives his approval
A path of daggers
The crown I carry as an aura above me
Is the proof of who my saviour truly is
My mute cries overheard
My blindness is seen
My tears washed away
My feebleness became my strength
Duty heavy as a mountain
The  battle draws hear
Your shoulders carry many
Still death seems remarkably void
A wanderer of the light will never die
Before God gives his approval
A path of daggers
When love is lost only hate will remain
I am in pain
I am the cursed one
Life is not what it was meant to be
What I didn't ask for has now turned my way
Somewhere in a garden it all turned wrong
Things I once believed in have now turned evil
Yet I pray Deliver me from evil
But another spell pulled me away
Will suicide break the ring of curse
Tomorrow I'll be gone so don't look for me
My life took more than it gave
Betrayed and deceived I will now pass away
And with the gun in my hand my questions
Are soon to be answered
Will suicide break the ring of cure
Satan and god the thought passes my mind
Heaven and hell it's not up to me
If the Christians that I've seen
Represent the true God of heaven
Then it's not a place that I want to be
But if I'm blinded please open my eyes
And help my now
Will suicide break the ring of cure
Tomorrow I'll be gone then you'll be all alone
His seemingly perpetual glance of doom
As he rides he wind being the ghost of gloom
Running darkness all around
A knife in her hand
Fall rising screaming the name of her beloved
So weak and so weary
Something blackening her thoughts
A cloud a force a weight
Finding her true love lying in red
Is this reality or just a vision in her head
To be the knife as well as the wound
Is all that concerns her
Overwhelmed by a burden like hordes of fear
The obscurity of the vale of tears
Grasping for safety which lies all so near
Incresent malice of the vale of tears
Wandering oblivious in the foggy twilight
Shades of an obelisk shines so bright
Incredulous thoughts bewildering her mind
Is there really a god to find
Halting through the darkest of forests
The obese and extraneous at her tail
This haunting lingering to the extreme
She is about to quail
Then a formless mass of black went skyward
She stopped she listened nothing
Silence an eternity passed
The silhouettes of something unseen a presence
The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring
The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring
Recovering of the dead
Impossible for the living
The making of a copy
Is destruction of mankind
The earth is in it's autumn
The leaves have hit the ground
Corroding this earth is dying
Not knowing you'll face the end
The coming of Christ
Is the return of X
The art of the Y
Is in the new spring
My hands in the open wound
The knife clutches near
The blood of my veins spread out
My flesh become soiled
This desperate act of loss
The pain of knowing why
My mind slips into a blur
Upcoming questions as I die
Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled
Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil
Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail
Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled
 as I die
Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil
Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail
Death is my goal / Death set me free
In my living hell I can no longer be
Please bring me back home
Where I can be free
These Cowards Awaken
To guard their dominion
Enslaved to the King
A living sacrifice
Raised to see no light
Known to no other face
He edges near with unsteady hands
Struggling to wield his blade
Advancing forth with reckless force
I witness his dismay
Nearly scythed by his sword flashing forward
Mine finds its way beneath his flesh
He strikes the worst has come
Fallen to my knees he looks on in triumph
He did not see my sword go through his back
No longer will the bell toll
The King will surely know
I watch his eyes go blank
His body falls from my blade
I feel my fingers tremble
As it grows closer
I wait for a chance to escape
It prowls this tomb waiting for new prey
Once human hope has all gone
As I wander through this nightmare
No thoughts cloud my mind
Kill or be killed
I must be the predator tonight
Wasting our lives for this
Fighting a war for nothing
Are we all so mindless
How can we cope with such catastrophe
I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light
Blood is shed and bodies strewn
Across the battlefield
Sons and fathers die in vain
Now I will rise to be their shield
Lay waste to their towering castles
Set fire to these gates
Those who are innocent will escape the storm
And those who have sinned shall pay
With their lives
Fuck their meagre existence
They will be purged
I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light
I've had enough of begging
For everything that I want
I'm sick of fighting
For what I've already earned
Dragged through the dirt
Silenced and hurt
When will this come to an end
I shall reclaim what is mine
Just give her back to me don't waste my time
I will reclaim her she's mine
No mercy for you fools who stand in line
This can't be real
My eyes are bloodshot my hands are shaking
What am I supposed to feel
Take my hand or be forgotten or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love
I shall seek you dead or alive
I swear this will be the last time
Cannot forget you you're trapped in my mind
I'm done with trying I'm bringing you home
Take my hand or be forgotten or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love
She's not real
The flaw in her facade you coward
You drained the very spirit from her eyes
She lies
He invokes the collision of nations
To abuse the crown with false intention
Those who stand above him
Live beneath his reign of terror
He is not royalty he rots beneath the sky
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay
You couldn't run this kingdom
If you felt further than yourself
The might of the world is against you
I'll have your head if it's the last thing I do
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay
This hero begs for incision
He wanders aimlessly
His vision is no longer blinded by his majesty
I've taken everything and yet he still persists
I see her face I can feel her in my arms
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
A phantom follows him wherever he may go
The guilt eats him alive and scars start to show
Revenge won't bring him back
Although red is all he sees
One of us will die tonight
On that we can agree
On that we can agree
I see her face I can feel her in my arms
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
He looks to the sky in anguish
I can almost taste his hatred
A fire burns where only I can see
And he will spare no blood to get to me
Our eyes meet there is no turning back
Not now nor ever again
We made the choices that brought us here
We will pay in anger and fear
Forced to do this fucking dance of death
We cut away until there's nothing left
And with his last shred of dignity
He falls down and looks up at me
I am the god the chaos and destruction
Behold the powers of my wrath
I am the sword
The burning blade of vengeance
Your blood in my hands
As I embrace the black fire of the end
Ashes rain upon me when heaven is in flames
I am the bringer of your damnation
The judge and deliverance in one
If I say there shall be darkness
All light will die
I rule the world without a sun
With sorrow I behold the demise
The ruins of empyrium
With sorrow I behold it was fortold
When angels fall we have seen the last dawn
I am counting hours
Waiting for the sun to set below horizon
Blinded by the light until the
Darkness will fall upon me
And I become as one
Last few restless hours
Until the daylight will reach its end
I am granted with great powers
But blinded by the light until the
The pyre of gods black flame within me
Purgatory
The fire of wrath inside
I burn alive
Throw of the scent
To seize the chase of life
When one with death no light in sight
I have been told that before the end
The angels will come angels will come
Years has taken the best out of me
The sharpest edge
Endless burdensome journey without a rest
Murder in cold blood instead of a suicide
This crime is justified
I have killed myself so many times
That for me without a doubt
Heaven is denied
I am here I am waiting In silence
With no fear of dying
No more bleeding inside
Waiting for the black sun to rise
I embrace
The depths of oblivion
I am engaged to the escapeable end
The void that once was a strength
Consuming and fears
Became too intense
Destructive
I behold the days that are numbered
In my perdiction
The end has been forseen
I am unable to accept this failure
As weak as I am
I have no strength in me to pretend
The throne that once
Marked my strength
Is now a token of my failure
I can't recall
That the summer came this year before the fall
Leafs didn't grow on trees grass wasn't green
No lifesigns to be found
It's like a soundscape of silence
The final harvest has become
with bare hands we sowed the fields of ice
Lats crop that died on the ground
Into the frozen soil
Where I bury myself to be reborn
I can't recall
That the summer came this year before the fall
To The land of thousand frozen lakes
Like a snowfall
I have become to question my existence
The purpose of life
The essence of the creature I am
These days will be remembered
As the dark ones
When all life withered away
Death came with me side by side
Our trail across the land
Left only void behind
I have become more than my reflection
I have overcome the sickness
The weakness of my blood
I am the plaque I am the flood
I have become more than a man
Weak flesh seals inside a god
I follow
I walk the trail
Of my shadow
It walks ahead
Leading away
From the light
Darkness walks beside me
Drifting away
In your now so seeking eyes
The taste of confidence
In my mouth
I want to give you
More than I can
Words from you
Is a touching expression
Haunting
Bitterness
Is tearing me down
To be with you
Is to be with the world
Untitled reasons are carried with the wind
But you leave me
With that stolen look of love
These days I hear our hearts beating as one
And you know for me
You will never be gone
Does love come wrapped in lies
Am I flying just to fall
And as I grow older
Life seems so much more colder
It's not a secret of mine
That I want love to really hurt me
Your bright smile at dusk
And all my love is blown to bits
Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you
Our words are so far apart
Mine broken yours full of dreams
But let me find you in those dreams
And take you home tonight
Do you think the sky will ever part
And leave a tiny hope of love
For us to hold on
But to what why or who
Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you
Serenity
And the ice cold feeling
Of an uncertain future
Spark glow in the dark
Waiting for no one
At the halls of tomorrow
Surrender may I
But only if you beat me twice
Beat me twice
I can't see through
Your lies and your crying eyes
your crying eyes
So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die
Would you believe a word I'd say
If it was true
if it was true
Could you challenge your horizons
Into a voice of silence
a voice of silence
Wherever you may fall
I'm falling with you
falling with you
And whenever you may leave
I'm leaving with you
leaving with you
So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die
And so the day went
We had our time
Now we met at the park in July
I took your hand and held it high
I dreamt that this love
Could be undone
We shared our feelings
We had our moments
Maybe you were the one
No love can ever have a place in me
I'm closing in
On myself
Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate
And so the day went
We had our days
Now we were at the park in July
You took my heart and held it high
I thought that this love
Could now be done
And so the night went
The moon was full
Now we slept at the park in July
We took our lives and nailed them to the ground
I knew that this life
Could now be gone
Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate 
Trying to see but can't break through
Silver skies talks to me like ghosts of the past
Ignoring call from electric skies
And the house of cards
Fall to the ground death
Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still lost in the white lines
Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
A December could only apply to myself
I can go back but I can't move
Temptation can burn
But will I drown
Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
And so may I be the next to know
Knowing the times before they are
In these evenings
The blood seems to boil
Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white
I'm still the one I used to be
It's now colder than the freezing mind of you
Alive and glowing
Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white
Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
And heaven will know the taste of rain
Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
No matter where you go you will always be dead
I bring you to the slaughtering of life
I scream goodbye love to a dead world goodbye
You why you loathe me I have become regrets
Why you loathe me I focus on all the pain
I cannot begin to feed endlessly
Low below the ground you will find me
Under grave snow on my head stone
Low below the ground you will find me
I do not want to know anybody's fucking name
I do not want to hear about anyone else's pain
I cannot sustain much of society's ways
Cannot stopcannot trust cannot back away
Keep quiet do not speak only I can say
It is all about you you know it's a fact
It is all about you why is that
Only the enemies know about my revenge
Only few have told the story and lived
Only the ones like this have blood to shed
Only to this world will you always be dead
Cannot escape your own labyrinth of strain
Feebleminded you cannot have what you may
It is all about you you know that's a fact
It is about you why is that
Unknown follow the path I have shown
Capable spite can only be my real label
Face down smell the entrance to my grave
Unrestrained focused to make life my slave
Does he have a plan does he have to live
Why be afraid to be near what is left to give
Does he have to live what is left to give
My beautiful burning hate
Decadence the way I feel about my inner self
Pestilence a sickness I cannot rid of
At peace with the hate in my heart
All this is another focus on my madness
Explain it attempted misery addicted sadness
All this is another focus on my madness
Explain it attempted misery addicted sadness
End time witness end time never alive
Writhe forever always held together
Don't you ever see forbidden agony alive
Love for me died long ago everywhere I look
Of the knowledge of my grandfather's side
the sword is forged and it will be mine
At the dawn I take my horse and pride
and to the victory I will ride
The autumn leaves falling again
Through the eyes of a bird is this scenery seen
How the beauty turns into darkness
And how everything is lost once again
Years have passed since someone grew the flowers
The place was designed for this
Once it was dwelling for a success
She waited for him at the doorway so anxious
She loved him so deeply that she couldn't see
Finally he came and looked right into her eyes
And fired his gun straight into her heart
So crash the dreams of a young one
This life was gone to never return
And that's the sight to haunt him forever
And she sleeps in a silence so cold
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories
The justice is just how it is seen
And she sleeps in a silence so cold
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories
The justice is just how it is seen
That keeps going without it
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me
I pull the trigger to escape
I have hated you so much but now I know
It would be pointless forevermore
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me
I pull the trigger to escape
Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world
No difference has been found
Nothing more than dust
Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that canÂ´t be denied are lost
CanÂ´t you see that nothing really matters
CanÂ´t you see what you are doing
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system
So every conclusion is built on empty basis
Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that canÂ´t be denied are lost
CanÂ´t you see that nothing really matters
CanÂ´t you see what you are doing
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system
So every conclusion is built on empty basis
Taken my time and gotten only what IÂ´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within
Reflection back burns like hell
I didnÂ´t win so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow itÂ´s me who to follow
I shouldnÂ´t have let go no way  I know
Her eyes I see as I close my mind
Opening my soul for her to bind
The riddler comes to me to ask
Do you have to hide behind your mask
I am not the same I used to be
And now I feel painfully free
Have to forget all the rain
Just to recall the infernal pain
People change I know they do
Yet I canÂ´t change my point of view
No answer to all questions asked
So pack your bags and finish the task
and die
Many deeds with no meaning at all
Even so I stand tall
And without a fear I shed no tear
And face what is to come
No more back against the wall
No more roaming the empty hall inside my head
Where all is dead where shines no light ahead
Out in the distance for back lies
The essence of life and highest dreams
Behind the point of knowledge
Where the sense of truth so pure and fine
Is cast into the endless time
Taken my time and gotten only what IÂ´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within
Reflection back burns like hell
I didnÂ´t win so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow itÂ´s me who to follow
Yet no pitch black letters shall be written
For the future reveals its curtain
IÂ´ve heard the eager call from down below
But IÂ´ll stand tall not letting go
No pitch black letters
IÂ´ll stand tall
Not letting go
Will let go
Flashbacks from the war
Calm silence before the fight
Snowy road covered in blood
Suicide by my side
You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore
Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished
Hearing echoes from the eternity
Still fighting only the enemy differs
Once a soldier so great now afraid of death
One great enemy of men
Forgotten and buried deep those words will be
Time takes itÂ´s own guaranty's freedom
Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished
Weak fire burning on
And the last chapter is soon ready
But the quill drops from his hands
And the story remains unwritten forever
You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore
Finally I can see it all so clear
The lies and contorted reality
It took so long to realize it
But now I am free from their chains
I know IÂ´m all alone
But I donÂ´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane
I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the worldÂ´s balance
Because I see it all now
IÂ´ve lost these many years
The lost one whoÂ´s shed too many tears
Must recall revelation in the dark
For past and future for all under my mark
IÂ´ve been drowned IÂ´ve been crowned
IÂ´ve been dead and yet so blind
I have reached the end of my path
The knowledge the wisdom behind my wrath
I thought it was all right then
But now IÂ´ll put an end to it
They knew that one day IÂ´ll find out
ThereÂ´s no way to make it undone
I know IÂ´m all alone
But I donÂ´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane
I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the worldÂ´s balance
Because I see it all now
Everytime I wake up youÂ´re beside me
Every moment I feel you in my arms
But as soon as I open my eyes
You are gone like a frail dust in the wind
Again
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
This is the silent song of the dead
Hear the violins play now And fall
Everytime I wake up I see you there
Every moment I look out of the window
Your smile I see behind the mask
But soon the image disappears and
IÂ´m alone again
IÂ´m alone again
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
When the winds are gathered in one place
When the darkness spreads and no one stands
Never could complete
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
The autumn leaves falling again
Through the eyes of a bird is this scenery seen
How the beauty turns into darkness
And how everything is lost once again
Years have passed since someone grew the flowers
The place was designed for this

Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world
No difference has been found
No difference that I made
And though the shadows are everywhere
ItÂ´s all so simple that way
To live again just another day
But we possess something that canÂ´t be found
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
Use all the means to make the world yours again
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
We see into the forthcoming day
Our minds are open wide Eyes open wide
And they canÂ´t force us regardless of pain
To be like them again
All these hours were there waiting for you
But the time was running years ahead of you
ThereÂ´s no sign for salvation in the end
There is no gate to let you in
This is the beginning of a new day
So claim the time and lead the way
Heavenly light that now shines ahead
Is the proof of the new beginning and the end
ThereÂ´nothing for you here
Follow your people and leave these lands
The hope has forsaken this place
The ship is waiting for you
Please take my word
Our time here is at its end
To see the future IÂ´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
Leave now thereÂ´s still time for you
Forget your consort itÂ´s time to go
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees
To see the future IÂ´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
You are the only one left anymore
All the others are gone
Abandoned cities and sinister landscape
Is your kingdom now
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees
From time to time I feel the same again
The sorrow and the hate for this world
Many days just thinking all these lies
And all this hatred in me
Many days just thinking all these lies
And I am nothing but a lie
The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program life
Far beyond the light I am
IÂ´m running as fast as I can
But the world slowly fades away
And so do I
The reason is the blade of mine
The answer is the fear of time
The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program life
Is this what we have been searching for
Is this all what we have been waiting for
How can they be so stupid they can not see
And my personal worldend
It doesnÂ´t mean just death
And my last words for the mankind
Are vanished with the world itself
Star of Darkness shine on me
let satanic shadows draw near
the hour of eternal evil here
and I am facing the black circle
see my blasphemous torture
that you lit with darkness
the witches must be gathered
and to stand in your light
star of evil winds shine
let your shadow down on me
hear me cry out infernal names
near the circle of Ninnvam
the black eclipse draws closer
the witches are gathered
I dream fantasies of torture
and fornication before God
Diabolical night dwell our souls
let your evil shadows draw nearer
to possess our immortal flesh
and to breed abominations
You are the shadows dancing in the mist
You are the fire lightening the blackened skies
you goddess of sin
that have torched my soul
you are the lust and essence of my being
you goddess of death
that painted my heart with darkness
you are the hatred running through my veins
you are my hunger for the purest blood
you goddess of vampiric evil
that granted me thy life eternal
You are the pale moonlight reflected in my eyes
you nocturnal goddess
that granted me demonic powers
you are the twilight in the infernal storms
you are the despain in every enemyÂ´s soul
you goddess of war
that gave my life a meaning
you are the blasphemy in every sin
you are the pain called love that I cannot feel
you blasphemic goddes
that killed my emotions
oh you goddess of the eclipse
that dwells within me
oh you apocalyptical goddess
I worhip thee
Standing on a moonlit field
cold rain whipping my skin
warm blood draining me of life
oh I feel my death draw near
The pale moonlight is reflected
in the steel that has opened my veins
my life is now fading away
into the deepest of shadows
now it is time to end this mortal life
I kneel and welcome my death
my eyes are blinded by the fire
which has been feared for centuries
here I will burn for my sins
still there is nothing I regret
death is my deliverance
from this pain called living
with a sigh of relief I die
thrown into the raging fire
laughing as I burn
oh dark ruler of the fallen
this is my final sacrifice
I grant thee my life
The pentagram of my desires fullfillment
glows with inverted unholy inner force
baphomet I draw your sign deep inte my flesh
enter me and use my satanic body for war
Grant me a touch through Leviathan
set fire to my soul of AntiChrist
God of the underworld split open my black heart
fever runs through my blasphemous being
I am my sacrificial gift to the goatlord
I cry out to thee Baphomet appear in me
create a storm of immolation to kill God
possess me now and see all my hatred
I am a human torch of devestation
master of teh grim domains I call your names
while I rape the angels of an impotent God
He weeps like a lamb to the slaughter
cast down from his blooddrenched skies
slowly we sail across the river Styx
and I hold up his head by the hair
the godforsaken water is bloodred
and the ruler of chaos stands ashore
he spreads out his blackened wings
and blasphemes sadistically the priest
I drag the worthless priest ashore
he screams endlessly in naked fear
I am an eternal veil of evil torture
and I take pleasure in his agony
he is being crucified upon a cross
and boiling blood is poured upon him
his face explodes in bursting heat
as I whip his soul a thousand times
Summoning voices from distant fields
calling for magic of Satanic might
In midnight storms and thunder
around flaming stakes the witches dance
A fork of lightening cracks the sky
like a blaze in the winternight
still heard are the hymns
the hymns invocing Satan
The light of day is now cursed by Him
and united is his warrior hordes
the pale cold light of the moon and the stars
now blessed by he who reigns in flames
so creature of the night behold
hold with pride your banners black
and to thos that tremble in fear
His voice speaks with thundering might
I have given life to shadows grim
and blessed this world with darkness
now kneel and swear allegiance to me
Bacterial remnants of humans traverse the stars
As we fall through holes in time
Beneath glares of stars burning
Void of eternal night unfurl
Out beyond the threshold
In worlds yet known to man
Lurking near the portal's gate
Where black holes burn away
VENIT MORS TE SUPERARE
BONUM EST MORTIS MEDITARI
Dimensions shattered by tombs of time
Collapse the galaxy on human life
Outside they wait to cloud the gateway
From beyond I see the nothing
The field which chains all being
Levitated somehow made weightless
Moved by some unknown device
Synthetic gravitational environment
Adrift in the cosmic tide of ice
Lost to the abyssal waves of time
Floating eternally with one open eye
Cryogenically contained living without life
Celestial epitaph for all of mankind
Far below the earth
Beneath the caverns
Beyond the light
Dwells the terrestrial race
And forms of life
Beyond those known to man
Suffocating aura emanating decay
Limbless horror radiates
The fetied reek of plague
Planets burning away
Celestial bodies decay
Planetary funeral
As world go up in flames
Tides of blood for sacrifice
To their alien names
Born of blood and starspawn
In times beneath the earth
Siphoning the life source
but is this the first or the last time again
Opening between the gates on either side
Spiraling Awaken in another mind
Fall Through nothingness
Suffocating
The glass freezes inside your veins
Die Release your flesh to the astral plane
The violent plain of suffering
Your blood has vitrified
Boiling the pulp beneath
Liquefy your mind
Fear the pain
Fire awaits
Buried
Underneath the sand in the desert
Opening how the ancients foretold
Glowing
With the light of god in the temple
Offering thou to the astral beast
They came to mine the planet
For those who live under the ground
Inside the synthetic world we know
As the human mind
These beings are hiding outside of time
Tethering starseeds inside your mind
Corrupting your DNA
To make your soul obsolete
Replicating inside thoughts
To make your inner self fall asleep
Caught between the empty fields of time
And dimensions that are lost
To the worlds we know as real
Feel the bile churning away
Mold the substance
To send through the gate
Cosmic seas of fire traverse the void of space
Bringing human souls from another world
Manipulate the species from inside
Watch them fight and kill
To build the megacemetery urns of the planet
In this lachrymose universe
Of anfractuous dimensions
No death as known
Only doorways
They return back to kill the living
They return back to take this Earth
They return back to take their own world
Now you can see the ancient magick
Now you can see the ancient gods
Now you can see the ancient spirits
Now you can see the ancient gods
When we closed them in the abyss
They said We'll return back
And now they are in front of men
Now they want to take their land
When I look around my life
I see damned souls they don't survive
I see young people they always cry
They have no values don't know the light
In your eyes
Tears of lies
You cry and die
Tears of lies
When I look into your face
I see depression I see no faith
I see young people they always cry
They have no values don't know the light
Rituals magick
I enjoy me with every excess
To free my soul to free my heart
To free my mind of shit
And I know that I will die
I'm waiting to see the end
If you know what is the light
You have no fear of death
I enjoy my life
Yes I know that I will die
And I never cry
But I know that I will die
Die die
Yes I know that I will die
Rituals magick
I prepare me to my return
I prepare my soul I prepare my heart
I prepare me to cry no more
You that try to take
All the stupid men
You would like to put
Your hatred in myself
You don't need a God
You don't need a men
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else
Prince of darkness
You're nothing in my life
Hey prince I know your name
I don't fear all that you say
You like to see the death
You like to see all black
You like to see
The decline of men
You think that I don't know
That you rule this world
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else
I would like to know
What reality is
I would like to know
What life is for me
'cause I spent all my life
Running behind my dreams
And every time
I ran behind my faith
I ran behind my faith
Sometimes you need someone near of you
Sometimes you need solitude
You can find yourself and you don't need no one
You can find your faith and you can walk alone
I try to know myself
I try with every excess
I try to fall into a trance
I invoke the spirits of dead
When I invoke my spirit guide
I feel his power inside my veins
I feel his knowledge into my brain
And I keep it inside of me behind my faith
Do you believe in a living dead
Do you believe in the other side
Do you believe that we return back
Do you believe that we cannot die
So look at the cemetery
And tell me what you see
In the graves there is nobody
But believe me this is real
The graves are open
The graves are open now
And now we are returning back
To show you what's the life
There is no end with the death
The beginning is in the other side
I don't know where is the knowledge
I want to know where's my conscience
So I look at my heart
And I find all the answers
It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul
I want to know the mean of life
I want to know where's the light
So I look at my soul
And I understand what I am
It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul occultum lapidem
I'm not blind and I can see
The great light of my will
I look for peace for my mind
I look for pleasures that I've inside
I that live my spiritual tale
I don't want toopen your eyes
I just want to show you these lies
They try to use your faith and your mind
Stolen faith stolen faith
They say Give us your money and pray
They say You must believe in our faith
I say Give us a reason to pray
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
Resent me
Sworn enemy of the weakened heart
Cursing the miracle
Leech of the sun
Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way
Wage the war
Madness awakes and reveals its face
Truly immeasurable
Hidden in all
Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn
Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way
Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn
Nazarene
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
We're born to reign as masters
To ashes we'll burn the pastures
Repell their ways back to nothingness
Chaos in symmetry
This glorious victory
In darkness only we can see
Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn
Transcend with rage of the elite
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside
Defiled bloodlines severed
The lowlife's doom endeavoured
The sheep of masses trampled under our march
Set out to lead and create
This power indulge our fate
This era calls for annihilation
Our whispers outsound prayers
We claimwhat was never theirs
Sworn to the triumph of darkness
Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn
Transcend with rage of the elite
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside
Down insects bow to me
Die insects too blind to see
Down disgusting foul flea
Die we remove the life of thee
Foul prayers rise
Staring through the eye of the chasm
Still at rest but breathing
Enemy be born
Grant us knowledge of the opposition
Spew forth from the earth
So sworn
Hibernation draws to a close
Lacerating wings unfold
Hunger will cease
Abominations speak from the dark
Now seek only death
Antichrist
Rise before us
Pain
From inside
Release them
Souls in slavery
Come my saviour now
Face is the one of a reptile
Rotting teeth and lips
Speaking words of sick salvation
Whispering eclipse
Antichrist
Rise before us
Pain
From inside
Release them
Souls in slavery
Come my saviour now
Cast into the lake of fire
Gagged by blood
A thousand deaths unwind
Storming
Perseverance is none
Repenting not
Mass decay of life
Swarming
Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praise
Trapped inside a burning field
Sheep of god
Followers who did not heed
The warning
Unblessing of the purity
Once the norm
Darkness holds the blasphemy
Swarming
Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praise
Insanity will reign supreme
Azazel
Belial
Abaddon
Leviathan
Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
At Kellys' I saw the girls slimming
Bringing in tampons drenched in vodka
Then the party started to rocka'
I was sexually aroused
By these naked girls
Inserting their compacted
Tubular shaped pieces of cotton
Into their vaginas and anuses
Yeah
The strings hanging out of their labia
Getting piss drunk
All these fish tacos dripping alcohol
Thought I was in heaven
They were bending over
Showing me their brown eyes
Moisty wet and surely succulent
And I could choose any any slice
So I got out my hard implement
Slimming party at Kellys'
I pushed it hard Up to their bellies
Slimming party at Kellys'
My dick accompanied me in endless rallies
Slimming at Kellys'
Think this trend is a good thing
Slimming at Kellys'
Hell of a night full of swingUp on the hill
looking down at me
The hoards are waiting
for the guilty to be
Sentenced to death
Blood sport
feel the thrill of the chaise
Heart is fit to bursting
at the deadly pace
Hard to draw breath
I am the prey
it's jungle law
Fight to survive
tooth fang and claw
Wild dogs behind
see snarling jaws
Running man
breaking free
The hounds of hell
are after me
The gibbet waits
or to take my head
Will I make it
Or will I be dead
I'm the running man
I'm the running man
I am yeah
Running man
I'm the running man
Understand
In for the kill
sprint for the line
Can't break my will
race against time
Life flashing by
Hunted the pack
are closing in
I hear them howling
Maybe I can't win
but I've gotta try
I swore an oath
dragged to the floor
My ghost will haunt
this windy moor
Forever free
through blood and gore
Running man
breaking free
The hounds of hell
are after me
The gibbet waits
or to take my head
Will I make it
Or will I be dead
Nobody helped me
nobody even knows my name
Fighting bravely
even though I died in vain
Whoa
Running man
breaking free
The hounds of hell
are after me
The gibbet waits
or to take my head
Will I make it
Or will I be dead
I'm running still
On this cold and lonely
wiley windy hill
The seer has a message
it spells out a warning
Foretold of evil
from times early dawning
Lilith is her name
she'll drive you insane
From hell spawn she came
to find you
She tells you damnation
is nothing to fear
Proclaims revelations
is already here
Black are her eyes
beguiling with lies
With blood lust she cries
let the night games begin
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Daughter of darkness
banished from Eden
She is the succubus
lays down with demons
Lucifer's child
restless and wild
A harlot defiled
blind fool
Queen of seduction
bewitching the priests
Lust and corruption
the mark of the beast
Haunting your dreams
insidious schemes
She laughs at your screams
the nightmare won't end
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
She'll take you to the alter
like a human sacrifice
Easy virtue incarnate
she's a mistress of the night
Priestess of seduction
she's all your body needs
Eat you alive
fuck you till you bleed
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Roll on up take a look at me
just a sideact novelty
Circus clown in the public gaze
nameless horror to be
feared and caged
Behind this mask of deformity
there's a son of humanity
Formed by natures twisted hand
they call me monster
But I'm a man
Everything I touch
everything I see
Everything I feel
crumbles before me
I am not a dog
I do all I can
Can't you understand
Wanna fit in with the likes of you
Set me free
let me go
Want to belong
I need to grow
But you treat me like a
freak show
Freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show
Freak show
Mirror your insecurity
imperfect scarred
just leave me be
Need a place where I can hide
no one sees the wretch inside
Stripped of pride and dignity
mocked by cruel society
Thought you were my only friend
now I can see you just pretend
Everything I knew
everything I crave
Everything I do
brings me closer to my grave
Too grotesque to live
but too young to die
Madness cruelty reigns
torment clouds my brain
Hatredwhy is it so
Need to belong
someone you should know
But you treat me like a freak show
Freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show
Freak show
What do you want from me
Cut me do I not bleed
I'm every bit as good as you
Out castbeat down betrayed
Lost in a world I never made
I'm insane after all they put me through
Set me free
Let me go
Want to belong
I need to grow
Oh they can't even look me
Right in the face
Subhuman
Let me show you
the creature I've become
The evil that torments the soul
when prejudice is done
Freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show
Freak show
Freak

You treat me like a freak show

I'm nothing but a Freak show

Too bad the boy can't sing

Sweet meat

In the back of a hand
You'll go far It's true

In the charts on the news

at the end of the day
Looses heart
playing one night stands
Never got a deal

He was good

It ain't what you do
it's who you know
That's the catch 22
when the doors are closed

It's a fashion reaction
Pigeon hole philosophy

Gonna sell 'em the illusion

long way
Foundations of rock

Prime time honey
Never pay no heed to those
who oppose my lifestyle
Feel no remorse for the wrong
that I've done
I constantly abuse all who try
to use me
Like a fallen angel banished
from the sun
Cause I'm the Night Stalker
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attack
Prowling these streets at night
I fight a deadly game of survival
Stealing through the concrete
jungle with bloodlust in my
brain
All here fear me I'm ruthless
as I'm godless
A preadtor of the side walk in
his alleyway domain
Cause I'm the Night Stalker
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attack
Society brands me a homicidal
madman but they cannot
cage what they cannot see
When I'm coming you as
good as a dead man
Ain't no one alive that can
elude me
Cause I'm the Night Stalker
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
The only sound I hear is my tired heartbeat
Sometimes I feel just like a motherless child
This place once had a name
The people once had faces
Sometimes I feel just like a countryless man
The county correct me from my wild ways
I once saw figures about a mile off
So I waited in the woods until they were gone
Sometimes I feel just like a wandering dog
The county correct me from my wild ways
Struck down by a vision of beauty
Said I was struck down by a long legged archer
Oh the city was hot but my blood ran cold
Oh the city went dark keep calm and carry on
I was a young man only 19 years old
I was a young man so very far away from home
I want to be an old man damn you von Braun
I've been laid low by a blinding light
I've been torn asunder by the banshee's wail
I was a young man only 19 years old
I was imprisoned by a vision of beauty
I was struck down by the long legged archer
Suited for telescoping the interstellar scene
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts
Anthrax ham radio and liquor
What if I told you they been lying
About that double wide with water rights
And now the town cars are back again
They sold you some old line
About the greater good and sacrifice
Your friends from Langley are back again
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts
Anthrax ham radio and liquor
Coming at you live
It's just some people can only see the stars
In the reflection from big black cars
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts
Oh Abraham Lincoln carried across the street
Oh Abraham Lincoln carried across the street
The assassin the coward
shot him in the head
The assassin the serpent
Struck him then he fled
Snickering drunkards from cover of dark
Treachery's their master
murder is their heart
From the table rips his chair
Cross the people on the stairs
Watch the limbs running for
All across a empty bar
Oh Abraham Lincoln buried him in his grave
Oh Abraham Lincoln buried him in his grave
The assassin the coward no grave for you
The assassin the actor no applause for you
From the table rips his chair
Cross the people on the stairs
Watch the limbs running for
All across a empty bar
In a city of crooked alleys
Crookeder women and wicked men
Dim lamps in the rumor mill
Suspicious kith and unkind kin
Haruspectre General
Sleeping soldiers in the field
Below the elders conspire
To turn the merciless and massive wheel
Locked in among skeletons
Broken hearted and damned
Sorry to have to break it to you friend
But life seldom goes exactly as we plan
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them
The city's always thriving
Hungry bellows of the Minotaur
Everyday more are arriving
And everyday it requires more
Unexpected circumstance
We must not delay
You have all been so very very kind to us
And we will return the favor one day
Fate is the idiot's excuse
Freedom is the sucker's dream
But we hope you find some measure of comfort
In considering us to be your family
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them
In the raining park the chessmen play
The faithful atheists refuse to pray
The steamworks weep the addicts do not care
Crowd of cold people stand by and stare
The garbage eaters their many retainers
Come to collect all the foul remainders
The smoke hangs heavy the wrecking ball swings
In the clockwork of a collapsing thing
The hourglass is turning
On a shore of iron cutters and clippers
Paper rock rock paper and scissors
On a road of skulls their story moves on
It's a bumpy ride and very very very long
In the blue sky the seagulls fly over garbage
Are we the ocean Are we the desert
Are we the garbage Who's to say
I'm gonna move to the outskirts of town
Where none of your friends are hanging around
Where none of your business is hanging around
I'm gonna build a castle out of Goodyear tires
Gonna dig a mote Fill it up with ale
What kind of ugly are they talking about
It's just straight up cold evil
What kind of nonsense are they going on about
Do they suffer from the fever
Nothing's gonna satisfy them
Till it all goes Chernobyl
No nothing's ever really gonna satisfy them
Until the virus goes mobile
If you didn't then well now you know
Outside is an army of antlers
I hate to say it but I told you so
Only the freaks have all the answers
Red threat Helicopters SuperMindControl
Stockholm Syndrome Love your captors
Uranium SuperMindControl
It's gonna rain rain down in buckets
Watch it happen a natural fact
They're gonna lose and their not gonna like it
Watch it happen Supernatural act
I send pictures through the mail
Well documented and very detailed
To politicians and big celebrities
But none of them are believing in me
And I await their response
Some send none most send cops
But man it's a dire situation
And I will risk the public humiliation
Sleestak lightning on my trail
It's a dire situation they are on my trail
West Virginia has its Moth Man
Pan handlers' got their Skunk Ape
But I have a tazer and night vision goggles
Costco rolls of black duct tape
It's got red eyes it's got razor claws
It's got green skin no it ain't a methhead
All roads lead me to selfdestruct
Veins are maps paving way to the abyss
Up is down and from this there is no escape
Drown down and out
Gates without keys eyes without holes
Life without answers a corpse with no soul
My race to the grave is my birth given duty
My race to the grave is my birthright
My inborn malignance manifests failure complete
I know I'll never leave this shitball alive
This name dies with me
This depravity this futility
It's synonymous with family
Fuck you forever and fuck me
I deny both idols and hope
I reject this holy hoax
At the end of my noose
Fuck the son long live the beast
A vendetta for revenge and bloodlust to die
My advice Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death
Who would call this shitball home
Who wouldn't be best served
By feasting at the funeral knell
Who hungers not for decay
My advice Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death
The preaching of psalms denied
Extinguish the light it shines no more
Of servitude and supplication
Bring on nuclear winter
Feast
Drown in silence and servitude
Requiems for the lifeless
Damnation and downfall
The two gifts of life
Feast
Extinguish the light it shines no more
Bring an end to this curse
Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed
The power of mercy is now extinct
Blackgloved hands knives to throats
These are the new messiahs
Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed
Putrid breath of life how I hate you
You burn all you touch with gifts dual
Of misery and awakening
A rotting sentence that walks and kneels
All that prays kneels and dies
Arms outstretched on bended knee
All that walks kneels prays and dies
Tongues of ice tongues of fire
All shall burn in the funeral pyre
Arms outstretched pray and die
We exhalt
Let us hold hands united in the great uncoming
Of that which is perfect
We bow great bringer of night
Choronzon's dawn we embrace you
Offer forth the benevolent
Tentacle of futility
Whispers of obliteration echoing nigh
Bring down the summer of finality
We huff your rot now come forth
And carry us home
Bear benevolent gifts of decimation
Our congregation of the end
Welcomes you
Forever and never of ways
And impossible
Great breaker of worlds
To thee great king
Let us be your vessels
For the great uncoming
Always and impossible
Great destroyer of life
We huff your rot
The tragedy of the excommunicated
Forever and ever always impossible
Soliloquies written in blood
As we were all born so shall
we die alone
Baptised in scars crowned in agony
Conceived with the futile notion of the self
could ever ascend
Rip the skies asunder to draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
Shower mortals with the remains of their kin
There is nothing left worth saving
And even less worth dying for
The ultimate blessing is silent sleep
Forever as it was once foretold
Rip the skies asunder and draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
Dog eats dog eats man eats self
The packing order of the leprous
Fundaments of failure embodied in man
Begotten signs of faith drop lifeless
Under the velvet of no promised tomorrow
Rip the skies asunder draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
O great lord shower us with shit and piss
O great lord give meaning to this outrage
O great lord bear the vestige of the atom
O great lord in glory Annihilus
O great lord let me consume your suffering
O great lord I inhale your pestilence
O great lord shower us with your death
O great lord
We are all but blood on Satan's claws
Rain down plague to wash down famine
Bathe us in the waters of death
Shower us with fire eternal
The cleansing when all became none
Congregate flagellate
We the downtroden beg you
Correct this most grave of mistakes creation
We who exhalt in the end worship it
We beg for baptism in blood in sinew
Snuff us out
Burden us not with the disease of tomorrow
Wrap us instead with black wings of sorrow
No prayers sent up to an empty sky
Sink for fangs deeper into our necks
We who exhalt in the end worship it
Baptise us all with blood
Baptise us with humanity's eulogy
The end when all became none
In case of rapture the car might be unmanned
But the gun tower won't be
Send us back to the vapor of the ether
Rain down plague
When all became nonewe were born without eyes 
and the sockets were just break proof safes 
read these books and diaries 
that's how they said we could start clean 
then pray on knees that judge and blame
If I could better myself I swear I would
I swear to god I'd fucking change myself 
My veins are turning a dark blue
I feel like dying how about you
Take the coins out from under your tongue
Drown drown I'd fucking drown without you
If I said you were the only one
who could pull me out of this one
would you think it was fiction
I don't remember the good ones from the bad 
But it's too late because 
I can't hold back from the bucket of bruises
Drink the youth
Drink the youth
The stomach holds heavy circulations 
Our scariest secrets and pleasures
Fuck us front to back
We could build a city in a single day 
but in a couple of seconds we would try 
to bury our regrets
So grab my chest and slip your fingers
because its all about to end
They said we might not come back from this one
but who fuckin' cares
at least it will make us into humans
Shape my legs until they walk on order
shape my eyes so they wont tear up on command
because its worth more than your breath
So what if your teeth hold a grudge
so what if your grinning means nothing 
I bit my own hand clearly right off
The cursed no one can change us
The spells no one can take us 
I'm tired of your breaking downs
The heavies hearts can keep from breaking down
churning grinding itself into slumber
A plague on both your plans
Burn the quakers 
learn
don't catch fire
burn
What's that father father
It wasn't gravity it was the witches
Make your fingers into pillars 
hold all the stomachs in this town 
they can't stomach anymore 
The wood on these trees smell like skin now 
and old fires are full of carpenter stories
It wasn't gravity it was the witches 
The last time we spoke we ended up no where
and it seems like my words
aren't any better than your quotes 
our speeches were reversed
just like the movements of our hands 
with every sentence I became more afraid
because through this mirror
I thought my words would come out backwards
Ridin' on two wheels
Chains hooked on my heels
Sittin' in leather
Ridin' on steel
Put my shades on
Hair blows in the wind
I give some square the finger
Now he won't look again no he won't

Now you were sittin' home
And I got sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job

Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling

On into the night
Pull along side
If you're looking for a fight yeah 
My social workers
Got me on a chain

Unemployment checks
Run out next week

'Til I'm back on the streets again

Now you were sittin' home
And I was sent to Nam
I went to the big house
You just worked a job

Hear me calling
Can't you hear my death tone
Hear me calling

Death tone

Gonna ride on my death tone
Yes I am

I hear the sound
In a metal way
I feel the power
Rolling off the stage
Cause only one thing
Really sets me free
Heavy Metal
Loud as it can be
Baby I was born to play music
I'm a man with a screamin guitar
There's a light in the middle of the stage
In a minute I'll be wearing it all
I don't know another way of living
Baby I don't really care
Give me a pair of jeans
And a riff that's mean
And girls that love to share

Heavy metal metal daze
Heavy metal heavy metal daze
Heavy metal heavy metal daze
Living like there's no tomorrow
Yeah Currie says we're on the edge
He says man you're really graphic
This band a social wedge

And if I don't hear the sound of metal
I go into shock

Heavy metal metal daze

Mama's having problems

Old enough for a trip around the world
Pick you up on Friday

My Uncle Sam sent a letter said
He's got a mission for me
Now I'm a ranger not a stranger
And I live in Saigon
We've got a team of special forces
And we deliver napalm
But if they tell you that I've lost my mind
Baby it's not gone just a little hard to find
By the time this letter gets home
I'd be gone gone yeah gone
And if they tell you that I'm MIA
Think a little less about me each day
'Cause if I ever get back
I'll be shell shocked whoa
Shell shocked yeah
Feels funny riding in my car
Used to drive a tank and shoot a BAR
I know I'm home
But I feel gone gone yeah gone
Now it's over and the homeland's safe
Got a purple heart to show the world I'm brave
The businessmen sat at home
Well I got shell shocked whoa
Shell shocked whoa

We met on English ground
In a backstage room
We heard the sound
And we all knew
What we had to do
We called the high command
Requested leave to make a stand
And in the field we grew
And we all knew
Soon the time would come
For us to fight
Destination
Now in sight
Aaah Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Our fight will never end
So we call on partisans
To raise your hands
And take our stand
Look sharp
When duty calls
Where we march
Cities fall
And the strong survive
And take our side
Now the time has come
For us to fight
Target waiting
In our sight
Aaah Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Manowar
Born to live forever more
Manowar
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore
Hold your ground and give no more
Born to live forever more
The right to conquer every shore

He broke the laws of the elders
So they plucked out his eye
Took his land and fortune
Left him to die
Bound on the shoreline
Left for the tide
Sees his lifeblood leaving
Circling lower the vultures fly
His bones may be broken
But the spirit can't die
And the Gods see his anguish
And give him a sign
From the floor of the ocean
The ship of the lost souls rise
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry
And in the world above
The elders sing
On his land they live
Let death's bell ring
He was met at the gate of Hades
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls
The Keeper of the Unavenged
And He did say to him
Let ye not pass Abaddon
Return to the world
From whence you came
And seek payment
Not only for thine own anguish
But to vindicate the souls
Of the Unavenged
And they placed in his hands
A sword
Made for him
Called Vengeance
Forged in brimstone
And tempered
By the woeful tears of the unavenged
And to carry him up on his journey
Back to the upper world
They brought forth
Their Demon horse
Called Black Death
A grim steed
So fiersome in might
And black in colour
That he could stand as one with the darkness
Save from his burning eyes
of crimson fire
And on that night
They rode up from Hell
The pounding of his hooves
Did clap like thunder

Burning death destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
No one can escape me
On Black Death I ride
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance
Your head lays there by your side
I take the lives of all that I once knew
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you

Burning death destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
I spare not land or servants
My wake is smoke and flame
I take their wives and daughters
They stand there watching watching
Hoping to gain their lives

Burning death destruction
Raping the daughters and wives
In blood I take my payment
In full with their lives
With their lives
With their lives
With their lives
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousands side by side
With swords drawn held high
Our whips and armour shine
Hail to thee our infantry
Still brave beyond the grave
All have sworn the eternal vow
The time to strike is now

Kill kill Oh 
Kill kill Oh 
Kill kill Oh 
Kill kill Oh 
Gone are the days when freedom shone
Now blood and steel meet bone
In the light of the battle's way
The sands of time will shake
How proud our soldiers stand
With mace and chain in hand
Sound the charge into glory ride
Over the top of the vanguished pride

Victory victory Oh 
Victory victory Oh 
Victory victory Oh 
Victory victory Oh 
To the battle we ride
We crossed a starlit sky
No space no time
We'll catch the wind
Strange losses men died
We crossed a starlit sky
And still no space or time
We'll catch the wind

Kill kill Oh 
Kill kill Oh 
Kill kill Oh 
Kill kill Oh 
Sound of charge into glory ride
Over the top of the anguished pride
By moonlight we ride
Ten thousand side by side

Kill kill Oh 
Kill kill Oh 
Kill kill Oh 
Kill kill Oh

Black is the forest white was the snow
There as children how could children know
One without name or number soon would show
There stood he on his chariot made of gold
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring
A shield of gold the Creator and king
And the great sword of steel
Sons of destiny shall wield
Hear Wisdom's voice
Rise know the strength that you feel
Hold in your heart but never reveal
Guard well the secret of steel
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring
A shield of gold the Creator and king
And the great sword of steel
Sons of destiny shall wield
Hear Wisdom's voice
Rise know the strength that you feel
Hold in your heart but never reveal
Guard well the secret of steel
Hear the pounding army of the night
The call of metal summons us tonight
And gather we on this site
To behold the power and the might
Off with the lights hear the screams
See the banging heads awaken to their dreams
The sound of metal so loud it cracks the beams
Played by warriors called the Metal Kings
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call
We are together we are all
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand
Hands high forever we'll be there
Gloves of Metal rule tonight Yea
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call
We are together we are all
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand
Hands high forever we'll be there
Gloves of Metal rule tonight Yea

Into the darkness march the armies of the night
Bound by metal we live the fight
With hands high fists fill the air
Against the world we stand
Hands high forever we'll be there
Gloves of Metal rule tonight Yea
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand
All those who stand on shore
Raise high your hands to bid a last
farewell to the Viking land
Death's chilling wind blows through my hair
I'm now immortal I am there
I take my place by Odin's side
Eternal army in the sky
I point my hatchet to the wind
I guard the gates and all within
Hear my sword sing as I ride across the sky
Sworn by the sacred blood of Odin onward ride
Valhalla the gods await me
Open wide thy gates embrace me
Great hall of the battle slain
With sword in hand
Behold the kingdom of the kings
Books of spells and magic rings
Endless knowledge endless time
I scream the final battle cry
I taste your blood as it showers from my blade
I eat your heart from evil it was made
I take your powers to the ancient ones who reign
I conquer evil let evil know my name
Come forth ye wicked know the gruesome pain
I am the omen the one that cannot die
I am the flame hatred burns inside
I crush your bones I kill your face
I rip your flesh I end the chase
You meet with terror you draw the ace
I rule the world the rats that race
HATRED
Above the wreckage of your mortal world I stand
Judgement passed delivered by his hand
Now clear the smoke there the ashes stand
A fitting tribute to mortality and man
What was written foretold in dreams
in visions apocalypse now seen
Drink the wine of his anger
Die with the beast
Vindication he is coming on the clouds
See his angels hear their trumpets sound
Know the end is coming heed this sign
By the morning star the four horsemen ride
Revelation the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon the first trumpet blows
Hail fire and blood fall on Satan's throne
Seven stars of seven cities in his hand
Know the end is coming heed this sign
By the morning star he four horsemen ride
Revelation the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon the first trumpet blows
Hail fire and blood fall on Satan's throne
Revelation the chosen saved
Earth be cleansed in a blaze
Armageddon the first trumpet blows
Hail fire and blood fall on Satan's throne
Ride Ride Ride Ride Up From Hell
Armed with magic sons of demons and men
Black winds blow where we ride near
Maim and kill them take the women and children
Hot pitch and chain take to the air
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare
Steel meets steel axes broadsword and shield
Maim and kill them take the women and children
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side
I fear this wound your last
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood
And I remember days long past
Your sacrifice so great rest now take thy sleep
For you shall not awake let revenge be sweet
For when we march your sword rides with me
For when we march your sword rides with me
For when we march your sword rides with me
For when we march your sword rides with me
This be your last hour Let your steel be tried
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane
Kill me if you can
Death is life
By the full moon they rise from their graves
Swear the creed of unity by the circle of blood
Maim and kill them take the women and children
Three sons have I and they

AH
Slowly crossing as the river runs below
Never stopping for whats waiting soon will slow
And this last time looking back I'll see
My home for he awaits me reaching for my
soulHe calls my nameand waves me on
The fallen one he stands in flame
Well the life that he has given full of riches
And success has a price that I made good in
Blood to payAnd the light he now is showing
To guide my every footstep is insurance if
I falter on my wayAnd what God has now
Forsaken and man has never seen are the
Riches of the underworld below all my
Years of earthly pleasures gave support
Unto the briges I now cross it giving
Him my soul
Dark LordI summon thee demanging the
Sucred right to burn in hellride up to hells
hot windFace one more evilthan thoutake
My lustful soul
Drink my blood as I drink yoursimpale me on
the horns of death
Praise Satan
I know the one who waits satan is
His nameis across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
I know the one who waits satan is
His nameis across the bridge of
Death there he stands in flame
He is my provider as I walk into the
Void for eternity I give to him my soul
I shall do his bidding obey him
Without question even walk among the living if
I'm told
Satan don't forsake me I wait for
You take me grant me wings and as
You messenger I'll fly
I made a rocknroll sin
They said Why be proud don't play so loud
Be like us and get a sound that's real thin
And buy small gear
You won't get robbed
Hey hey hey can you hear me say
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again
My fingers fly
That's won't stop until the day you die
Oh it's music to my ears when they scream
You won't get robbed
Hey hey hey can you hear me say
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again
You won't get robbed
Hey hey hey can you hear me say
All men play on ten never gonna turn down again

Hear the call of the wild in us all
It waits for the night to fall

No holdin' back let's ball

And leave you in the morning feeling right
I'm an animal there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free

Gonna set it free
I've been looking you've been watching the side
There's somethings you just can't hide

Your hairs standing up on end
Your skin is screaming glad we met
Tonight's one night you won't forget
I'm an animal there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
I'm an animal there's an animal in me
Gonna set it free
Black clouds on the horizon
Great thunder and burning rain
I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
Thor the mighty Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
God of thunder God of rain
Earth shaker who feels no pain
The powerhead of the universe
Now send your never ending curse
I watched as he shouted
To the giants that died that day
Thor the mighty Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Swing your hammer to crack the sky
Lift your cape so that you might fly
Back to Odin and gods on high
And leave this mortal world
Thor the mighty Thor the brave
Crush the infidels in your way
By your hammer let none be saved
Live to die on that final day
Gods monsters and men
We'll die together in the end
Odin
So tall silent against the sky
Up through the clouds where eagles fly
Wind and rain beat down on one so strong
They cut but never change what stood so long
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you it's all inside
Just climb
I'm in the ground I'm in the air I'm all
I live in the hearts of all men
I'm the call to greatness
Not all can hear
I awaken the creator in those who dare
And the day will come when we all must die
And enter the mountainside
Life's for the taking
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you it's all inside
Just climb
I have no fear
Death and glory
Both draw near
Like a man is a mountainside
Greatness waits for those who try
None can teach you it's all inside
Just climb
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Called by the gods and given a sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer it's my time
Pounding pounding we are back from the dead
Those who denied us are delivered instead
Into the hands of four sworn to ride
Now the people will triumph and live by the sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Sign of the hammer it's my time
Black is the wind on the heels of the gifted
Called by the gods and given a sign
Onward pounding into glory ride
Sign of the hammer be my guide
Final warning all stand aside
Old man and young boys it's my time
Sign of the hammer it's my time

For only courage and heroism linger after death

The north star always guides me
When winter skies are gray
And I wait for the sun when all ate one
I shall not betray
Calling at me
I'm waiting when all are led astray
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone

We were born to fly
Comin' at us no stopping
Born to amplify
Carry On my sons forever
Carry On when I am gone
Carry On for when the day is long

Civilization crumblin' fast
End the world with a blast
People afraid walkin' the streets
Scums have their day
'Til they run into me
Are you ready 
Livin' in fear ain't livin to me
I'm armed with a gun defending the free
They blew it in 'Nam
Shot up my friends
I'm back in the street
The fight never ends
I was born with a gun in my hand
I'll die for my country
But I'll die like a man
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Now that we're back to animal law
The payback's a bitch
I'm paying all
All my life I been waitin' to see
Who's gonna win crumbs or me
Are you ready 
My brother's still in DaNang
Puttin' an ad in the back of Kerrang
I'm lookin' for people who just wanna kill
We'll go back to 'Nam 'cause no one else win
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Now that's how it is
And that's how it stays
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
Violence and Bloodshed
When you are old enough to read these words
Their meaning will unfold
These words are all that's left
And though we've never met my only son
I hope you know
That I would have been there to watch you grow
But my call was heard and I did go
Now your mission lies ahead of you
As it did my so long ago
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you
And to defend them to the end
Defender
Ride like the wind
Fight proud my son
You're the defender
God has sent
Fatherfatherfather
I look up to you and heed thy call
This letter ends my search
I'll live your dream now passed on to me
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate
Like the dusk awaiting dawn
So wizards cast your spell
With no heart to do me well
So it is written it shall be
Defender
Ride like the wind
Fight proud my son
You're the defender
God has sent
I have seen the fire
Of the thousands suns pass by
While blasphemers spread their Gospel
Bearing false witness
Now we rise
All ye children of the wild
Fists like hammers fill the air
Vast legions all immortal
Smash the stillness everywhere
Holy Holy War
Holy
We are fighting fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Holy War
Baptized in Fire and Steel
Holy War
For the end we bring is soon
Holy War
Now face the storm
A Holy War
Brothers of metal know no masters
Metal's our religion
Take it to the grave
Rulers of the earth
Our dawn of glory
All reborn we live again
Hold true ye sacred army
Our last battle is at hand
Sweep this dogs from our kingdom
Bless this ground our holy land
Holy Holy War
Holy
We are fighting fighting a Holy War
Holy War
See us fly on winds of doom
Holy War
Baptized in Fire and Steel
Holy War
For the end we bring is soon
Holy War
Now face the storm
A Holy War
Full moon's light is calling me
My kingdom lies within
The mystic soul and lion's heart
Brought by the talisman
The ecstasy of battle takes me
Where the falcons fly
Immortal youth was granted me
I will never die
Born of Black Wind Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind Fire and Steel
Pounded by the hammers
Of the giants of the world
I can see in darkness
I'm the overlord
Single combat I await
My shadow brings them fear
The spikes upon my chariot
Will grind them when they're near
Born of Black Wind Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind Fire and Steel
I am an outcast
On the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side
Born of Black Wind Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind Fire and Steel
I am an outcast
On the path of no return
Punisher and swordsman
I was born to burn
Black Wind always follows
Where my black horse rides
Fire's in my soul
Steel is on my side
Born of Black Wind Fire and Steel
Born of Black Wind Fire and Steel
Born to teach them all to heel
Black Wind Fire and Steel
Since the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Snipping in the dust
Long before your birth
Eatin'tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes my machines's tripleplated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast faster faster faster
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood is nitroglycerin
I'm fire
Burning burning burning burning
Ready to explode
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke
Tires screaming
Fire in my hair
blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast burn burning faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Manowar Manowar living on the road
When we're in town speakers explode
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill
We like it hard we like it fast
We got the biggest amps man they blast
True metal people wanna rock not pose
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
Other bands play Manowar kill
Other bands play Manowar kill
We're the kings of metal comin' to town
When we light up have the roof nailed down
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud
They wanna keep us down
But they can't last
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass
Gonna keep on burnin'
We always will
other bands play Manowar kill
I ride a comet
My trail is long to stay
Silence is a heavy stone
I fight the world and take all they can give
There are times my heart hangs low
Born to walk against the wind
Born to hear my name
No matter where I stand I'm alone
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
say what you feel
Born with a heart of steel
Burn the bridge behind you
Leave no retreat
There's only one way home
Those who laugh and crowd the path
And cut each other's throats
Will fall like melting snow
They'll watch us rise with fire in our eyes
They'll bow their heads
Their hearts will hang low
Then we'll laugh and they will kneel
And know this heart of steel was
Too hard to break
Too hard to hold
Stand and fight
Live by your heart
Always one more try
I'm not afraid to die
Stand and fight
Say what you feel
born with a heart of steel
From a battle I've come
To a battle I ride
Blazing up to the sky
Chains of fate
Hold a fiery stride
I'll see you again when I die
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the Kingdom Of Steel
High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Providence brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride
See the white light
The light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice that speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Feel the white light
The light within
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom Come
Words of power
Calling to us all
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom Come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall
Kingdom Come
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead together we will ride
Like thunder from the sky
Hold your hammers high
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
As I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill
Hail Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill
My father was a wolf
I'm a kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
I will bring salvation punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill
Hail Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill
Rip their flesh
Burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants
Burn their homes
Till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and Kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right hail and kill
Hail Hail Hail Hail and Kill Hail and Kill
 Grandfather tell me a story 
 Alright go and get your storybook
 No no not one of those a real story 
 A real story 
 Yes tell me about when you were a boy
 Well then I shall have to take you back
with me a long way in time
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's
day as I walked through the enchanted forest
I heard the sound of horses and men at arms
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place
of these sounds and when the forest did clear
I was standing on a hill Before me there
was a great plain Upon it the armies of the
world standing waiting I thought to myself
for whom or for what are they waiting 
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the north
There appeared a lone rider holding a sword
of steel Then from the south came another
bearing a battle ax From the east came a third
a rider who wielded a great hammer of war
With them came their soldiers of death followed
but the look in their eyes told all who beheld
them that they would leave this day only in
My heart began to pound storm clouds filled
the sky with darkness rain came and the four
winds blew with such anger that I held fast to
a tree I watched the four riders raise their
weapons into the air Without warning screaming
their war cry They led the attack down to
the battle they rode They met the armies of
the world with a mighty clash  I could feel
the ground shake the earth drank much blood
that day  Each of the four was unto himself
a whirlwind of doom 
When the smoke did clear many thousands
were dead There was much blood and gore
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across
the battlefield like brown leaves blown by
the wind And I saw the four ride together
to the top of the hill while below them the
soldiers of death assembled all those who
would now swear allegiance to them And the
four spoke the words of the warriors prayer
Gods of war I call You My sword is by my side
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death if I should ever fail
Glory Majesty Unity
Hail Hail Hail
And as I stood and looked on I heard the
armies of the world hail them without end and
their voices of victory carried long and far
throughout the land 
 Well that's it Did you like the story 
 Yeah it was great 
 Oh Good I'm glad Now off to bed with you
 Grandfather 
 Yes 
 Who were those four men 
Brothers the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the Battle Hymns
Into Glory Ride
Hail to England
The sign of the hammer's our guide
Forever we're Fighting the World
Side by side

She Is Waiting To Kiss My Hand

My Chains And Collar Brought Her To Her Knees
She Now Is Free To Please
Woman Be My Slave
That's Your Reason To Live

I see my chariot run to your ships
I'll drive you back to the sea
You came here for gold
The wall will not hold
This day was promised to me
The gods are my shield
My fate has been sealed
Lightning and javelins fly
Soon many will fall
We are storming the wall
Stones fall snow from the sky
We will pay with our glory
In the fire of battle
Zeus today is mine
Killing all my way
Like sheep and like cattle
Smashing skulls of all who defy
I spare not the hammer
I spare not the sword
This day will ring with my name
None have to chase me
Let he who will face me
Kill me or die by the sword
Oh friend of mine how to say goodbye
This was your time but the armor you wore
Was mine I will not rest
Until Hector's blood is spilled
His bones will all be broken
Dragged across the field
This dear friend is how we'll say goodbye
Until we meet in the sky
From this day do I abstain to a memory of hate
To pay for all the blood that spilled
The many thousands I did kill
No walls can contain the gods' almighty will
I hear the silent voices I cannot hide
The gods leaves no choices so we all must die
Oh Achilles let thy arrows fly
Into the wind where eagles cross the sky
Today my mortal blood will mix with sand
It was foretold I will die by thy hand
Into Hades my soul descend
Cowards in the grip of fear no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth with honor long been sold
For all shall come to know me
As they fall unto their knees
Zeus the Thunderer control my destiny
When the cards of life were dealt
My hand a ruthless fate
To cut the cord of life and beath
Ties to earth unfasten
Kill
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield
His body lies on the battlefield
His body's mangled wounds
Coward in the grip of fear no valour to uphold
Cut into the earth with honor long been sold
Zeus the Thunderer control my destiny
Die die die
The oath of the gods this day was fulfilled
In the heat of the battle Hector was killed
See him Patroclus down in the dust
Rejoice in his death my symbol of trust
A dozen highborn youths have been killed
Their bodies set at the fool of your fire
With oxen sheep and two of your hounds
Your funeral pyre high off the ground
Hector's body dragged three times around
I will carry the torch to your funeral pyre
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire
A prophecy spoken a promice fulfilled
More blood will be spilled more will be killed
Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
Got to make it louder all men play on ten
If you're not into metal you are not my friend
Leave the hall
Now the world must listen to our decree
Got to make it louder all men play on ten
If you're not into metal you are not my friend
If you ain't got the balls to take it you can
Leave the hall
Racing to the battle in the sky
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
I am invisible I move without a sound
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
We must die to be reborn
I wear a sacred talisman I make a secret sign
Now welcome me into this wicked wind
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride
The gates of hell are open Let me in
All Commandments and the laws of man disown
Into the fire with your soul
We must die to be reborn
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die
I am invisible I move without a sound
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground
We must die to be reborn
The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee
Some of us were taken by boat and died at sea
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery
Paint ourselves for war now blood and fire burn
Great Spirit makes us strong take us to the sky
The Cherokee are brave we are not afraid to die
Strong and brave warriors to the grave
Hatchets sing with pride let the white men die
We have come from the ashes of the burning away
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain
Led into temptation now the black gods align
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time
By their anger and fury the strong will survive
glory and a broken sword
Born inside the soul of the world
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone
Eternal might I was born to wield
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought
Great heroes charge into the fight
I laugh at my fate
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled 
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
The clash of honor calls
I will stand when others fall
Open magic doors
The will know the power of my sword
With blood in my voice I scream as you die
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain
Shaking the forest onto the plain
I laugh at my fate
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled 
Gods of war feel the power of my sword
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire
Hell's wind and incantations summon living fire
In darkness and destruction behold the evil eye
And the Demon's whip
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Night winds Oblivion see my dark desire
Come forth appear he is living fire
Feel the Demon's whip
To heal the unrepentant one needs a greater sin
Feel the Demon's whip
I live inside a dream calling to your spirit
As a sail calls the wind hear the angels sing
Far beyond the sun across the western sky
Reach into the blackness find a silver line
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night
Close your eyes look into the dream
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring
There the road begins where another one will end
All to be the master of the wind
Falling stars now light my way
My life was written on the wind
Clouds above clouds below
High ascend the dreams within
And there will be the road to all our dreams
Nothing is as bad as it seems
Close your eyes look into the dream
Wins of change will winds of fortune bring
There the road begins where another one will end
All to be the master of the wind
Now the time has come when all is said and done
We're back together on the road it's time to fly
No more time to wait you know it feels so great
Wearin leather on a horse of steel I ride
Kiss my ass if you don't like me I don't care
We're all crazy gonna ride until we die
Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We're here to burn up the night
Losers try to put us down it's just another day
I got no money or big house just got life
I don't like to save it's more fun to spend
If you like metal you're my friend
Don't try to understand me my family never will
Had to punch my teacher out now he's chilled
I might stay in school or die in prison
And I'm just fine
Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddamn lifes
We're here to burn up the night
We're here tonight to kick some goddamn ass
Livin hard and ridin fast
Time to burn you losers better learn
No one controls our goddam lifes
We're here to burn up the night
Strike while the iron is hot
Steel is strongest so say we all
They tried to test our spirit
They tasted steel before we were done
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past
All blown away like a shot from a gun
We cast our lot together four still stand as one
Here we'll remain forever till our kindgdoms one
Brothers of metal
We are fighting with power and steel
Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall
And we will die for metal metal heals my son

Fighting for metal that's all that's real
Brothers of metal will always be there
Standing together with hands in the air
In the beginning there was silence and darkness
All across the earth
Then came the wind and a hole in the sky
Thunder and lightning came crashing down
Hit the earth and split the ground
Fire burned high in the sky
From down below fire melted the stone
The ground shook and started to pound
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
We are the true believers
It's our turn to show the world
In the fire of heavy metal we were burned
But the enemies of metal we can't forgive
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
We believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight
They have chosen us and we have heard the call
Gonna tear the roof off with our sound
Crack the walls and shake the ground
Fight tonight for metal one and all
Cause we believe in the power and the might
And the gods who made metal are with us tonight
They said to play it louder than Hell
We promised that we would
Hear this song of courage long into the night
Hear this song of courage long into the night
Hear this song of courage ride into the night
They are won by those who find the heart
Find a heart to share
Hear this song of courage long into the night
Hear this song of courage ride into the night
We belong to the world we belong to the wind
We are the spirit of the competition's end
The heart and soul of discipline my friends
We are sending you a challenge it's very clear
We came to win that is why we are here
Demanding to be tested tested by the best
Not to be forgotten like all the rest

I'm a stranger in town and my guns never cold
I'm a gambler so bet on your life
You'll never live to grow old
I deal in lead I won't step aside
Where trouble's waitin well so am I
I live for the fight the thrill of the kill
Paid in gold for the blood I spill
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
Live by the gun or die by the law
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Shot through the heart in the blink of an eye
Buried up on boot hill
Life is cheap when the bounty is high
So be ready to kill
The law of the West was the law of the gun
Shoot and be fast live on the run
Stay alive be fast on the draw
live by the gun or die by the law
Shot of whisky I'll be on my way
Back in the saddle pull on the reins
Spurs to the beast over the hill
Another town one more kill
Outlaw outlaw outlaw ride
Into the West a gun by your side
Hell and glory honor and pride
A gun will decide where the outlaws ride
Now is the time to reach for the sky
Gather the wind hear the voice to fly
To know why they sing about heroes and kings
Who were brave and not afraid to die
Look and you'll see that a new day will bring
For all who believe wait a crown a ring
The power of the man who would be king
The power of the man who would be king
Into the fight of hopes and dreams
They want us all to live like books upon a shelf
Fight for the crown fight for the ring
We're fighting the world we fight for the king
Time to face the world let brothers never fight
Forever forge ahead and keep the dream in sight
For those who never try they are sure to fail
For the glory of the king we fight to stay alive
Fight for the crown fight for the ring
We're fighting the world we fight for the king
For the crown and the ring
The power of the man who would be king
Fight for the crown fight for the ring
We're fighting the world we fight for the king
We fought to stay together
Fight for the crown fight for the ring
We're fighting the world we fight for the king
I've got the power to fly into the wind
The power to be free to die and live again
This power's like fire fire loves to burn
Make the world a grave of ashes in an urn
Walk among the living free of wrong and right
The power of the magic the power of the spell
Power the power the power
This power's greater than love and of hate
This is the power of will and of fate
The power to kill the power to feel
The power of blood the triumph of steel
Greater that the power of a priest or a sinner
The power to defy to fight and be the winner
The power of the demons spirits I command
Always by my side to serve the master's plan
Power the power the power
None can fight the power none can fight the wind
Call out to the power of the darkness and light
Piss upon their graves then cast a final spell
Fly into the night and one day meet in Hell
Power the power the power
When they see us they will run for their lives
To the end they will pay for their lies
So long did we wait now we are home
Here once again there's a battle to fight
Gather together for the sound and the might
So long did we wait now we are home
Kill all of them their blood is our seal
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead
Fight altogether as one for the right
To be free once again  tonight we will win
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes
You came here for metal to fight and to die
Defenders of steel now we are home
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory
Armed with a heart of steel
I swear by the brothers who stand before me
To no man shall I kneel
Their blood is upon my steel

There's a sound heard across the land
It's heard across the sea
And one day hope to be free
They fought for you and me
Those memories will always live inside us
And now it's our time to be free

Where the eagles fly  I will soon be there
If you want to  come along with me my friend
Say the words and you'll be free
From the mountains to the sea
We'll fight for freedom again
Scream out loud for all the world to hear
From sea to shining sea 
Let freedom ring and every man be king
To live as one through the years

Now is the time we all must stand together
So raise your hands show them we are strong
Side by side the fight goes on forever
Marching to the battle with this song

I surrender my soul
Odin hear my call
One day I'll sit beside your throne
In Valhalla's great hall
Like so many before me
I'll die with honor and pride
The right of the warrior
Forever to fight by your side
Send a sign raise the sail
Wave a last goodbye
Destiny is calling
Immortality be mine
Call the witch to cast the runes
Weave a magic spell
We who die in battle are born
Not for heaven not for hell

We are sons of Odin
The fire we burn inside
Is the legacy of warrior kings
Who reign above in the sky

I will lead the charge
My sword into the wind
Sons of Odin fight
To die and live again
Viking ships cross the sea
In cold wind and rain
Sail into the black of night
Magic stars our guiding light
Today the blood of battle
Upon my weapons will never dry
Many I'll send into the ground
Laughing as they die

Place my body on a ship
And burn it on the sea
Let my spirit rise
Valkiries carry me
Take me to Valhalla
Where my brothers wait for me
Fires burn into the sky
My spirit will never die
Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away look away look away Dixie land
Oh I wish I was in Dixie away away
In Dixie land I'll take my stand
To live and die in Dixie
Dixie land where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away look away look away Dixie land
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
Glory glory hallelujah
This truth is marching on
So hush little baby don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
All my trials Lord will soon be over
Glory glory hallelujah
This truth is marching on
This truth is marching on
Waiting in a line to hear the battle cry
All are gathered here victory is near
We alone are fighting for metal that is true
Stand and fight together beneath the battle sky

We're warriors warriors of the world
We're warriors warriors of the world
Many stand against us but they will never win
We said we would return and here we are again

All who stand in my way will die by steel
We're warriors warriors of the world
Time to know the pain no time to run within
Your ashes will be cast into the wind
Not one of you will be left alive
By the hammer of Thor you now shall die

Tonight we strike there is thunder in the sky
Together we'll fight some of us will die
But they'll always remember that we made a stand
And many will die by my hand
High atop the mountain with hammers in the wind
Lusting for blood and death again
Body and soul to come within
I will hunt you down and tear you limb from limb
Nothing shall remain not your memory your name
It will be as though you never ever lived
Blood and thunder mix with rain
Into the kingdom of darkness again
Lightning flash and body in flame
All shall kneel at the sound of my name
My path is set I live with no regret
I'm sworn to kill never to forget

No road back I never will return
Into the fire of hell I will burn
And die die die into the house of death
And die die die into the fire of hell
Army of the heavens my army waits in hell
I will not go onto my death alone
Seven gates to pass until I reach my home

Into the darkness I command my soul
Never shall I repent never shall I be saved
I go into the house of death
Before my last breath my enemies all shall die
Die die die into the house of death
Die die die into the fire of hell
When they come I'll be ready
I hear their voices inside
The stars in the heavens are moving
Soon they will align
Thor god of thunder
Let me die with a sword in my hand
Raise your hands swords in the wind
Brothers of metal together again
With blood in our voices we ride
Gods of thunder fire and rain
Cut into the earth till none shall remain
Sons of demons I command you to fly
Ride on from hell into the sky
We'll fight until we die
Voices of Victory
All Shout and proclaim
The Kingdom of Glory is mine
The Raise of the will our prophecy filled
I'm the lord of the day and the night
I've nothing to sell but the power of hell
My Armies of fire awaits
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made
My payment can never be late

Crack the Earth Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
My Enemies rise and look to the skies
They Pray I will never appear
The Life has no meaning
Awake they are dreaming
They live in a castle of fear
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

Crack the Earth Gods of Thunder
Man and beast will be torn asunder
Into the Fight I own the right
To be the King of kings
All the days of his live
He walked without fear
All who's lives he touched
Were made better for knowing him
As he returned goodness with good
As my sword is my soul
Then let all who stand before me know
I bring a storm and Magic wind
The Kingdom of the Kings
I summon the demons that live in the wind
As my Chariot drives in the Storm
With the hot blood of Battle
I wait in my saddle
I live and I'll die by the sword

King of kings
King of kings
King of
Of Kings
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die
He is descended from giants His father Loki
God of fire is the sworn blood brother to
Odin himself He rides across land sea and air
From the land of the living to the land of
The dead This eight legged steed crosses eight
Points of the compass from eight directions
Into eight dimensions He is bringer of the
Valiant dead from the battlefield to Valhalla
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
He was born of giants
His icy coat is grey
At night he rides into the world of death
The living by day
One day on his back I shall ride
From the battlefield into the sky
Borne by Valkyries we valiant dead
Into the hall of heroes shall be led
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
Faster then the fastest horse alive
The living son of fire rides
From the halls of across the sky
To the world of gods and men
Eight legs and magic runes
Carved upon his teeth
Thunder and lightning
Sound beneath his feet
On his back the war god Odin rides
Sword and magic spear held high
Ride down from Asgard
To the battlefield
Bringer of the valiant dead
Who died but never yielded
Carry we who die in battle
Over land and sea
Across the rainbow bridge to Valhalla
Odin's waiting for me
The son of giants
Walks across the sky
To the gods a friend
Fathered beast and men
As a falcon he did fly
Far across the sky
To take back the hammer
Of Thor his friend
He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men
He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he
To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
He lives between the worlds
The world of gods and men
He is the god of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
Brother to Thor
And Odin god of war
Loki god of fire
Reigns for evermore
The father of a wolf
And the serpent of the sea
The ruler of hell
A giant is he
To Odin he's a brother
A brother who is sly
One who changes shape
Who walks across the sky
God of fire
Burning higher
God of fire
Into the sky
When the world turns you away
A friend will not say no
There is strength that we all have
It's not the strength we show
And in your darkest hour
In your darkest nights
Whatever life will do
I am here for you
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Though we're far away
The stars above are the same
And when you feel alone
There's one who shares your pain
A true friend has no price
There is none to pay
I remember you stood by me
I'm with you all the way
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me know in your heart
On one you can always depend
I am thy friend
Think of me wherever you are
When it seems like you're reaching the end
Call on me know in your heart
One who will always defend
I am thy friend
He is the god of poetry sorcery and death
Here to the blaze
I wander
Through this black night

The edge of our mighty swords
Did clash
Fallen by our axes
Helmets smash
Glory and fame
Blood is our name
Souls full of thunder
Hearts of steel
Killers of men
Of warriors friend
Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
To the end
One day too

Scorch the land
Glory and fame

Soul full of thunder
Hearts of steel

Sworn to avenge our fallen brothers
Sons of the gods today we shall die

With a bold mighty hail
Cover me with death
If I should ever fail
Glory majesty unity
Hail Hail Hail
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom

Father on bended knee
I ask thee
Raise thy hand
We the sons of Odin
Await thy command
Born under the sign
Of the hammer we stand
And here we all may die
Our blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal
We are gods of war
Immortal

Odin here the fallen wait
To join thee by thy side
Let Valhalla's gates open wide
Born under the sign
Of the hammer they lived
And here they fought and died
Their blood on the ground
The battle horns sound
Let thy Valkyries fly
Down from the sky
Into the fight
Hearts full of rage
Full of thunder and glory
Swords in the wind
Crossing the sky
Lords of doom
Bring an end to their story
Today is the day
We die in the fight
None shall remain
To pass one more night
Now Valhalla's calling us
Immortal

Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with heroes
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die
In the hall of the slain
Valkyries and heroes attend me
Ravens and wolves at my side
Forever they did befriend me
I paid an eye for a drink of mead
And was given wisdom supreme
Granted to me the secrets
Of magic of life and death
Ah Speared hung upside down
Nine days and nights no food nor mead
The will to be a sacrifice
Of myself unto myself
Wisdom and rhyme
Sorcery death living inside me
Of life and death I am king
For both do I bring by sword and spear and ring
Raise thy weapons on this day
Ye shall not die alone
Fight and die let Valkyries fly
For they shall take thee home
I promise thee that on this night
Ye shall be by my side
Asgard's halls await with hero's
Brothers that have died
For thee we wait at Asgard's gates
Come join us by our side
Valhalla waits so choose thy fate
For all of us must die
A hero was he
Touching all our lives
As if he lived and died
In a single moment
Great were his deeds
All his words were true
He lived and died
A man of honor
He paid with his life
For his life was the price
To pass the gates immortal
Thy journey begins
With sword in the wind
Stay thy hand rest thy command
For Odin's call was heard above them all
Thy name shall never die
Long shall we remember
He who walked the road of danger
Master of revenge
Death's no stranger
Blood and death lived on his sword
The god of war his only lord
Into the depths of hell
Go all he fell
Take thy shield take thy sword
All thy weapons to the sky
Ye shall need them when Odin bid thee rise
For none but the brave
Shall rise up from the grave
To see the Valkyries fly
And so it was by the hand of Odin
Did the immortal warrior pass through
The gates of Valhalla and into legend
Rise brother rise pass Valhalla's gates
Here great warriors await
Reborn from thy steel
All thy wounds be healed
From the earth to the sky
Now the son of Odin rise
Take thy place among the kings
For thy soul shall never die
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We will die
Quit my job this morning said forever
I would hold my head up high
Cause I need metal in my life
Just like an eagle needs to fly
So I walked outside into the street
From a hall I heard thunder and screams
I walked inside so I could hear
And the guy beside me gave me a beer
He had his fist up in the air
And called me brother said my friends
Are over there
They call themselves immortals
They're the truest of the true
And in that very moment
I was born again like you
They said hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die
Brothers stand beside me there's a battle on
Know my words are true
There's a battle for true metal
They're marching they're marching on
Me and you
Ten thousand strong are here tonight
With twenty thousand fists up in the air
The power of true metal's calling you
It's everywhere
Hold your head up high
Raise your fist up in the air
Play metal louder than hell
Louder than hell
They can't stop us
Let 'em try
For heavy metal
We would die
YOU'D HAVE TO BRING A SWARM OF KILLER BEES

THIS AIN'T NO CARAMEL
YOU'RE LISTENING TO THE MOTHERFUCKING HELL
Sightless sentinel of the sprawling void
Uncoiling black reflections
So slow the tides of the abyss
Megaliths of the unfathomable geometry loom high
Formless towers in the unreverberate darkness
Gaping fissures in the landscape yawn around me
Stones crumble to dust and fall to the depths
I am envenomed by the salt of the earth
Fragments of a brittle carapace
Fingernails hair and ashburied bones
Subaural waves of the thunderous vibration
Tremor throughout the audient void
Infinite black integuements slither slowly
The titanic inertia of vast sprawling planes
A drop of rain into the churning sea
Dissolution into the yawning tides
I will forget what it is to be
And not knowing I will rise again only to fall
I am the inheritor of disease
Of damp black earth
My withered husk will dry upon the shore
I will become the sand
Here to choose the weakest of our race
Hellhounds with the devil's own face
Our faith in order was a mistake
So fearful and divine and devoid of grace
They try to run but there's no escape
And the light decayed on that final day
Fear crept up inside
Night became something more than a trade
Death calling in the wind This is the end
I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky
It was like a call from the other side
What will you do now
The fires of hell are raining down
Deep inside you're starting to shake
And slowly losing ground
Everyone is dead  Your bravery is useless
Your bravery is useless
I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky
It was like a call from the other side
And there I cried out of control and paralyzed
As everything I once was died
There's no way I'd be dying honorably
If they came and took my life now
There's no way I'd be dying honorably
Regrets in tow they didn't even stand a chance
So hear me final lines have been drawn
To build again to fall again
It's warn me down to the last straw
Test me now test me
I don't feel human at all
These days have got me feeling like a god
Hear me final lines have been drawn
To build again to fall again
It's warn me down to the last straw
And I held on so long to my home
Until a tempest came
She came in and swept it away

Where's your bravery
What will bravery do for you now
You make your way but don't belong
I swear you're not the only one
Is that what you've been dreaming
Is that what you've been dreaming
There's other ways of staying strong
Than keeping out the other ones
I feel the light years in between
What you say and what you mean
I hear you speak
But nothing is said
You'll be stranded on the other side
Endless nights upon endless nights
Endless nights upon endless nights
You'll be alone
Alone to the grave
There's a place in all of us same in everyone
Making right the balances in all of us
Aching and burning and growing and learning
And building the world around us
Still you can't hear me
Call out your name and try to get through
I never hear back never hear back
My words became a thousand arrows
Slicing through the endless barricades
So that everyone on earth could hear my call
And I watched for you
You're putting me on
All those around you draw to a quiet
Your eyes dart across the room
But it's just an illusion
The room doesn't exist it's only you and I
And it's almost like we can't fail at all
Or maybe we've failed already
What you choose to see is real
A cold dark world of enemies
Obstacles you can never overcome
Or a bright future ahead
Strip the shackles off let me look at you
I'll have to rethink all that I thought I knew
Call out your name and try to get through
I never hear back never hear back
From you

Tap the primal circuit
The current lets you know you're alive
Make this crushing power ceaseless
You could capture the world
When embracing the electric kingdom
Know that it could all come crashing down
With unseen surges coming closer
I fight to defend my denied throne
I took selected analysis
That day I never felt more addicted
Barely surviving the shock
Soon I found myself in a cruel revolving door
You said failure I said you're turning to
Cruel sources
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources
They've set you on fire
Change up the trend for the hell of it
Then you'll see I never did support it
Carving away at the block
You said savior I said you're turning to
An electric current fuels the lust again
Like a feral god
I've stepped far outside the lines
But I feel no shame
I stole the scales and I cleared my name
Now try
Try to pry them from my dead hands
Now try
Try to pry them from my dead hands
Cruel sources
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from you
Slaving for my solace of mind
Careless to the state I'm in
I've so long been alone
I've so long been alone
I can't go on
Rain down rain down
Cleanse my soul flow like a river
Forging insight by pagan torchlight
In cadence warlike
We draw tears from the sky
Because the well's run dry
Rain down rain down
Cleanse my soul flow like a river
I've spread out my seed
It's gone in all directions
It starts to feel like
The promiseland is a fantasy
And heaven has been swallowed by the desert
In a draught without submission
Not a cloud in the sky
This course keeps getting harder
The more I try
I dig up dry bones
And the corpses cry as they open their eyes
To see the world's decay
This world's a tomb
There's a clamor in my heart and it's over
Where is my prize
It's over
Where is my prize
My promised prize
Forging insight by pagan torchlight
In cadence warlike
We draw tears from the sky
Rain down rain down
Cleanse my soul flow like a river
Look at me now
I'm losing control
I don't know what to call myself
I know that I'm sick of playing a role
All along I've been kidding myself
Seeking out a set reality
What does that mean
Clearly nothing Clearly nothing
Though it may seem
That means I'm OK and everything's OK
All along
I've been kidding myself
Life is falling apart at the seams
thought patterns
Over and over time and again
Over and over time and again
I think I've got it all worked out
Then I forget every conclusion drawn
Every epiphany gone
I felt safe
Then the walls come crashing
in one day
Without warning
Everything that I thought was stable
Deep in me starts to wash away
Can you feel it
It's the motion of the tide
Watch yourself now
There's an ocean deep inside
You could drown in it
Look at me now
I'm losing control
Changing my shape I slide through the doorway
Can you feel it
It's the motion of the tide
Watch yourself now
There's an ocean deep inside
You could drown in it
Watch yourself now
There is no ocean deeper than this
Watch yourself
It's an endless journey through the abyss
All along I've been kidding myself
Working equations
Everything I was in constant change
I'm not the same
I'm not the same
To hit the mark
To bring the rain
To take a climb
The path to fame
I sat dreaming a lone
Then it came out of nowhere
An all too familiar voice with a false face
The voice of the jealous
It's less than encouraging
Walls have been closing in
Though in droves the masses came
Years from now they'll say
From the way out from the way out
Fools rushing over the hills
There to watch him fall
There to watch him fall
Endurance endurance it came to me
And now nothing can stop me or keep me in line
Get out of the way as I take to the sky
It's hard to discern all the motives I see
And forgotten their dreams
I'll still be all that I am
I am more than a clown for you
Hear me and know it to be true
From the way out from the way out
Fools rushing over the hills
There to watch him fall
There to watch him fall
Until you're ready to break
Until you're ready to bend
Critical condition critical
The years will wear down every brick you lay
There's more to life than selling your days
Money makes sense in the world today they say
I'm not living that way
Setting off setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own
I won't be a product on the industry line
You stand for nothing or you stand alone
Leave it to us to cross the final line
Can you feel the dawning of our time
Take a moment to turn and see the signs
Can you feel the dawning of our time
Time to wake up and turn the light on
Come on turn the light on
Setting off setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own
I won't be a product on the industry line
You stand for nothing or you stand alone
Pitiful
Doing what you're told
In turn
They granted you power
In a condescending tone
You stand on the watchtower
Here in our last hour
And say that you know
Typical
Of those that will never see
Say that you know
Typical
Of those that will never be free
Just like that
Took our strongest years
In the name of greed
Just like that
And made commercials out of our broken dreams
Empower the rights that they can't take away
Raise your voices
Echoes of the spirit
Echoes of the spirit
Resounding in tones that set you free
Shout with me
We are awake
Setting off setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own
I won't be a product on the industry line
You stand for nothing or you stand alone
We're in critical condition critical condition
You've come to save the world
What do you believe
What do you believe
So you've been chosen
By your eyes
By your hands
By the choices that you call your own
And price that you would sell your own soul
Pay the toll
Carry your
Carry your last test of flesh and bone
We make exchanges as the story unfolds
You've come to save the world
What do you believe
What do you believe
Who are you  What have you become
A charming illusion a source of confusion
Another day you'll win the race
A charming illusion a source of confusion
Who are you  What have you become
A charming illusion a source of confusion
Another day you'll find your place
A charming illusion a source of confusion
Another rise to power
No matter who or when
And we will know of our freedom
Never again never again
A common thread of distance
In the hearts of men
And we'll have love for our brother
Never again never again
We are all the victims of a will to overcome
How far we've gone out of  touch
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war
Can't justify it
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war
To erase away
All that we've become
They can't see we're all one
A voice cries from underneath
You're weakened by comfort
Action
Reaction
Like an eye for an eye from our tribal days
The lesser ones demand reaction
Dare to challenge the one universal law
Set you up to fall
Do you understand now
Why your days are numbered
Do you understand
The course of events were a riddle
A pause in time
A search for the solution as we stood in line
Honored our oppressors and paid our fines
It is ours
Doomed to repeat our history
No time to question how when or why
We simply come together or die
To a system of capitalist politicians
False face of a greater power
Your empire will fall
Bringing about the end of an era
Warmongers
Your bloodlust to conquer
Turns the moments of our lives
Into a ticking timebomb of your own creation
Counting down the days
Rot in your graves
How far we've gone out of touch
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war
Can't justify it
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war
To erase away
All that we've become
To erase away
All that we love
There's no right side of war
Now that we've reached the end
And I'm the only one surviving
I'm just waiting for the morning light
To touch my skin
Warm my heart
But I see a dead world at sunrise
A dead world at sunrise
And nothing can reverse the state
Who now will pray
And save my soul
When hell ascends
And calls my name
I'm alone
And so forth and so on
Their faces left
I'm longing for death
I'm in torture
Torture
It's all that's left of my memories
The cold hard truth
Bitter and sweet
Though I can't touch them see them
They are there silent
They listen
Silent though they listen
But I see a dead world at sunrise
A dead world at sunrise
And nothing can reverse the state
We are still one
and I'm missing pieces of myself
Of myself of myself
Here to choose the weakest of our race
Hellhounds with the devil's own face
Our faith in order was a mistake
So fearful and divine and devoid of grace
They try to run but there's no escape
And the light decayed on that final day
Fear crept up inside
Night became something more than a trade
Death calling in the wind This is the end
I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky
It was like a call from the other side
What will you do now
The fires of hell are raining down
Deep inside you're starting to shake
And slowly losing ground
Everyone is dead  Your bravery is useless
Your bravery is useless
I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky
It was like a call from the other side
And there I cried out of control and paralyzed
As everything I once was died
There's no way I'd be dying honorably
If they came and took my life now
There's no way I'd be dying honorably
Regrets in tow they didn't even stand a chance
So hear me final lines have been drawn
To build again to fall again
It's warn me down to the last straw
Test me now test me
I don't feel human at all
These days have got me feeling like a god
Hear me final lines have been drawn
To build again to fall again
It's warn me down to the last straw
And I held on so long to my home
Until a tempest came
She came in and swept it away

Where's your bravery
What will bravery do for you now
You make your way but don't belong
I swear you're not the only one
Is that what you've been dreaming
Is that what you've been dreaming
There's other ways of staying strong
Than keeping out the other ones
I feel the light years in between
What you say and what you mean
I hear you speak
But nothing is said
You'll be stranded on the other side
Endless nights upon endless nights
Endless nights upon endless nights
You'll be alone
Alone to the grave
There's a place in all of us same in everyone
Making right the balances in all of us
Aching and burning and growing and learning
And building the world around us
Still you can't hear me
Call out your name and try to get through
I never hear back never hear back
My words became a thousand arrows
Slicing through the endless barricades
So that everyone on earth could hear my call
And I watched for you
You're putting me on
All those around you draw to a quiet
Your eyes dart across the room
But it's just an illusion
The room doesn't exist it's only you and I
And it's almost like we can't fail at all
Or maybe we've failed already
What you choose to see is real
A cold dark world of enemies
Obstacles you can never overcome
Or a bright future ahead
Strip the shackles off let me look at you
I'll have to rethink all that I thought I knew
Call out your name and try to get through
I never hear back never hear back
From you

Tap the primal circuit
The current lets you know you're alive
Make this crushing power ceaseless
You could capture the world
When embracing the electric kingdom
Know that it could all come crashing down
With unseen surges coming closer
I fight to defend my denied throne
I took selected analysis
That day I never felt more addicted
Barely surviving the shock
Soon I found myself in a cruel revolving door
You said failure I said you're turning to
Cruel sources
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources
They've set you on fire
Change up the trend for the hell of it
Then you'll see I never did support it
Carving away at the block
You said savior I said you're turning to
An electric current fuels the lust again
Like a feral god
I've stepped far outside the lines
But I feel no shame
I stole the scales and I cleared my name
Now try
Try to pry them from my dead hands
Now try
Try to pry them from my dead hands
Cruel sources
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from you
Slaving for my solace of mind
Careless to the state I'm in
I've so long been alone
I've so long been alone
I can't go on
Rain down rain down
Cleanse my soul flow like a river
Forging insight by pagan torchlight
In cadence warlike
We draw tears from the sky
Because the well's run dry
Rain down rain down
Cleanse my soul flow like a river
I've spread out my seed
It's gone in all directions
It starts to feel like
The promiseland is a fantasy
And heaven has been swallowed by the desert
In a draught without submission
Not a cloud in the sky

But I see a dead world at sunrise

And nothing can reverse the state
We are still one
and I'm missing pieces of myself
Of myself of myself
The sun daubs shimmering baths for the field
everything is waiting themselves to be healed
fluids of gentle rain drops silently in pairs
The paint is to be denied by the horizon
circular zones of time rearrange on
precious daubing of the sun
switch on for another one
Daubing of the crescent travel far across
light for the hollow despair of bitter loss
the field is clothed by a thin cloak of grey
the sun and horizon will start another day
It's pale presence demands another harvest
The paint is to be denied by the horizon
circular zones of time rearrange on
precious daubing of the sun
switch on for another one
Which gracefully shows it's brilliance
transparent grey glow in it's guidance
crescent of a dying peasant
for eyes of the radiant
or what mirrored it into our imagination deeper
it meant dying
I'd rather feel the grass under me
causing pain
than touch of false moss under me
When I stalk this flat earth
rather hills would I adore
when I see false homes
homes for no wanderer to be
I'd more love the shelter of an old fir
by day under her cooling shadow by night hidden
from the star's light
When illumes the strange lights
competing with life's own
Held 'em prison I tell you
held 'em in illusions
I'd rather talk with the sun
see the young birch brought to life
and by night sleep under a free moon
When the wind turns north
brings forth the cold
I see death fleeing to death
life left alone
I'd rather smell true death
wash myself with burning leaves
and by night sleep under
Dream my precious with no fear
I'll sing my song to make you sleep
Dream about fairies dream about elves
About secrets hidden behind your eyes
Child of Aprils Sun you are
I'll hold you to keep you warm all night
Snowflakes floating
Like endlessness above I will be awake
Through this winter night I will sing
The whole world and the deepest spaces
Waiting just for you to come
Someday you will go my dear
I'll give you my voice to walk with you
Like endlessness above I will be awake
Through this winter night I will sing
From the Emptiness comes life
So full it will be
You came from nowhere
Teached me more I never knew
And I cried with you 'cause I understood
Repentance
left behind I have those sour moments
Saddled
and my journey to home started
From inner lands I left and will never return
the sea will be my home from now on
Fears from you I learned
as my journey went on
You brought me the shimmering meadows
and darkest stars at nights I travelled
You showed me bitter delights and those moments
I enjoyed
ocean waters you teached me to adore

Gods on their thrones must be laughing
In hell plotting the mass genocide
Numerous peals of thunder were heard
Deadlights burn bright in the sky
Abyssus abyssum invocate
Turbulent winds started to blow
Furious Gods whom I have not known
Will change the balance of war
In the ritual hall of Supreme Generals
The fatal countdown had begun
Column of smoke and fire arose as
Bright as 10000 suns
Oceans will boil mountains will float
Evoked by a pagan relapse
This black magick mystical weapon of
Doom will burn us without leaving ash
Deadlights illuminate the skies
Far beyond the event horizon
A desperate Reich exerts
Black Magick science
And whelped an abomination
Aeons conceived data
From a distant realm
Far beyond the Killing Horizon
To raise havoc with the Nazi Bell
A doom machine beyond imagination

I turn my eyes to Dagon
Our great god
Flat on his divine face
In the Temple of Oannis
We feel no more glory
About the battle of Aphek
What sacrifice is needed for victory
Enemies who speak in tongues of fire
Purify us in black flames
Burn oh god we burn
We bow down in shame
And whisper powerless words
Let not the ark of God of Israel be with us
For his hand is hard on us
And on Dagon our god
This blasphemy will be
Avenged upon us
Out blood will colour
The earth blood red
And it will be licked away
By the doggods
Darkness shall be upon us
For three horrible days
Pestilence and death
Creep over our land
Flocks of bugs will ruin our crops
Blistering flashes from the skies
Onslaught the enemies of Israel
We are the damned race
Cursed by the wrath of Yahweh
Our millennial resurrection
Shall be smothered in blood
We bow down in shame
I turn my eyes to Ba'al
Our great god
Powerlessly staring at the horizon
In the Temple of Created Things
We feel no more glory
About the battle of Aphek
What sacrifice is needed for victory
Those who speaks
In tongue of distemper
Purify us in black flames
The firespitting demon Azazel
Spreads his blackened wings
The earth is drenched
In the blood of Goliath
7 months of suffering
Lord Ba'al creator of our fertile earth
Majestic father and king
Of gods and men
Master of the mountains
Ruler of the rainstorms
We bow down before thy splendour
Lord Ba'alEl god of life and fertility
Intermit the continual combat
With the god Mot
Show the leech of Yahweh thy might
And slay the Hebrews
And their ravaging god
We bow down in shame
And whisper powerless words
Let not the ark of God of Israel be with us
For his hand is hard on us
And on Dagon our god
Before thine erected sacred altars
We beg
We are smitten
With divine Obamanations
Unshackle us from death and sterility
And destroy the realm
Of the circumcised
This inhuman place makes inhuman monsters

This inhuman place
Makes human monsters
Trains full of corpses love
Death and hysteria
This place shall be called
A cult of torture
A secret sect of sacred executioners
My Datsja shall be called
A house of prayer
Dissidents struck
By the lightning of the Moscovite Zeus
Bloody pen strokes
Feed the desk of mass murderers
Death of millions plotted
Under warm candlelight
This inhuman place

Trains full of corpses fear
Death and hysteria
This place shall be called

My Datsja shall be called

Dissidents struck by the lightning

Amoral ambition efficient execution
Cold witchhunting mania combed
Through from west to east
Dangerous perfection a spiritual decay
Connoisseur of funerals
Will lead the Reich astray
Violent retribution
Criminal aggression
Counter charging Soviet hordes fought
Back from the east to west
Blooddrunk red avengers
Ferocious as a dog
This inhuman place
Makes inhuman monsters
Monsters
Immured
I dreamt my memories
An empty hollowed spirit
Restless
Stirring in this Kremlin wall
And while I lie here
They defile they desecrate my tomb
They tried to blacken
Trivialise and slander
The holy name of Stalin
Dozing and slumbering in Limbo
I remember with joy those days when
My enemies fell upon me
This age knows nothing of war
To break Barbarossa
I put Mother Russia tothetorch
It is June 1941
My enemies were legion
But the red death held sway over all
The noble name of Stalin
Caused the Krauts more fear
Than the deepest battle drums
Invincible and endless
Invincible and endless
Katyusha symphonies
Brought great terror and
Death upon the doomed invaders
The Kremlin Cardinal
Served the dark will
Of the soulless Red Emperor
Behold
The Fist of Stalin
Kolyma Means Death
I did what must be done
I did not hesitate  I showed no mercy
O quam mi'sericors est
Stalin justus et pius
The dawn of the new
Red Age is imminent
I reclaim the Soviet Throne
Rivers of blood cathedrals of corpses
Kulak slaves perish
And die for the Red Monarch
The Grey Cardinal
Leaves his shadow world
The Maskirovka falls
Behold
Eternal Stalin
Hunger
Cringing at the sight flawless face dragged
Kissing my fingers
Type c and saliva bubbling
Kissing my fingers
The floor boards will never hold the same finish
The soiled ground for the sacrifice
Dispelled crippling faulty holyland
I am your martyr your stigmata
The tears turn to blood beneath my eyes
My body listens as you whisper
My fingers bend as I'm nailed to your cross
The splinters etch hearts in my back
A cast shadow over this narrow hill
Pulling my fingers from these nails
There will be no use for a second coming
First I stripped her naked
How she did kick bite and scratch
I choked her to death
And eat it
Sweet and tender her ass roasted in the oven
It took me nine days to eat her entire body
I did not fuck her
Though I could have as I wished
She died a virgin
And tissues break shows your ample wit
To get back at your bastards lust
Blue dress at a black grave
So I'll be sure to return the favor
I haven't for much but I'll ask you this
Why would you destroy your best friend
So plain and simple I need you to die
As there piling away your worthless body
Theres nothing more I'd rather see
Sending out the harmony that you're gone
You're gone
YOU'RE GONE
Watch her dying in pain and disbelief
Now you're gone now you're gone
YOU'RE GONE
I feel that I've done my part
But now it's time to stop this beating heart
How could you destroy
Your best friend
But now it's time for me to stop beating
From these bloody hills
Comes unmixed oil and water
Concentrated by abstract particles
Distilled through cross pollination
Pick up this doll and watch the girl dream
Clenching the fist raising the brow
As glass enters the vein
Justice shines in her dark eyes
As an amber sky drips a tear upon a sunset
This is seraplis dream ten crowns drop
Shade this tribulation in pastels
Silk feelings hurt
The river holds the color you describe as love
Do you remember do you recall
Oh that moment we lost it all
Everything I'd die if you choose not to fight
On and on the same old story
Another night we fall from glory
When will we ever learn
Forever and ever hear me calling you
The echoes from the past oh
Wherever whenever you should call my name
I swear I will be there don't you know
To cut the rope I am still afraid
'Cause I know nothings left to say
Because we ran I can never return
I lose my mind inside I'm craving
I turn to God he laughs he's saying
When will you ever learn
Forever and ever hear me calling you
The echoes from the past oh
Wherever whenever you should call my name
I swear I will be there don't you know
Forever and ever hear me calling you
The echoes from the past oh
Wherever whenever you should call my name
Forever and ever hear me calling you
Wherever whenever you should call my name
I swear I will be there don't you know
Come on baby 
Oh no no no no no no 
We crack it up we hit the top
We're moving through time
We're thunderous mysterious and glorious
We're born to born to born to
To raise some hell
We speed at night move out of sight
We breake the chains
Oh yeah 
Made of steel we fly
Like an eagle in sky
We are on the move
And we will prove
We're the strongest of them all
Made of steel we fly
Like an eagle in sky
United we stand
Raising our hands
Nations fall
Metal will stand tall 
We crash and burn
We hit and run
We make a stand
From the ash into the fire
See a phoenix rise
See a phoenix rise 
Made of steel we fly
Like an eagle in sky
We are on the move
And we will prove
We're the strongest of them all
Made of steel we fly
Like an eagle in sky
United we stand
Raising our hands
Nations fall
Metal will stand tall 
Yeah
We stand tall
Come on 
Made of steel we fly
Like an eagle in sky
We are on the move
And we will prove
We're the strongest of them all 
Made of steel we fly
Like an eagle in sky
United we stand
Raising our hands
Nations fall
Metal will stand tall 
Will stand tall yeah
Will stand tall
Metal will stand tall
My heart is screaming out your name

One night of passion one night of hunger
And my attraction is getting stronger
I need to feel you I need to hold you
My heart is screaming out your name

My heart is screaming out your name
Every time you're not around
You're a thought within my mind
Hold me near never fear
I'm right beside


If you can see me now
If you can hear me now
So long I will see you again
I don't know how and I don't know when
But I've seen this phase before
Ah Who knows what we leave behind
What we had is surely hard to resign
You keep me I be coming back for more
You and me go back a long long time
I know you well enough to read your mind
If you can see me now
I'm wasting my time try to get by
This is my song for you
If you can hear me now
I wait for a sign to bring back the time
This is my song for you
It's been this way before
You come and go this time I'd had to know
What goes on inside of you
It's not so hard to see
The consequences of the life that we leaved
So tell me what it means to you
Sometimes it all come's shining through
What I miss the most is talk to you
If you can see me now
I'm wasting my time try to get by
This is my song for you
If you can hear me now
I wait for a sign to bring back the time
This is my song for you
Sometimes you far away from me
Away to reach and I do believe
If you can see me now
I'm wasting my time try to get by
This is my song for you If you can see me now
If you can hear me now
This is my song for you For you
If you can see me now If you can see me now
This is my song for you
If you can hear me now
This is my song for you
If you can see me now
This is my song for you
If you can hear me now
This is my song for you
Don't say it because you must
Destroy the beautiful from love to dust
A promise like hearts of steel
Can break so easily when love's not real
We don't make much sense without it
Is this the end
It's a new evasion
A complication
We need a simplification
Temptation
A sudden transformation
Is this a massive oration
And I've become the sudden shadow in your life
You're falling away from me
I'm right in front of you still I can't reach
We don't make much sense without it
Is this the end
It's a new evasion
A complication
We need a simplification
Temptation
A sudden transformation
Is this a massive oration
And I've become the sudden shadow in your life
It's a new evasion
A complication
We need a simplification
Temptation
A sudden transformation
Is this a massive oration
And I've become the sudden shadow in your life

a champion in the ring
Then she starts to sing

Almost shining like a pearl

Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died
It's five and i'm driving home again
It's hard to believe that it's my last time
The man on the wireless cries again
It's over it's over
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died
It's late and i'm with my love alone
We drink to forget the coming storm
We love to the sound of our favourite song
Over and over
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died
It's time and we're in each other's arms
It's time but i don't think we really care
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by
Dancing with tears in my eyes
Living out a memory of a love that died

Raise up and shine a ray of light

Another day
I loose direction
Memories of yesterday they call
Keeps me feeling small
I use to feel the sweet conviction
Now I walk to crucifixion
Please won't you catch me when I fall
But I can't take the screaming anymore

You know I'm trying denying
That you don't love me anymore
You're closing all your doors
Inside I'm crying I'm fighting
To find the way back to your heart
But I break before I start
I can't give up to expectations
Now you leave your resignation
I will miss you when you're gone
I guess you can't take the screaming anymore
Remember all my kisses like before

I know I can't refuse the call
And your silent says it all
It's over
Don't leave me standing here

No won't you crucifixion
Inside I'm crying I'm fighting
To find the way back to your heart
But I break before I start
Another day
I loose direction
Memories of yesterday recall
Keeps me feeling smal
Of beast and man am I
Transformed by the full moon's shine
I'm ripping the flesh and eating the young
I am the unhuman one
All legends tell of me creating a killing spree

Hide your children and lock the doors
Soon I come on my blackened horse and scythe
Hide your daughters and shut off the lights
It's a Deathexplosion
My horse is black but not as black as my soul
Death is about to soon explode

It's a Deathexplosion  It's a deathexplosion
It's a Deathexplosion  Deathexplosion

Misanthropic  Frozen soul blaze black and cold

Sworn to Satan  Morbid minds close horrid pacts
At the Mountain  A body found in killer's park

Evil lives and death draws near
Serve blind that dreadful voice you hear
With violence horror pain and fear
To make them see the reaper clear
Shot like a dog emptied on blood
Life won't return to the silent corpse
Electrified  Stunned down and sacrificed

Feel the presence of me risen from behind death
Lazarus returned from the velvet deathzone
Lucifer rose in revenge and glory
Lazarus returned from the velvet deathzone
Lucifer rose in revenge and glory
By will I returned
In a deathblack Cadillac step on the gas
My lady at my side and a pistol in my jeans
All systems go shut off the brain
 Death on wheels speeding bastard
 Carry on screaming suicide master
 GO
I've chosen my way deathrace king
At one with my pain to get more kicks
With a motor running inside my head
This demon fever gotta get fed
All Hell is roaring under my hood
Burning so bad it almost feels good
But don't try to follow keeping the pace
You know I'll crash one of these days
 The world is on fire
 Burning up my tires
 Every skull is smiling
 I'm a devil gate rider
Ghostly and evil Cannonball Comet
Nothing can stop it you can't put it out
Harder faster so heavy it hurts
Blinding my eyes blackening my mind
 Shooting through my spine
 Shooting through my spine
 Shooting through my spine
Death is my whip in this race against time
Faster than light I fly through the night
I am the wolf in the sheep flock of thine
You can't hold me down To live is to fight
I've been down to Hell I've seen all the sights
I know I will die but there's no time to cry
I gotta go on this journey through life
 The world is on fire
 Burning up my tires
 Every skull is smiling
 I'm a devil gate rider
Pose  Pose naked with blood as your skin
Crawl  Crawl hated my expression of sin
Die die die die
Take  Take your place in my gallery and die
Feelyour breath getting stabbed away
Neveragainshall you spread your filth
How can the rest just live in silence
Led to death with 'belief' as the guiding light
Nailed on these walls are the scum of humanity
Parasites of life left for generationsto see
Feelyour lifegetting washed away
Neveragainshall you spread your filth
I am the rebel angel living like the devil
Rebel angel to the death
You cannot control me I'm so much stronger
I am the rebel angel living like the devil
Rebel angel to the death
Take it to the skyfrom below
Arise from the ashescome take your revenge
I am the saint of sinners defender of the devil
Rebel angel to the death
Horror angel till I die
And on this path of pain I stand all alone
Rebel angel to the end and to the death
Behind the door death stands tall awaiting all
This is our life of Heaven and Hell
This is our time for pleasure and pain
And the dead start to sing
When you go you go forever
When you go you go alone
When you go you won't remember
When you go you'll never leave
Awake what sleeps to be alive in a waking dream
You say Obey
Where I go I go forever
Where I go I go alone
Where I go I won't remember
Where I go I'll never leave
Death after death after death after death
You try so hard to hide to follow and fit in
My deathguides my life
No No   NO
Death after death after death after death
So when it calls for doomsday 
I'll kick back step out  I see
Nuclear warfare  burning storms of radiation
Come and take it away
So when it calls for doomsday
Nuclear warfare  burning storms of radiation
There will be peace and silence in eternity
Your prayers have finally been answered
Remember this when I'm haunting from beyond
A heartless killer in rattlesnake boots
He sold his soul to the big bad black
Now hypnotized all alone on the desert plains
Let the game begin  Let the desperate souls in
You get triple six and flash a gain of gold
'Til you die  Dead man's hand
That even death can die in a dead man's song
Alive

Yeah the saints are down

Life's so long or short should I say

But I gotta tell ya that my
My saints are down 
That my saints are down
Let me tell you why
Saints are down 
The saints are down 
Hey pretty good what do you got to say
Whose fucking life is it anyway
Don't you know anything about anybody else
You're so wrapped up in your tiny self
Oh let me tell ya
Saints are down yes they are
Your saints are down
Your saints are down
The saints are down
They're down 
And they're not coming round
Yeah they're not easily found
Buried
And they're buried in the ground
Yeah they're buried upside down
Saints are down
Saints are down
Saints are down
Saints are down
Saints are down
The saints are down
Yes they are
Yes they are well
You'll never see them again no
Your saints are down
My hands around your neck
Crushing the life from within your soul
As a thought crosses my mind
Who is alive
Murderer my dark angel of God
Make me suffer in my eternal Hell
I will say goodbye to my pride
Your eyes turn from blue to gray
Like the stale cold winter sky
Murderer my dark angel of God
Make me suffer in my eternal Hell
The hands of a maker your false creator
Your message in a trap
The hands of a maker
Take my inhibitions burn 'em down
Learn from decadence
Eyes turn from blue to gray from my deception
Blacken the eyes of a tyrant
Rivers bottoms take me with you
A self destructive pattern
A human God
Hey messiah Is this a game that you play
A reason for everyday brutality
Slaughter the weak
Words that stand on their own never forgotten
Tragedy hypocrisy never forgotten
A self destructive pattern
A human God
Hey messiah Is this a game that you play
A reason for everyday brutality
Slaughter the weak
Words that stand on their own never forgotten
Tragedy hypocrisy never forgotten
A self destructive pattern
Wars waged so meaningless
When does it end and peace begin
A reason for everyday brutality
Choking on the bullshit you feed yourself
A religion that promises everything
To those at will the black sheep of humanity
So you sold your soul
To the first in line
You play the role of a savior
To make yourself look better
So you sold your soul
To the first in line
Searching for a cure the plague of mankind
You play the role of a savior
To make yourself look better
In the eyes
The scars of redemption tell me who you are
Deliver relieve me
When I say the world was scarred by you
Plagiarism never lies
Resistance is futile
You play the role of a savior
To make yourself look better
In the eyes of God
From the moment at birth
Nothing has changed your just living a lie
So you bow your head deep in sorrow
In your hands open eyes
Suffer from the ignorance that you wear
I decide on your life expectancy
Dreams filled with fear
Nightmares that bury you to your knees
Every ounce of blood
Scars that never even judge me
You seem to cry
In your pathetic waste of life
Knife in hand
In my mental state
I become something more
A wall of remorse
Social obscurities nature of seclusion
I become something more
From the moment at birth
Nothing has changed your just living a lie
So you bow your head deep in sorrow
In your hands open eyes
Suffer from the ignorance that you wear
I decide as you shut down the cause
Dreams filled with fear
Nightmares that bring you to your knees
An answer to a demise
The horror underneath this so called life
A passion for the blood of a martyr
A promise to forgive a world from sin
The plague that will forever murder man
As the coil unwinds
This time you will see my true feelings
The cell that you live in will remain
The liars forming the hollow grave
The inter sanctum of what made me
Liars forming another one down
Burn the cross so we shall live
As the coil unwinds
The meaning of the defined
As the coil unwinds
The meaning of life is defined
Say a prayer for the box life
I will become your eyes inside all this silence
Adore me as I scream
Behold the truth the coil unwinds
As the coil unwinds
I gave myself to you
Bored of the regrets further from sane
Broken down images of violence still remains
Face the son of a man in mourning
Bridges will burn
So will your lies
Bridges will burn
Your sacrifice
Take me away on your wings of lead
As we fall the pleasures become perverse
Beyond desperate eyes
As you open the gates of a life left behind
The world we'll fight and I will rise above it
I tried to remember
I've seen this far too long
My soul is riped and torn
Time will open this cage revenge
Slit the throat of those that deceive
Bleeding from the eyes do you believe
Persecute me for my sins
Destroying what you know into this abyss
Mentally controlled
A life that don't exist
Your beauty falls in line
Between broken fingers and a homicide
I possess my sin in my hands
Destroying everything you know
Live by the cross the aftermath of God
My soul is withered it's harvest time
Our hands are against our eyes
Blind from what you know
Your ignorance is bliss your mistake
Destroying everything you know
Liars they make the best of everything
The curse of one pleasures burned
The wrongfully accused backwards and abused
The reckoning carve this world
Don't inspire this abyss is true
You know no one dies we are the lifeless few
Don't back down
Inside a world of spiritual forgiveness
Shelter a place of peace
Nailed to your cross of doubt why
One stab at life you see the truth
My hands bleed for you
Open the gates of Hell
Let 'em in farewell
Tired of being like the rest in your coma
Nail to your cross of doubt why
Wash away all thy sins Christ
In a way we'll all crumble to dust
Time will open up the wounds that never heal
Cries broken down lies
Eternal suffering never forgive
The plague of ages the guilty will form true
Take my hands I bleed for you
A bid farewell to those below
A crushing force set to explode
The tears of shame the tears of regret
Bury the axe destroy and protect against lies
The horror of loosing your soul in vain
Sever the ties unbroken
Sever the ties approaching redemption
Remain in the past it's better that way
Alone in your thoughts the guilty will pay
Blinded by light a shadow will fall
The horror of loosing your soul in vain
We'll see our reflections through lies
Tell me what's this suppose to be
As our thoughts become delayed from this shame
Itâs getting late and you feel so lonely
Your buddyâs waiting in the hallway
In your room youâre going crazy
Leather pants or fishnet stockings
You say you like the band
Just right between your legs
Here once again into the night
With a stranger by your side
Juicy as a cherry nasty fairy
Dirty Dark Diane
As you roll up and reach the doorway
You look around you have no money
You want to join you know how to get in
Youâll pay the bouncer in the toilet
They call you backstage queen
Youâre just seventeen
Here once again into the night
With a stranger by your side
Juicy as a cherry nasty fairy
Dirty Dark Diane
Only likes long haired men
Sheâs a suicide girl
Tell you dirty stories dirty bullshit
Smart as a donkey
Dirty Dark Dirty Dark Diane
Talking talking you donât seem to understand
Itâs not me in my mind thereâs someone else
They control all of my thoughts and all my deeds
They can turn into reality my fears
You wonât help me
Itâs not your aim
Not in this place
Canât you see how theyâre getting strong
You donât believe schizophrenic freak
Let the show begin
Voices wonât help me
Itâs not your aim
Not in this place
Canât you see how theyâre getting strong
You donât believe schizophrenic freak
Paranoid
Game playing with a melted brain
Fame how many screams for you knowledge
Gain sanity is your domain
Pray youâll never be found on the other side
As the sun kills the night
As the morning sweeps away all the tears
All my hopes fade away
I open up my eyes and hereâs my nightmare
Just another day waiting for the dark
Let me dream everyday
All my life to the end of my time
As a ghost in a cage
Our eternal embrace
A fruit so sweet to taste so long awaited
Pure ambrosia lips heaven from your eyes
The spirits from the past the envy of the gods
Cursed December days rainbow turned to grey
And I cried everyday
And I prayed for the end of my time
As a ghost in a cage
Our eternal embrace
Let me dream all my life
To the end of my time
Just at night I shall praise
Our eternal embrace
Youâre living for today
Youâre staring at the sky
Everything is fine
Youâre kissed by the moonlight
âHow this can be so wrongâ
âOur souls were made to loveâ
âTheyâll never have to knowâ
Not a pure girl anymore
Every night as I close my eye I see my heaven
As it lasts forever as Iâm falling
Everyday can you see me praying
Lost in my sorrow
I deny tomorrow feel like falling down
Lost forevermore
The streets you used to walk
It seems they want to talk
The nailed one on the cross
Heâs staring at your soul
A Shot few miles away
A mother screams in vain
Thereâs nothing more to say
Just falling on his grave
Every night as I close my eye I see my heaven
As it lasts forever as Iâm falling
Everyday can you see me praying
Lost in my sorrow
I deny tomorrow feel like falling down
Lost forevermore
Tied on the bed wish to be dead
In the club they chase their victims
Canât resist the sexy bitches
Slide on her breast âColor me blood redâ
Gruesome twosome crazy sisters
Thereâs something weird
Their minds are twisted
The fury of 2000 maniacs
Unholy twins they look so sweet
Itâs much too late theyâre closing in
Prepare yourself for the blood feast
Beware the Gore Gore Girls
You watch âem dance the sweaty chicks
You want to smell their teenage skin
A taste of blood itâs yours they need
Watch out the Gore Gore Girls
So many miles I came from the North
So many years without an answer
Canât find a place to live on my own
A shelter from the bale of living
The fire is melting the frozen ground
I moved across the edge of the world
No human being beheld these places
To find myself before the mother
Like a squirrel in the rattlesnakeâs jaws
A tale without any grace out of light
This is fortune of human kind
Fighting to live crying to survive
âWeâre just a drop in the sea of your reign
With our tears you feed your creatures
Now tell me please what nobody said
Who likes to spin this wheel of sorrow
And takes delight from your painâ
A tale without any grace out of light
This is fortune of human kind
Fighting to live crying to survive
Letâs star another journey
Weâll bring you down the depths of hell
No need to be so worried
âCause we know how to come back
So just relax and feel the power
Itâs time to bang your head
âTil youâll break your neck
Youâre waiting for the rain
Youâ lived through the sands of time
Youâre riding in the dark
This time the Bride is back
We knocked on Heavenâs doorway
But Peter came and kicked my ass
Then we went to Valhalla
But Odin said âGet out of my wayâ
No chance for us to reach Nirvana
So we went down to earth
To do what we do best
Youâre waiting for the rain
Youâ lived through the sands of time
Youâre riding in the dark
This time the Bride is back
Youâre waiting for the rain
Youâre riding in the dark
The Bride is back
Everything has a price
Dreaming here is a crime
And she knows sheâs condemned
Words she canât understand
âWash away the sin Nowâ
Stand tall as she kneels
One of themâs getting near
Dad is scared motherâs crying
The last one with his lies
âSoon you will be clean pure again
How they pretend to redeem and to preserve
Stealing the gift of our love
How can they say that your life will be again
Worthy and just to be lived
A silent cry an aching pain
Youâll realize their evil game
A tool of death a pool of blood
A farewell to the unborn
The scars so deep youâll keep inside
A lifeless womb a lonely bride
How they pretend to redeem and to preserve
Stealing the gift of our love
How can they say that your life will be again
Worthy and just to be lived
Itâs when they say âman you failedâ
This time youâve got to work much harder
Itâs when they say âjust go awayâ
Itâs time to stand and climb much higher
Expect no mercy no help âcause nobody cares
Donât let anybody else decide for yourself
The fate to walk against the wind
The will to rise above
Ride on my way to the unknown
Iâm alone again
âYou were not made to live as brutes
So keep your eyes on worth and knowledgeâ
The Greek of old on his final route
He saw the ship devoured by water
Donât be afraid to fight the gods anyway
There is no chance to be sure about the result
No chance to know if youâll come back
Itâs not a shame to burn in a tongue of fire
The fate to walk against the wind
The will to rise above
Ride on my way to the unknown
Iâm alone again
Again he fooled your heart again
And youâll never never trust any other man
Betrayed no chance to forget
Youâre tired tired to get only pain
Since then you try to hide frozen memories
Under a layer of snow
Your desperate cry is leaving you alone
Youâve lost yourself when your love was a joke
Tell me Black Widow
Again you fooled his heart again
No pain or sadness heâll find in your eyes
His tears the lies he believed
Enchanting siren heâll pay the price of pain
Since then you try to hide frozen memories
Under a layer of snow
Your desperate cry is leaving you alone
Youâve lost yourself when your love was a joke
Tell me Black Widow
Youâre living your life running from love
Making them bleed as the made before
Sailing away in a sea full of lies
Searching for peace in the heat of the night
Angel youâre wasting yourself
The shadows area taking the streets
Theyâre hiding the place where we used to meet
Thereâs no trace so sign of you now
They say youâre gone for good
But I refuse to bow down
Lost in a dream
You close to me
But Iâm all alone
Walking the streets of sorrow
Canât look back
Canât even think about tomorrow
If youâre gone
Thereâs no hope anymore
Anymore
The neon light shining too bright
Itâs hard to face the truth
Itâs so hard to face the world without you
Lost in a dream
You close to me
But Iâm all alone
Walking the streets of sorrow
Canât look back
Canât even think about tomorrow
If youâre gone
Thereâs no hope anymore
Walking the streets of sorrow
Canât look back
Canât even think about tomorrow
If youâre gone
Thereâs  no hope anymore
Anymore
Cold in my land
Whate'er the time I've been
Running too fast or walking too slow
For a long time
Tomorrow I will hate
And celebrate my greed
Wandering the waste
And tasting my heart
Smells like sour and filth
Tears don't belong to me
And no one else
I'm running to my hell
'cause none of us can make a stand
Running to my hell
Cold rain rush me into my hell
All alone when light's off
We are born to procreate
And subjugate
Tears don't belong to me
And no one else
I'm running to my hell
'cause none of us can make a stand
Running to my hell
Cold waste of a bloody
Taste we're alone
And ready to fall
Frontiers without volunteers
Who asked for a penny of love
Skyscrapers with hellish view from above
We're ready to fall
Cold soul if you're feeling old you can call
When you can't go on
Our souls are not ready for life
We're gonna have a fight
Our souls try to be swept from our bodies
Coming out to the streets
They'll complete what we did
Or what we wished to destroy
They'll mess up despite the next
Inside I'm wandering wandering
What you're doing
What you do has the logic of a soldier
And people will curse you
Blood and ruins blood and ruins
Our fragile conscience lies awaiting for a war
Inside I'm wandering wandering
What you're doing
What you do has the logic of a soldier
And people will curse you
Blood and ruins blood and ruins
Inside I'm wandering wandering
What you're doing
What you do has no meaning
Consider the fight's all around
Inside I'm wandering inside I'm wandering
The weakness of time
We'll pay for it
Distrust of the next
And fear for death
The poor and the mighty
Live in the same place that we shared
The good and the evil
The destroyed
The destroyed
Death is our freedom
Makes us equal men
Regardless of our place and birth
Regardless of our plans and deals
She'll never break her promises
She decides for us
When the wretches stand
In the wreckage
She makes us more miserable
There's no compromise
To escape our lies
They're running to nowhere
Death is our freedom
Makes us equal men
Regardless of our place and birth
Regardless of our plans and deals
She'll never break her promises
Slow decay and rest
As we're running fast
And the mighty ones are nothing
But the last ones
There's no compromise
To escape our lies
They're running to nowhere
Death if our freedom
Death is our freedom
From mortal wounds we suffer
Old men outlaw us and break rules
Decide for youth
And celebrate
The disorder the great disorder of this life
The disorder the great disorder of this life
Old inside
Cold Outside
In my hall where they can spy
And lock our minds
Me conscience's blind
And maybe it's worth to give up
And an old man came with giant steps
In the room where I lived alone
He kept his promise to destroy me
Then cut my body and ate
My heart and brain
He stole my slice of glory
Outside the door the world has gone
Suicide of youth
We celebrate
The disorder the great disorder of this life
The disorder the great disorder of this life
When you embody all the silence
That make us proud
I walk like death through your gates
And thunders light
A sound and our world is gone
It's a sound that burns lies
And weakness of might
It's a sound that goes down
With the scent of the mortal divine
It's vengeance of tears
Cleaning all of your smears
It's a promise of fear
For the rebels who live
Gone with the world without a cry
It's a crime
That we can go on
And nothing goes wrong
We're slowly down
What have we done living just like parasite
They watched my tears
And looked inside him
And slowly down
As we're collecting the remains of a tragic life
A sound and our world is gone
It's time again
To take my last minute train
And I let my hair down
In spite of my prayers
I have found something bad
And my plans now belong
To the edge of this place
And a weekend I've paid
My extreme sacrifice
For a piece of worth
I'm spending here
I'm spending here my time
I stand
And I hope to fight
Hold my hand
Hold it if I'm lost
Hold my hand
Killer what you know 'bout me
Killer what am I supposed to be
Killer what you know about me
Is what I'm wrong wrong
Killer don't be proud with me
Killer I don't feel like living
Killer what you know 'bout me
Is that I'm wrong wrong
I'm gonna give my very end to you
Cause you will be my murderer
You'll be my killer
It's like a final dance for me and you
Where if you'll get some pleasure
Well I will get it too
Killer what you know 'bout me
Killer what am I supposed to be
Killer what you know about me
Is what I'm wrong wrong
The world if miserable and fits for fools
So just take aim and pull the trigger but
Killer what you know 'bout me
Killer what am I supposed to be
Lady what you know 'bout me
Or it is better to say
Do you know what I used to be
Lonely in my world
I accept this role
And mornings and evenings crawl
Lonely in my world
I'm so scorned
To watch this light that makes me blind
Feeling or agony
Free from my world It's what I can wish
What more than I can see
I've had enough all in all it's better
When it comes to leave
A fall is a cold blow inside
That paralyze my mind
The sight is blurred and white
And all around me is dark
Feeling or agony
Free from my world It's what I can wish
What more than I can see
I've had enough all in all it's better
When it comes to leave
Lonely in my world
I accept this role
And mornings and evenings crawl
Lonely in my world
I'm so scorned
To watch this light that makes me blind
And the silence and the silence
And the silence turns you dry
Words have no meaning
When a fake broad smile
Tells my living in a rainy night and I
Feel the thorn of life
I walked a river
'Twas my tears at night
My running fast was not my last sacrifice
As the hours went by I found
Days of nothing
And loneliness will be my bride
Life is thrilling
Like motionless pieces of dolls
Days of nothing
And loneliness will be my bride
Life's a murderer
And you keep being a stranger 'round the crowd
Someone would lay the blame on somebody else
Hall is crowded
When the door is locked
I don't live here and don't forgive who you are
'cause you hurt me more than once
Someone would lay the blame on somebody else
Whoever lives with a fault inside of him
Is nothing and nothing will be changing here
Don't go straight
Take me by the hand
I stumble like a fool
And the stupid standing still
I stumble like a fool
My stomach still aching and although
I'm walking walking straight
No one can cease my prayer
Silence once again
Right on my way
You can be here beside me
Yet my innocence comes from mother earth
And I fell like I
Like I am underground
I'm so alone that I could cry
And I feel like I
Like I am underground
I'm so alone that I should cry
And I feel like I
like I am underground
I'm so alone that I should die
And I've seen this all before
It seems it's something you adore
I can't conceive your total indifference
If silence speaks a thousand words
I hear them screaming through these walls
I won't let you tear your way through me
You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out
You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out
Ohohohooo and now you want control
Ohohohooo I won't let you take hold
And I'll be there to see you crawl
But I won't catch you when you fall
Can you conceal your sense of sanity
I see right through your blatant lies
I see the truth behind your eyes
You clearly lack of all trace of humanity
You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out
You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out
Ohohohooo and now you want control
Ohohohooo I won't let you take hold
You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out
You got something you know you wanna let it out
You got something you know you wanna get it out
Ohohohooo and now you want control
Ohohohooo and now you want my soul
Frozen under a new sun
Black light shadows at play
Hold on till the end of night
Hold on till the end of night
Hold on till the edge of light
Hold on till the end of night
Hold on till the end of night
Hold on till the edge of light
I can see you
Dancing in the fire flames are geting higher
I can see you
Underneath a new sun now
Take me under a new sun
Black blood is fading away
Hold on till the end of night
Hold on till the end of night
Hold on till the edge of light
Hold on till the end of night
Hold on till the end of night
Hold on till the edge of light
I can see you
Dancing in the fire flames are geting higher
I can see you
Underneath a new sun now
My spirit breaks the caress
But I'm keeping it inside
I'm burdened by the distress
But I'm keeping it inside
It's coming back again
And my soul it wants it all
I need it now and then
I'm confused as my world beings to fall
Delirium  Desire
In oceans rages fire
Delirium  Desire
Soulless we conspire
Underneath dying lights
This semblance won't let go
Underneath darkened skies
The sun drops like a stone
Delirium  Desire
In oceans rages fire
Delirium  Desire
Soulless we conspire
Delirium  Desire
In oceans rages fire
Delirium  Desire
Soulless we conspire
I used to take you and then erase you
To see the ghost play between our eyes
This soft confession and it's slow obsession
Will hear the dove cry beneath our sighs
You crave what you kill
You stay what you will
Nothing remains without us
Will love stay the same without us
I feel I'm fading I'm drowning wading
This soulless savior has lost control
I left you needing alone and screaming
But now without you my soul is cold
You say you what you will
You crave what you kill
Nothing remains without us
Will love stay the same without us
Nothing remains without us
Will love stay the same without us
Nothing remains without us
Will love stay the same without us
I'll take all the blame without us
Nothing remains without us
Dark rain will fall
Clouds cover all
'Cos I been looking for something
I've been looking for something
And I think you need to know
I see the core of your worlds collide
I see the core of your worlds collide
And I fear
That it's all a lie
I see the sun and the earth align
I see the sun and the earth align
Day turns to night
Souls leave the sky
I think they're looking for something
I think they're looking for something
And I think you need to know
I see the core of your worlds collide
I see the core of your worlds collide
And I fear
That it's all a lie
I see the sun and the earth align
I see the sun and the earth align
And I fear
And I think you need to know
And I fear
That it's all a lie
I see the sun and the earth align
I see the sun and the earth align
On calm black waves she rides
Where the stars they always sleep
She lies on her long veils
Floating through the endless deep
And all alone she sails
As the silent river flows
She dreams of lonely worlds
As the breezes come and go
As the breezes come and go
And still she sleeps
She passes through a land
Filled with sadness filled with tears
She's sleeping through it all
As she's dreaming of the years
That came before the pain
And her getle fall from grace
The river flowers wilt
As the tears stream down her face
And I am a hollow man
See my soul its torn apart
And I need to understand
How this sadness stole her heart
I am a hollow man
See my world its torn apart
And I need to understand
How this sadness stole her heart
What came before the pain
And her gentle fall from grace
The river flowers wilt
As the tears stream down her face
And still she sleeps
Sweet dreams my love
I know the real is unreal
I am fire you always tried to steal
You're chaos naked and cold
Your seven tongues tell a lie that can't be told
You are sublime
You've taken what's mine
Now you're dancing with fury
In the sun
There's a thousand shades of you
There's a thousand shades of you
I've been scattered for days
My cold despair has now leftme slain and torn
Your benevolent gaze
You are sublime
You've taken what's mine
Now you're dancing with fury
In the sun
There's a thousand shades of you
There's a thousand shades of you
This white and aimless road
Makes all my senses overload
My soul's turning black
There's no turning back
I'm waiting on you
Times falling fast
I'm burning again
As all things collapse
It's an old an endless game
I'm the only one blame
A cold rising sun
Will leave things undone
Again and again
I'm waiting on you
Times falling fast
I'm burning again
As all things collapse
I'm desperate I'm longing I'm lost in despair
These are cracked but you're still unaware
This life line between us could soon disappear
Have we seen this all before
Don't leave me now
Behind these silent walls
Don't leave me now
There's hope still despite the despondency here
I'll rest here a while as I hold back the tears
This place is a tomb will our love rise again
The space that divide us we face and transcend
And we've seen this all before
Don't leave me now
Behind these silent walls
Don't leave me now
Save me from it all
Don't leave me now
We fly before we fall
Don't leave me now
Save me from it all
Wipe your tears away
Wipe your tears away
I've been waiting
Waiting so long
Come back to me now
Everlasting love
Always and again never taken
Soulless selfish lust always in the end
hearts are breaking
Dawn opens my eyes
Find her realize
Home is cast in stone she engraved
Unrelenting doubt
Always in the end leaves me searching
Conscience calls me out
Always and again never learning
Dawn opens my eyes
Find her realize
Home
is find on the path she has paved
Home
is cast in stone she engraved
Everlasting love
Always and again never taken
Soulless selfish lust
Always in the end hearts are breaking
Dawn opens my eyes
Find her realize
Home
is find on the path she has paved
Home
is cast in stone she engraved
Don't regret
An eternal sun
If we seek
A divine light
Forgiveness nourishes the lies
I'm returning to the soul
