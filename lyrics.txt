Let the tomb give its silent lesson
Let the dead dictate how to live
Where is the earth from  Who knows the truth 
Deaf to all voices Blind to all shining lights
It's time for you to steer for Paradise
Who can recount the universe's  creation 
Teach mankind to moralize from man
Who will explain to us where we come from 
Pay to error your debt to truth
Let the bomb give its final answer
Let us live in a void
Making progress they won't ever control
Deaf to all voices Blind to all shining lights
It's time for you to steer for Paradise
Those who solve a problem will soon discover
there are a million more questions
Who will explain to us what's our future 
Pay to ignorance your ticket to the unknown
Is it earth God's defecation
Teach science to moralize from man
Show the pagans their way to paradise
Caught in the machine where use became the law
Compelled to trust they need you
Epilogue of a fairy tale
Heartrending cries
What started this slow erosion 
The mourn of our dearest hope
An internal rain bloats my soul
After thy thought being alone
We have to learn to be independent
Burning a path everywhere we've gone
The beginning of solitude
End of all lies
What started this slow erosion 
The mourn of our dearest hope
An internal rain bloats my soul
After thy thought being alone
We decided to go different ways
We went our separate ways
Who knows if they will meet one day  One day 
Entering the last tunnel of life
As a butterfly locked in a cell of my skull
My reason's prepared to fly far away
Knocking the wings against my bones
Seeking death and my return to you
A feeling I've always awaited
From an ugly beast to this winged beauty
My reason suffers no more
Desire takes control I can feel my dead breath
Unfurling my wings spread forever
Metamorphosis from dusk to dawn
Dusk to dawn To dawn
Unfurling my wings spread forever
Metamorphosis from dusk to dawn
Dusk to dawn To dawn
Being nothing but flesh bones innards and blood
A presumed empty brain washed away with time
Outlet for conscience
Your outlet for conscience is to cry for me
My outlet for pity is to spit on your fate
My brow is deeply lined by suffering I endured
You try to understand how my body feels
No need for your tears or moans
No one was by my side when I sank into the pit
Certain your compassion is shamed
Outlet for conscience
Look at my scornful eyes staring at you
Your outlet for conscience is to cry for me
My outlet for pity is to spit on your fate
I wish to leave this place unmourned
Outlet for conscience Conscience 
Trust this message of God

I mourn the time of my early youth
Time of binging and indulgence
Old age came  obstructing my path
Finally taking my will
Despair Gone is my time
Downcast Darker than death
A rose woven Wreath
Entwines my cot Death
A rose woven Wreath
Around my corpse
Where are those I followed years ago
Good friends I used to have
Dropped dead some've gone with the wind
May God save those still alive
Despair Gone is my time
Downcast Darker than death
A rose woven Wreath
Entwines my cot Death
A rose woven Wreath
Around my corpse
Human brothers surviving us
Don't resent our offences
If you remember us with compassion
God will bless you all
A rose woven Wreath
Entwines my cot Death
A rose woven Wreath
Around my corpse
Vivid pictures of science's failures
I'm the embodiment of your usurped theories
Succession of images while I'm leaving
Indulgence  Erosion  Punishment  Despair
Seven stages Seven Ways of the Cross
Seven bodies Seven shaped images Disincarnate
Free from my jail of flesh
Far from my earthly trips Disincarnate
Obvious evidence of God's disability
I'm the incarnation of mankind's will
Succession of images before my eyes
Abomination  Conscience  Enjoyment  Anguish
Seven domains Seven mortal remains
Seven cages Seven shaped images Disincarnate
Free from my jail of flesh
Far from my earthly trips Disincarnate
Seven places One era of karma
Seven thoughts but just one living soul 
The lethal storm is bloating my soul from within
The final Cross I bore is nothing now but ashes
Rotten stench as I look at the corpse
Ferment limbs expose the bones
Lies in the pit of rubbish and trash
Here he found his own death
Blackened gore in the screaming mouth
Maggots make in cadaver their houses
Open stomach full of rotting guts
Legs and arms tumefy from the pus
Decomposing putrid corpse
Pungent stink bloody limbs
Swollen flesh mouldy guts
His open eyes look to the sky
Blackened heart under brocken ribs
Wormy flesh gives vile reek
I vomit on his mangled face
I vomit on his mangled rotten face
Ptomaine's oozing from his eyees
Maggots crawl through his skull
Rats are eating his eyeballs
I can't stand it any more
Decomposing cadaver
Rotten stench as I look at the corpse
Ferment limbs expose the bones
Lies in the pit of rubbish and trash
Here he found his own death
Decomposing putrid corpse
Pungent stink bloody limbs
Swollen flesh mouldy guts
My life goes by in mortuary
I like to work with the dead
For me this place is sanctuary
The floor is bloody red
Unfrozen corpse lies on the table
Smell of death in the air
Now I'll get satisfaction
Dead girl with the beautiful hair
I like to touch naked corpses
I like to feel dead skin
Prepare scalpel rusty blade
Stroke her flesh kiss her lips
Burn her scalp on the sconce
Blistering skin and burst up
I saw her skull take the brains
They're oozing through my hands
I take the blade and cut her stomach
Her wet guts are steaming and smell
Ripping through her mangled body
Pulling off the kidney and spleen
I kiss her sticky entrails
I lick the goo from her crotch
I suck out the pus from her mattery skin
I drink ptomaine from her eyes
Bloody limbs brocken bones
Empty eyeholes in the skull
Flies are sitting on the pile of guts
Veins torn out from the flesh
All began from maturation
Limbs are swollen
The black arms and black legs
You suffer from your body torture
My patient needs amputation
I like to see unbearable pain
The tears drops from your eyes
You think of me that I'm a butcher
Limbs putrifaction need amputation
Prepare my tools the catling and saw
Pus seeps through your necrosed skin
Dehydrated turning green
You tremble with fear exite me
I like it My knife stabs into your skin
Incise your flesh on the arm
Your black blood splashes me
Rotting liquid from your cut
Gashes off making stench
Rotten yellow slime intermixed with blood
Drooling on the table
Your scream enrages me
Saw your septic bones away from flesh
Take your carved arm in my hands
Throw it in the heap of stumps
They call me amputator
Begining to saw another arm swollen with pus
Pain in your eyes
Then I saw your decayed blackened legs
With dead skin
Your amputated limbs discharging the infection
Green and yellow matter
Flowing out from under heap
You're lying on the cart
You are looking like a chump
Without arms and legs but you're alive
Putrid remains I must burn down
Smoke in the room malodorous reek
You think of me that I'm a butcher
They call me amputator
Since my childhood I like to see torture
Women suffer from my sudden violence
Waiting in the night alone accidental girl
Compress in my hand knife with gleaming blade
I hear taps of shoes I see beautiful girl
My cock erects now Feeling rush of blood
From the dark of night I jump on the girl
Lift my pointed knife over little head
Her screams die away No one hears in the night
She's falling down before me
I drag her body to bushes
Look at her beautiful face
Feel brutal lust deep inside
I tear her clothes apart
I throw her panties to grass
Take her bust in my hands
It takes my breath away
I have lust for her sticky guts
Blood now gushes from her throat on the ground
I bite her tits I touch her clit
Fucking her open mouth
Trembling rushes through me
Her cunt twitches slightly under my hand
Spurting warm cum
Her lips have a pale blue colour
Perspiration covers my forehead
I take my knife Thrust in her cunt
Cut her flesh from pudenda to throat
Her guts fall out
Moving apart her flesh twisted
Immerse my hands in her bowels
Ripping out her entrails
Bringing up to my face
Her liver gives warmth
My mouth's in her blood
I bite off her tongue
Chew it with her blood
Feeling satisfaction
I dig up the soil for her grave
And throw her body to black pit
Shaking off dirts from my knees
Wipping my mouth from her blood
One more female corpse
Pick up from the ground her guts
Throw out My mind needs a rest
My body wants to sleep
Yesterday I was alive and now I know I'm dead
But what is it I feel no pain
I'm feeling no flesh
Mortuary here I lie
I can see without my eyes
Blood doesn't run into my veins
My brain doesn't serve to me
Lying on cold table I see my lifless corpse
Deathit's not the end of human life
Soulit's spring of life in the beyond
Coroner cuts my stomach pulling out my guts
He saws my skull takes my white and grey brain
Place my corpse in the coffin
Nail the cascet lid
I hear the bell tolls and noise of earth
My corpse gutted and cleaned
Lies in the grave under ground
I know nothing what will be with me
I've been lying here for many years and rot
Maggots ate my intestines long ago
I feel the strenght fill my lifless corpse
Beggining to crash my rotten coffin
Now I come out from the grave
My mind works inside my skull
Forbidden evil is rulling me
I need flesh and human brains
I will consume it by my jaws
I am creation of father Satan
You will die I'm bringing world destruction
He goes to the cemetery dead of night
Spade and bag at his back empty sight
He digs up soil of grave under moon
Deep in ground can't see him inside the tomb
He lifts the lid of wooden coffin
Feeling smell of rotten flesh
Buried corpse not long ago it begins decay
Searching values l ooking at the corpse
He sees a golden ring
The precious stone shining in the night
Attracts the evil man
Deadly frozen cold
Swollen from the pus hand of dead man
He can't take it off
He takes a knife cuts the hand of the corpse
Crack of bones tearing veins clots of gore
Taking the hand of the corpse in his hand
Smile on face Puts it down in his bag
Ossified flesh can't stand for itself
Pulling out gold teeth nothing can stop him
Verminous mouth full of white maggots
He takes in his hand the knife
And cuts the mouth of corpse
Maggots are falling down
From rotten flesh on dampy earth
He wants to leave the robbed grave
He stands on putrid corpse
His foot breaks rotten chest
And falls in intestines
Pungent stench of fetid goo
Splash of pus and broken bones
Clatches at the cold tombstone
Come out from the open grave
He goes to the cemetery dead of night
Spade and bag at his back empty sight
He digs up soil of grave under moon
Deep in ground can't see him inside the tomb
Pile of guts lies on bloody floor
You see bodies gutted and dissected
Without heads are hanging on hooks
Their blood drops down from cut throats
Delectation to roast the human's meat
Digestive parts are ready to cook
Malformation It's the end of sanity
Wild addiction Lust of roasted meat
For dinner soup ripping out the eyes
Sucking out the brain from hole of cracked skull
Sharp blade in my hand pierses into your skin
Warm guts now appear
Cut your heart in two
My clothes soaked with blood
Hungry in my eyers
Mutilation Necrophagia
Chewing on the liver
Drinking viscid blood
Bodies cut in half
Steam from open stomach
Dark possessed my mind
Blind desire to kill
Execution for roast meat
Putrifaction
Unnecessary unpalatable parts of guts
Pool of blood
Bleeding chunks of flesh spewing pus
Cut heads without eyes
Lie in corner slowly rot
Horrid kitchen Induldgement
Execution for roast meat
All my real victims are the children
I am killing them strangulation
The fresh dead bodies lies in the room
Look at their necks I'm thirsty for blood
Hot red blood
Evil in my brain lives with cruelty
Blood tastes nice drives me nuts
Take the body little corpse
Carry it to the bathroom
Take my knife cut the throat
Fountain splashes aside
I drink the blood
Running warm stream down my throat
Belive in the strength that gives me the gore
My organism becomes younger
I feel liquid runs down my oesophagus
Soaks in my internal organs
Blood gives me intoxication
Child falls down before my feet
Drained dead body now turn blue
Take another little corpse
Cut his veins on the arms
Place the jars under wounds
Slowly filling sticky blood
Keep this drink in the fridge
Till I'm thirsty
Nothing want more
I drink only blood
I can't see any liquid
Pour acid into the bath
I must destroy all traces
Their bodies corrode by acid
Denouncing your slaves I claim as my own
Master of darkness creator of lies
Burdened with envy my beauty despised
I born of fire I will not prostate
He made of clay I will seal his fate
My music of beauty now music of sin
Devouring mankind I will draw him
Bow down to the king of hell
A blackened heart you've sentenced to die
Tears are falling falling from the sky
Your angel of light now an angel of darkness
Eternal betrayer the tormenting temptress
I curse the heavens as I fall
Angels gathered one and all
Descent from heaven your final command
Denounced condemned into fiery land
Bow down to the king of hell
Blackness fills your sky of blue
Smoke and fire is my hand of doom
Falling from grace bringing hate divine
Pain and sorrow fill their hearts and minds
The war in heaven you think you have won
The battle for souls has only begun
Good and evil now given birth
Hate will spread upon your earth
Breather of death and destruction I am
A prince of deceit the lord of the damned
Murderers the world falls dead
Beautiful blackened skies
Reflect upon the streaks of red
Nothing is what we are
A bottomless pit of darkness
In search of souls to scar
Witness the lawless swarm
Self inflicted holocaust
Worship the God of Scorn
The plague called man
Ruler of barren horizons
And vast empty lands
A manifest dream of desolation
Dark shadows spread across
All of his deadly creations
Death incarnate our world euthanized
Lying in state
Mouring our own demise
Witness the lawless swarm
Self inflicted holocaust
Worship the God of Scorn
The plague called man
Ruler of barren horizons
And vast empty lands
Creator of cataclysms
Agent of destruction
Apocalyptic visions
Relent to these seductions
All of our tears are shed in vain
For spitting at God
Vengeance is slow and filled with pain
Destitute unholy vision
Deep is the slumber
That calls us into submission
Witness the lawless swarm
Self inflicted holocaust
Worship the God of Scorn
The plague called man
Ruler of barren horizons
And vast empty lands
I'm the cross that you bare
The darkness of the sky
I'm your crown of thorns
Your neverending cry
I'm the rusted nails
That pierced your hands and feet
I'm the pointed spear
That's buried in you deep
Now it all begins
The torment never ends
How much must you bleed
To fill my lustful needs
Oh now the torture's sublime
Over and over you die
But I'll keep you alive
So the hatred inside me can thrive
I'm your Via Dolorosa
The thirst that will not be quenched
I'm the place of the skull
With claws firmly entrenched
I'm the dogs that surround you
The dislocation of bones
I'm the spit on your face
Abandoned and all alone
Now it all begins
The torment never ends
How much must you bleed
To fill my lustful needs
Oh now the torture's sublime
Over and over you die
But I'll keep you alive
So the hatred inside me can thrive
I'm the whips that shred your back
The sun that burns your skin
You are but the forsaken
I'm the anguish within
I'm the dust in your eyes
The softest kiss of betrayal
I'm the pain in your side
The final abhorrent exhale
Now it all begins
The torment never ends
How much must you bleed
To fill my lustful needs
Oh now the torture's sublime
Over and over you die
But I'll keep you alive
So the hatred inside me can thrive
Blood red skies showers of acid rain
Humanities logistic waste of time
Parasites sucking their own blood dry
When empires fall
Well see them crawl
Awaiting deaths call
Terror struck beyond belief as chaos multiplies
The day has come for man to pay for his sins
Festering fate spreading out of control
Toxic breath embraces their souls
When empires fall
Well see them crawl
Awaiting deaths call
Watching your loved ones die
Hearing the helpless cries
The wage for man made sin
This is the end
Humanities logistic waste of time
Parasites sucking their own blood dry
When empires fall
Well see them crawl
Awaiting deaths call
A man of the cross
Forced down on his knees
He questions his faith and morality
Drawn by the smell
And the luxury of sin
He prays for forgiveness
But still he gives in
Desperately falling
But not knowing why
Into the darkness
He is living a lie
Lambs to the slaughter
Each led in deceit
Blind and misguided
Feeble and weak
Wicked disposition
Lost of all faith and hope for his soul
Wicked disposition
His collar is tarnished
His cross upside down
The Holy Scriptures
Are thrown to the ground
Perplexed by his feelings
This soul laid to waste
Eternal damnation
There's no saving grace
No longer a servant
Of the unseen
His words sacrilegious
To praise the obscene
Lambs to the slaughter
Each led in deceit
Blind and misguided
Feeble and weak
Wicked disposition
Lost of all faith and hope for his soul
Wicked disposition
Screams form the pulpit
Such blasphemous things
He is the culprit
Defaced Nazarene
Black is the blood
That flows through his veins
Sin is a flood
That keeps him in chains
Lambs to the slaughter
Each led in deceit
Blind and misguided
Feeble and weak
Wicked disposition
Lost of all faith and hope for his soul
Wicked disposition
Lost of all faith and hope for his soul
Wicked disposition
Desecrator the way the world sees me
To hold you near eternally
Isolation in necrophilia
Preserved in your crypt memorabilia
Confessed why I'm so strange
Molest I am deranged
Possessed by your living soul
Obsessed I cannot let go
I crave the blank stare in your eyes
The feeling of cold flesh
Caress of the dead
In the darkness I hear you so clearly
Dark twisted thoughts on dead lips I feed
My carcass of love dissected of stench death
Exhumed for my lust entombed for my needs
Confessed why I'm so strange
Molest I am deranged
Possessed by your living soul
Obsessed I cannot let go
I crave the blank stare in your eyes
The feeling of cold flesh
Caress of the dead
How can a world be so cruel
To not see what you mean to me
The time is here my dear
And I now must set you free
I hope you can hear I hope you can see me
Your eyes of glass only just stare
Desecrator the way the world saw me
Inamorata they take you away
Confessed why I'm so strange
Molest I am deranged
Possessed by your living soul
Obsessed I cannot let go
I crave the blank stare in your eyes
The feeling of cold flesh
Caress of the dead
I feel pain because I can
I feel pain therefore I am
Focus on the twisting turning
Focus on the breaking burning
Self inflicted ways of bleeding
Pain addicted always needing
Merciless and unbending
Misery unending
Pain
Pain will be thy name
Pain
Pain will be thy name
It takes me to the darkest place
Envelops me in its cold embrace
It takes me to where time stands still
Where pain destroys but does not kill
I feel pain because its real
It is God before I kneel
I feel pain it speaks no lies
I feel pain it hears no cries
Pain
Pain will be thy name
Pain
Pain will be thy name
Poised and calm endless sting
A silent bomb my dearest king
Sliding down the razors edge
My loyalty to you I pledge
The veil of blood that coats my skin
My panacea perpetual sin
Rancid smell of sweat and steel
Scars that never mend or heal
Shards of glass that slice and tear
Rotting fetor fills the air
I close my eyes and lie in wait
For precious pain to seal my fate
Pain
Pain will be thy name
Pain
Pain will be thy name
Deep inside this cavity
In the caverns of my soul
The eternal pit of rage
Begins to overflow
Choking every ray of light
No one hears their killing pleas
Consuming every drop of life
Only I can set them free
I keep searching
For the things I can never find
Dark thoughts keep lurking
Cruel and unkind
There is no refuge
Only hatred that transcends
I cant stand the deluge
Of tears for the condemned
In my darkness
I am the waking dream
In my darkness
I reign supreme
Ill find peace
In the solace of despair
Anguish released
On the naÃÂÃÂ¯ve and unaware
Shrouded in the glory
Of my lovely scorn
Deviant story
Of the broken ripped and torn
In my darkness
I am the waking dream
In my darkness
I reign supreme
I'm your savior
Your betrayer
Liberator
Your enslaver
Demonic voice
Infiltrates my mind
I will rejoice
As reality unwinds
On my killing spree
Your sins I will erase
The last thing you'll see
Is my fucking stoic face
In my darkness
I am the waking dream
In my darkness
I reign supreme
I see you wince in agony
You scream in prayer but no one hears
Get off your knees and stand by me
I'm here to cleanse you of your fears
I know your hearts desires
To bathe in heavenly fires
To be the king of kings
To have the knowledge of all things
This weight is far too much to bear
The whole worlds coming down on you
You think those people even care
About the pain that you'll go through
I know your hearts desires
To bathe in heavenly fires
To be the king of kings
To have the knowledge of all things
Pleas for mercy fade into the night
This chalice will not pass from you
The blood you sweat smells of your doom
Your fathers words have all been lies
Take my hand you'll never die
The garden of temptation
The garden of temptation
regret But why should we take advice from the
our own heads Self Preservation
a brand new life
becomes tomorrow's hard luck
Resurrect Prepare your heart for what lies ahead
Where do I go Am I on my own
ahead
One army of braves
With their pride fight again
Gloomy dim lights
Ghostly parade
Of grudged corpses feel the Hell
Fighting again
When freedom calls
Shake the graves of valiants knight
Resort for revenge
Back's from the graves
For who betrayed a glory past
In battle again
Under the sign
Of the sacred Muntain their guide
And for the last time
other pain in my mind
Eternal warriors
You'll fight forever
In blood and fire rule again
Shortest way
To die is courage
Proud way follow it
Eternal warriors
Spirit of ancients
Lost of the heroes
Our guide
Children of Sorrow
Reborns in rage forgets the Heaven
Now your home is the Hell
The black horizon I feel in my mind
When the lonely soul receive the sign
The dominion on Earth shall return to the Beast
The ancients speaks from their old shrines
Lead my sacred sword when my rage is blind
The invisible Eye control the triumphant pride
The darkness flame burn on the grave
Of the mighty lord that broke the chains
The Circle of Fire
Are burning tears of the defeateds
In a simphony of steel and fire
Black revengers of the night
Are the Circle of Fire
In the deep of heart I posses the fire
That will burn the corpses of my enemies died
The night arrive like the cold dark ice
Into shadows dream are the undid disguise
Whisper in the winds
Of a winter lonyless
Then I turn my eyes and see
The land of mighty lords
The land of ancient Gods
There a millenary seed relive
Trough the whirling snow
And from the deepest caves
The mighty ancestor voice proclame
Follow me
In the land of shining shields
Follow me
In the land of ancient memories
Follow me
Across the lost empire
Follow me
No longer you can hide
No longer I can hide
No longer I can wait
Like many night before
The shadow of a pale Moon
Show me the hidden sacred path
The howl of thousand wolves
Is rising from the deep
Across the frozen woods is calling me
Shining Moon embrace my soul
Because tonight I received the call
I bring the signs of chosen one
I lead in the story the name of my clan
A secret rise from the deep of past
Prophecy in the story
The Ancient God's have prepared the day
We are ready for the glory
The rage of wolf came into the hearts
The fury is our allied
The strong of bear came into the arms
Our enemies already tremble
The dark essence flow across the veins
An inner pain erase my human state
The fear collapse in the research of death
Our cowardice is dead
The sacred power mould me like the clay
The hymn of the thunder consecrate the rain
Go valiant man your moment is came
strong is your heart and strong is your fate
the blood that you shed will feeding the ground
the souls that you tear will feeding the Stars
it's open to the mighty warriors
Their elms shining at shrine flames
their swords screaming revenge
Mighty warriors mighty warriors
fights your holy war
Your steel your fire your glory and pride
Forever in the name of Divines
Conversation with the silence
Gets me safer through the night
Let me listen to your words
Who am I
I'm a fool that lost the way
Led by agony and pain
Shall I drown in boundless sorrow
Who I am
I look around into the mirror
And it feels right
I come alive my mind gets clearer
I don't want to hear your
LIES
Of one more paradise
Come alive now
I am dying inside
Since I have lost reliance
It's an endless sacrifice
Await the afterlife
Won't you die now
I am dying inside
I have lost reliance
It's an endless sacrifice
I lay my life into your wisdom
Not to find that I'm restrained
Nor to find me here in prison
I'm afraid
I'm getting closer to the mirror
Still it feels right
My troubled mind is turning weirder
Knowing you're just telling
My perfect heaven turns to grey
Storm is rising through the dark of night
I shiver deep inside
As the memory fade away
I reach into the light
Waiting for the end of night
Heaven is burning without you
It's burning me inside
I'm falling down
The world is not turning
Without you
It's breakin' me inside
My heaven burns
Will this ever be the same
I hear the emptiness
Call my name
My memory betrayed
Will I ever break the chains
I reach into the light
Longing for the end of night
Silence starts to whisper
That sad lullaby
Of you and I
I'm driftin' into darkness
When I close my eyes
I start to cry
Fading illusions
Lost in the
Dark of the night
Once I woke with tired eyes
Left the doors wide open
Listening as the laughter dies
Hear the silence growing
All this heartache
Can't decline with you not here
Tearful memories creeping with the fear
Passing through a winter night
Strawling through the deadness
Dreaming of the end in sight
Fall into the sadness
A lonely rider
Flying on the wings of past
Through the fire
'Til the dies been cast
Take me to the shore
Don't wanna see me die
Like I did before
Walk right through
This door
Don't wanna see me cry
Like I did before
This is the life that
Leaves us restless
It's the end of all that
We have known before
The search for beauty
Leaves us breathless
In these days where nothing
Matters anymore
This is not our dying 
I'm holding on
Flying to the sun
Keep holding on
'Til I'm alive
This is the time that
Built resistance
Stole the innocence of
An illusive dream
We're fighting back to
Close the distance
For the change that
Has to come
And set us free
This is not our dying 
I'm holding on
Flying to the sun
Keep holding on
'Til I'm alive
The deafness in my mind
Is screaming
Where did we go blind
Lost the way
Fortune predefined
No other meaning
Where shall we go
When our lives collide
Straight to the borderline
Feeding the virus of hatred
Don't take this heart of mine
Is this the last serenade
Wide awake  Still forlorn
Break of day  Educing the storm
Bitter end  Compelling me to rest
In silence
'Til we fade away
Ignorance was kind
Continous
Rising with the tide
Tearin' down trust
With emptiness aside
Outrageous
All we have been
Is turning to dust
Straight to the borderline
Feeding the virus of hatred
Don't take this heart of mine
Is this the last serenade
Wide awake  Still forlorn
Break of day  Educing the storm
Bitter end  Compelling me to rest
In silence
'Til we fade away
Busy city morning
As an explosion
Takes the peace away
People running round in
Chaotic motion
'Cross the fiery place
Bodies lying lifeless
Cover the ground with
Blood of innocence
Sirens cut the silence
An act of violence
Inconceivable
And all that will remain
Is the memory of the pain
A terrifying calmness
Let my senses slip away
Watching their faces on fire
Screaming through the crow
Chaotic senselessness
Burnin' hope for untroubled life
Speak every kill takes you higher
To paradise in hell
Innocence has died
As we've lost the way
Shattered by this madness
A tearful sadness growing
Deep inside
Killing in the name of
Absurd illusions
Needless suicide
Lying alone lost in a dream
Breathing gets harder
With you not here
All by myself  once more you're gone
How can I embrace you
When you're not near
Open your eyes  when you turn to the light
We're losing ground on this way
Open your eyes  and kick of your pride
Before there is no more to say
Free your mind
Break the chains
Don't run away
All that I try is staying alive
But I have to find me
Frozen inside
I have become a slave to your will
Seems like our time
Is moving in for the kill
Open your eyes  when you turn to the light
We're losing ground on this way
Open your eyes  and kick of your pride
Before there is no more to say
Free your mind
Break the chains
Don't run away
Take your time  look inside
Leave behind you will find
In the end I will be by your side
Turn the tide just step out
Of the dark come with me
Oh  and come with me
For too long we stood in pain
Haven't seen the light of day
Feel the rising in between
Our circle of pride
No more secret lullabies
No more whispers in disguise
A new fate is born within
Our precious minds
We will find a way through
Once there will be a time
The day we return to light
And fighting is over
Water turns to wine
We step behind the line
At the end of the darkest night
This is our time
Filled with passion filled with love
Blessed with goodwill from above
It's the dawn of a new dream
Feel it rise
In our blood and in our veins
We escape the golden cage
Break the chains around our hearts
A fateful turn
We have found a way through
Tempus Fugit
Memento Vivere
Still we need to learn
To seize the day
Our fate has turned
Darkness away
The ring an empty place
Don't want to hide my face
I hear the calling
Of my saddest feelings inside
They always laugh at me
About the mask they see
But even then their eyes are
Closed to what is behind
My whole life is a charade
The pretender that I am
An insidious masquerade
No one will ever see
The truth in my life
The curtain falls
The light fades
I am lost in this lie
Crying in silence is all
Left for me
No one sees the tears of a clown
But me
It feels as cold as ice
I've learned to pay the price
I am the servant
Of your pleasure
And my deceit
But what else could I be
This lie is part of me
I stumble through the night
And fall into a dream
Where my life is
Not a charade
No pretender that I am
No insidious masquerade
Whispers inside
Keep telling me I'll break down
Nowhere to hide
It feels like I am falling
But I can feel it
As a desire
I'm gonna give you all of me
I can hear you
The call of angels
Now come and take me
I am ready
Open the gates and
Take my soul
I won't be afraid of
Losing it all
I'm not falling from grace
I'll save my face
Transcend the shadows
Keeping me away
No life inside
My mind's so numb so clouded
The candle has died
There's coldness all around me
And I still hear you
The call of angels
Now come and take me
I am ready
Hiding searching
My blood runs cold
Emptiness is crying
A fairytale untold
The ruins of what was
Once a dream
Arose within the fight
Left within the memories
There's nothin' more inside
Hold me when I'm dying
I fear to be alone
Save me when I'm crying
Can't take it on my own
Now that I am stranded
Blind and broken
Will you light the darkness
For I am willing to believe
Silent whispers
Keep me awake
Cold night
Creeps into me
Turns colors into grey
The story of a dying day
Is all I have to tell
So speaking with my
One last breath
I bid you my farewell
In rage  The fear is hunting me
In pain  A life of agony
In tears  Somebody call this
Heart of sorrow
The dark  It came into my life
The thrill  Keep me awake at night
The fear  How will I ever reach
tomorrow
It's burning me from deep inside
The emptiness is rising within
No place to hide I'm on my own
The night became a friend on My side
My darkest hour
Came with the shadows
Feels like I
Take the weight of the world
A shattered soul
I see the world in darkness
Torn and ruined in disgrace
Wake me now
Your tears  There is
No place to hide
Your fear  Attender at my side
Your blood  A frozen curse that
Leaves me haunted
Your fate  Is driving me insane
I'll rise  I can't escape the pain
I'm here  Somebody take away
This madness now
Still burning me the end in sight
The loneliness is rising within
He's on my side I'm all alone
thoughts raped
amplifies my fears
thoughts raped
you were never here
i feel it vibrating below the surface of reality
bleed from
eternal wounds of torment
bleed from 
eternal wounds of judgment
thoughts raped
amplifies my fears
thoughts raped
you were never here
so long to the end we all come from
say goodbyesay its over
to the life that we've always known
i'm left all alone
fly away from this pain you've always known
bleed from
eternal wounds of torment
bleed from 
eternal wounds of judgment
to the end we all come from
say goodbyesay its over i'm left all alone
fly away from this pain you've always known
i've fallen deeper into the abyss
further than i care to go
no hope no return
all i have is nothing
conclusion bringing an end to my life
no reminiscing now
no thoughts no control
all i am is nothing
scarring disgrace shame fill all of my being
i cant escape the words you left me bleeding
revealing all from another place in time
our lives collide mortality leaves us
close your eyes
for the last 
no more lies
for the last
time
destroying hope i guess that i'm to blame
revealing all from another place in time
our lives collide mortality leaves us
close your eyes
for the last 
no more lies
for the last
time
through it all your realize
its allmeaningless in this life
beating pleading sending your life
to eternal rest
eternal rest
feeding this rage light meets its end
heaven shall speak to the ignored once again
all is not lost when nothing can be
time distortion leaves impurity
consciousness is only a dream
endless decay of eternal beam
all speak of life this speaks of death
craving the end and your last breath
on our way down we are forced down
not stopping now we are forced down
endlessly transcending 
on our way down we are forced down
not stopping now we are forced down
fall  take this time away
dead  erase the memory
fall  transcend this in me
dead  not alone
we all connect within
a human common ground
it all embraces us
we neverwe never cease to be
no death it all begins
into a realm within
it all embraces us
we neverwe never say goodbye
no space or time within
a realm inside i breathe again
self and demise is gone
i am no more and never from
dead and gone my life subsides
into a realm of eternal cries
freezing dark my world dies
freezing dark my world dies
as my hand grasps our fatal lie
no space or time all is gone
to witness it is all or none
all or nothing two paths must choose
nothing more than a soul to lose
i've spent all my life
demons inside sending to the grave
hopelessly lost out of control
how can i ever be saved
forced to live in pain never wanted
i never asked for this
longing inside always alive
yet closer to the dead
forced into locked for life
i live inside this lifetime
never wanted never asked for
im breaking away
you have nothing to say
im breaking away
from you
death pain rage and hate
giving me strength speaking to me inside
i fall away never again will i see the light
burning my eyes haunting my thoughts
gripping my soul with fear
under my skin blood running thin
weakness has taken hold
forced into locked for life
i live inside this lifetime
im breaking away
you have nothing to say
im breaking away
from you
the moment approaching to detach my self
from all of life's uncertainties
to find a truth for my self
in every point of time
break away
separatebreak it away
break it away from me
darkness killing the light now
no perception of life
chest tight cant breathe cant move
living in this personal fight
control let it go get thought
is it real is it fake do i die 
get advice take pills sit still
living proof its all bullshit lie
looking back i wonder how
i went this far into my head
forcing me to feel this now
wonder if im better off dead
chemical propaganda
making money off our strain
find the answers within
alone by myself and with out pain
fall
against my self theres something else
i fall away 
years have gone by 
friends have passed away
but we remain
here for the pain
locked inside of me
i am never free
pull me under 
be with the pleasure
pull me under 
beneath desire
pull me under
be with the pleasure
pull me under
beneath desire
stars of serpents blinding open eyes
thought provoked by a distance gaze
the violated womb shall bare a life
a life to only fight and die
only fight and die
corpse of vega is rotting forever
yet for her it seems that time stops
haunted always by a ghost of the past
in the blacken depths of the sky
pull me under 
be with the pleasure
pull me under 
beneath desire
pull me under
be with the pleasure
pull me under
beneath desire
old
the ways of the sure
dead
the ways that are told
old
the ways of the sure
dead
the ways that are told
shades of orange light fill the sky
procyon 77 sets upon the soul
walking on the path of rotting corpse
i push on
take the shame from me now
sun sets in a pool of blood
light is gone
cold and dark start to fill the soul
9000 souls marching on eternal
take the blame from me now
bring to an end
the silent wait
take the shame away from me
the blame away from me
the pain away from me
there are no answers now
the shame away from me
the blame away from me
the pain away from me
there are no answers now
final destinations draws near
time is gone

i've become the path that i marched on

judgment comes
with no escape
we lay them down
this hellish day
lose all after time
you thats always been
embrace your existence
name is now nothing
to see is not to believe you exist
closer to becoming more than myself
self dead
who am i 
and what is this
embrace the lie
could this be it 
lose all after time
you thats always been
embrace your existence
name is now nothing
to see is not to believe you exist
closer to becoming more than myself
self dead
we die to self we start to live
living life than our self
i will never be what you saw in me
tell your lies now
i'm the one you hate
that i beat you down
you dont decide my fate
forced into your game
you suffocate me
hide your nameless shame
why wont you ever let it be 
long i await
to feel your pain
i was never what you thought i was
no one will ever know
the lie you told her
keep it in your heart
and never show her
the truth inside
you know you caused me
a pain to hide
why wont you ever set me free 
move on
forget the past
move on nothing ever lasts
and you still want me dead
welcome you are to this world of deceit
locked in addiction that makes you complete
descending deception upon you all
tortured with pleasure left only to fail
vision of ecstasy a painful delight
longing for the one thing that will set you free
only deceived again by false security
two pieces
i have become
two pieces
i lost myself into the darkness
where am i when i have felt this
pain
unending eternal nightmare dismay
in thisthe darkness it pulls you away
control the end  control all 
looking back watching your dreams dissolve
two pieces
i have become
two pieces
i lost myself into the darkness
where am i when i have felt this
pain
fuck off
you give your demons to me
and i take them from you
your pain is washed away
your life is taken from you
fuck offCaught in shadow
Hidden low away from the sun
In the silence
Where the safety is found
Beneath the stones
Within the soil
In the warmth of the ground
They rest their weary heads
From dust until dawn
But as the day breaks
She climbs upstairs
Though the fear surrounds
The taste of the air
And sudden shapes just
Quickly appear
On the northern hill
Not far from here
And all those greedy eyes
And all their eager sighs
As all their howls raised her scare
Setting off
No time to spare
Her sentence was clear
As all their eyes of lust
That held her so dear
Oh you hear them howl
As they come through the woods
She slowly ran along as fast as she could
Beyond the rural safety just too old to supply
She just ran and ran as fast as she could
And all those greedy eyes
And all their eager sighs
As all their howls raised her scare
Setting off
No time to spare
Her sentence was clear
As all their eyes of lust
That held her so dear
Oh you hear them howl
As they come through the woods
They closing in on your path
They are drawn to your blood
Crimson patterns resurrected
On that torn old wooden floor
She gets forced my their hatred
Deep in behind those welllocked doors
And they'll howl howl
Yes they'll howl howl
Jaws are fighting for that pleasure
Dark breath so far from grace
Until all of her is wasted
Crooked silent there she lay
And they'll howl howl
Yes they'll howl howl howl
Oh you hear them howl
As they come through the woods
They closing in on your path
They are drawn to your blood
The labyrinthe innermost 
Recess of time 
Throws up a deepredfoam 
Which mingles with the millenial backwash 
Of a deserted beach 
In the deepest depht of a frozen winter 
And the horizon becomes inflamed 
And the whole earth starts a rough symphony 
By the sound of the roaring water 
The whole earth starts a rough symphony
Get ready to bite to spit to yell 
With scorn and bile tear out the veil 
Galvanised rushing through your veins 
Radiant energy roaring for pains 
Feel the boiling blood  
Feel and fell again 
The eternity of the instant 
Feel the blast 
Fuel the fire 
Embrace the pyre 
So suffer and suffer more 
Rage and blast once again and forevermore 
Only violence transforms us deep 
Only pain sharpens our teeth 
We suffer and suffer forevermore 
Rage and blast 
Cuz in the end 
We get it all 
So many ways to face the void 
Flesh wisdom beliefs fight 
So many ways to face the void 
All I know is I can't close my eyes 
Emptiness crushes my soul 
Values and feelings are lies 
The saint just can only sin 
The faithful always betrays 
And the priest invokes illusions 
Emptiness crushes my soul 
I wish I was never born 
To feel the violence of truth 
Nothing is everything 
Everything is nothing 
Oblivion could set me free
Stronger even if I lay on my back 
I'm me 
Alone 
Let the bells ring the same tune 
My blood remains cold 
My heart will stay cold 
My heart remains cold 
Drink my wine and blur your mind 
My blood remains cold 
Melt with my blood 
My heart remains cold 
The wine of disaster is served to be drunk 
I'm stronger 
I'm me 
The wine of disaster is served to be drunk 
As the bleeding red sun 
Burns the mortal's souls 
Glows through your veins 
Heats your drying soil 
The undying forces of light 
Shall wash your sins away 
Towards oneness  
Accept the age of dissidence 
Embark on the journey 
You don't wanna see 
Forget your old dissonance 
Set your soul free 
In the hands of another deity 
In the crux of humanity
A burn for a burn 
A wound for a wound 
A bruise for a bruise 
A life for a life 
Get on your fuckin' knees 
Before your master 
I only feel disgust 
For your thrust 
Get on your fuckin' knees 
Before your master 
Taste the bitter seed 
Which gonna poison 
Your filthy blood
You liar
Begging mercy for your sins
You lead my fury
I'll watch you down on your knees
You closed your ears
I'll lock your eyes
I don't care for you tears
Now you're living in fear
The end of your story is near
I'll watch you down on your knees
Crying for absolution
I'll watch you down on your knees
Praying for redemption
You betrayer
You feel sorry you're so weak
I destroyer
I feel sorry for youcunt
A burn for a burn
A wound for a wound
A bruise for a bruise
A life for a life
I only feel disgust for your thrust
You liar
Begging mercy for your sins
You lead my fury
I'll watch you down on your knees
You betrayer
You feel sorryyou are so weak
I destroyer
I feel sorry for youcunt 
A burn for a burn
A wound for a wound
A bruise for a bruise
A life for a life
We take more 
In the shadow 
Tighter stronger nastier 
We grasp more 
In the darkness 
At the treshold of Death 
There's just you and me 
Your soul can not feed 
Flesh is all I need 
And now 
Accept the blade 
Share the grim reaper 
And come
Chronic Hell
Now we live everyday man the best way we can
Out on the streets their there
The bustling crowds hinder their way
And without fear they press on and on
So in our sheltered homes we wait patiently
'Til the cowering few
Breath their final breath
And so the plague it spreads
Selecting prey randomly
Our so it would seem
feed by the cowering few
The battle weary bring the wounded home
The soles of the dead face the Holy one
As the king smiles unto the rose
Justified in what he knows
Sing glory to the king for his holy win
Over territory 
We bury the dead and turn the horses for home
After laying a wreath against the last tombstone
A final word for the passing by the holy priest
We head for home for a celebratory feast
It's back after 10 short years away
And it's motivation
They're more intense this time
He is in every nightmare and stocks me everyday
I'm infected by him and its deep into my core
The devastation of knowing what lies ahead
He is in every nightmare and stocks me everyday
I'm infected by him and its deep into my core
Is that death in your eyes
Is that death in your practiced smile
Now you've established your ties
We all think that you're
We all think that you're
Scheduled pills is just a code
Deep depression is just a way of life
And to this faith you must hold
We all fear that you're
We all fear that you're
I hear you say we don't care
All we need is our attitude
Positivity will get us there
And we fell for you
Yes we feel for you
That you're
Where the darkness screams
From a syphilis mind
Your oh so distorted aborted grave is the one
Where the darkness screams
Renouncing who's counting
What will your tombstone read
Where the darkness screams
Do you have the team to go the distance
Is it your passion or someone else s scheme
Is it your team that makes the difference
Or is it the power that comes from within
It s not your team there just a factor
It s your heart and the dreams your own
That's the power of the dream
Do you understand there will be some pain 
Now your clean and satisfied
Where did your stain go
Well now I wear your stain
Tempers in the cauldron
Have just about to reach boiling point
Anger steps up to the throne
For you to anoint
And in the morning
Through one black eye
You refuse to see
The cracked mirror
Pouring gasoline on fire
Is like you and alcohol
Only fools could find an answer
In the bottle that you hold
And in the morning
Through one black eye
You'll refuse to see
The cracked mirror
Act one scene three
And I still see no change in your attitude
Your friend has left you
'Cause she didn't like to be abused oh no
And in the morning
Alone at last
Face to face you see
The cracked mirrorKeep my secret deep within
hear my call
Oh oh how I cry
In the lone night
please save me from
the embrace denying my future
Where are you father
Where are you mother
Come from the deep
Bless me protect me
from her cold fingers
Echoes of terror
In this solitude
WhereÃÂ´s my angel
I remember your eyes and
How we played together
Angel
I feel fear
Darkness is coming
watch out from your back
here we are
Why I hear but silence
Hunting your last breath
stealing your soul
torn apart
Get out this cold
Keeping the cold
even colder
around and inside
Freezing my illusions
Stalking the child
you once was
where is it now
The whisper of rain will bring me life
From an unique memory
Missing inside the twilight
The crown of my sunrise
and moon of my pale night
Chant in horizon brings hope
Defeat all my fears
and make sound my best play
Come from the blue
Bless me
protect me from her cold fingers
Echoes of terror
In this solitude
WhereÃÂ´s my angel
I remember your eyes and
How we played together
Angel
Cure me from this illness
Caressing the moonlight
Sweet touch dreaming the angels
Blue is the soul of silence
Keep my secret deep within
ColdÃÂ´s invading all of me
Comet of my ultimate yearning
Chained and merged forever to you
Freedom
To smile in peace
Freedom
To paint the sky with
My hopes
Stretch your hands
Take my love
Keep it with you
Rest for this night
Rest in my shoulders
my saviour downcast
Echoes of terror
In this solitude
WhereÃÂ´s my angel
I remember your eyes and
How we played together
Angel
White mist rising from the floor
Where am I now
Your smell singing everywhere
This should be peace
I have felt the ocean
Wished for the moon
Caressed the darkness
Swam in the sun
Sad is the day Rest for this night
Dark is the journey Eternal Whisper
When the moment comes May you find peace here
No victory nor defeat
Had no chance to fight
Dreaming the path to your smile
Tell me you are here
I have felt the ocean
Wished for the moon
Caressed the darkness
Swam in the sun
Great is the day Precious the day
Long is the journey Precious the journey
For to go back home Staring Shooting stars
I fear the deep silence of my tears
Sunken in the darkness they imposed me
where I cannot scape from
Keep my demons in the past for I can born again
Cause tomorrow the sun wonÃÂ´t shine for me
because there is a place for hate
I have to go towards forgiveness
Give me your hand
donÃÂ´t leave me
donÃÂ´t let loneliness
to surround me
until the end of my days
Look at me
now IÃÂ´m you
IÃÂ´m the one
I should not have been
Dark secrets of my heart
open the door to the cruel destiny
that should not were  forged
Cause tomorrow the sun wonÃÂ´t shine for me
because there is a place for hate
I have to go towards forgiveness
Save me from myself
save you from me
Sadness tomorrow
sadness yesterday
Free me from myself keep my pain with you
turned into the reflect of your dark evil
Show me no mercy
Go away Monsters
Bless me in the night
with a sunbeam that guides my steps
Cause tomorrow the sun wonÃÂ´t shine for me
because there is a place for hate
I have to go towards forgiveness
And pain went through a way without end
and hope came to a body without a soul
and hate went towards a face without face
Tell me God tell me Lord
Why do we find
in death the sense of our life
if we cannot rectify
Only pay for what
we should have done
but we did not
Will in his death
the atheist find God
Will in his death
the priest realizes his God was a lie
All the same before
the dark final sight
And what if death
comes today
Is this the final judgmentÃÂ´day
Why do we find
in death the sense of our life
if we cannot rectify
Only pay for what
we should have done
but we did not
Will in his death
the atheist find God
Will in his death
the priest realizes his God was a lie
Human kind great powerful
but it comes for all of us
Will in his death
the atheist find God
Will in his death
the priest realizes his God was a lie
Tell me you are there
Great Lord
please tell me
Have my tears been in vain
Look at me
I am the feared dark one
And I write the End
The wind howls with grief
A frightening shiver
comes from far beyond time
Lonely hope may now the sunrise bless your path
Your souls will remain out of the march of time
Once you could stare at the stars
Sing with them and dream together in the shore
Hear my prayer
Silence the pain
In your wings there is dust
And blood
Why canÃÂ´t I
Save your desintegrated dreams
Build a wall around my innocence
To protect me against the red inferno
Save me from hell
DonÃÂ´t let go my hand from your care
Save my name
Make me remember when we walked the moonpath
Our hands together within the sweet breeze
Softly caress my trace drawn under the moonguide
The ocean will sing my tale forever
I canÃÂ´t find you
Burning shadows all around
Among the dust
Ashes dancing in despair
I canÃÂ´t see but fire
Pale sky is falling down
Nightmares hunting me down
Where is my home
No there is no scape
Once you could stare at the stars
Dream with them and sing together in the shore
Seeing you smile again in peace
Distant shivers from the past
Your Tears echo in the abyss of dreams
I light up a candle for the tormented ones
I wish your souls rest forever in peace
Forever in peace
My chant trapped in cold walls
My tale covered with these dark clouds
oh why your beautyÃÂ´s gone
why you why you my love
I miss the blue of night
I long for the hope to dance
So blind to see but pain
Waterfall sings despair
Shreds of distant lullabies
Our promise died in vain
Missed sunrise will never come
These chains of sorrow
are too heavy to bear within
My silence screams inside
Trapped in a midnight beam
Shreds of distant lullabies
Our promise died in vain
From this nightmare
I will never wake ever
Unblessed crying oceans inside
My river of eternal mourn
Play the last serenade
Mistyeyed angel
Erase my fairy tale
Where was my guardian angel
To watch over me
There was no guardian angel
Where is my little princess
to draw our ship in the wind
ThereÃÂ´ll be no little princess
Trapped in a midnight beam
No one can hear my silence within
Alone in this world voice inside
IÃÂ´m already death my love
There is no strengh to run
Nor will to hide
Nothing canÃÂ´t save me from the past
Fear no more the heat o' the sun
nor the furious winter's rages
Thou thy worldly task hast done
home art gone and ta'en thy wages
Golden lads and girls all must
as chimneysweepers come to dust
No exorciser harm thee
Nor no witchcraft charm thee
Ghost unlaid forbear thee
Nothing ill come near thee
Quiet consummation have
And renowned be thy grave
Fear no more the frown o' the great
thou art past the tyrant's stroke
Care no more to clothe and eat
To thee the reed is as the oak
The sceptre learning physic
must all follow this and come to dust
No exorciser harm thee
Nor no witchcraft charm thee
Ghost unlaid forbear thee
Nothing ill come near thee
Quiet consummation have
And renowned be thy grave
Fear no more the lightning flash
nor the alldreaded thunderstone
Fear not slander censure rash
thou hast finish'd joy and moan
All lovers young all lovers must
consign to thee and come to dust
No exorciser harm thee
Nor no witchcraft charm thee
Ghost unlaid forbear thee
Nothing ill come near thee
Quiet consummation have
And renowned be thy grave
This is my dance of tragedy
Greed avarice
they are the dancers
My lifeÃÂ´s their stage
and my destruccion
is their work
They lie for money
Destroy lives for money
Souls come to me
Surround me with your magic
Dance of Tragedy
IÃÂ´ll hand to you
the keys to my paradise
I believe
IÃÂ´m your serf
I adore you
like a God
They lie for money
Destroy lives for Money
Souls come to me
Surround me with your magic
Dance of Tragedy
IÃÂ´ll hand to you
the keys to my paradise
My supossed saviour may my sad tears be
the daggers which go through your body
They lie for money
Destroy lives for money
Souls come to me
Surround me with your magic
Dance of Tragedy
IÃÂ´ll hand to you
the keys to my paradise
I believe
IÃÂ´m your serf
I adore you
A shine fell
walked in darkness
lighting up other lights
lost through time
Star from the sky
dont you cry more
dont let the darkness in the world
make you forget where you come from
The world is a mirror
you look at yourself in
you dont believe innocences been lost
Sad and small I walk
today I will be the sparkle of a lost reflection
maybe tomorrow I will shine
Star from the sky
dont you cry more
dont let the darkness in the world
make you forget where you come from
Only your delicate innocence
makes bloom true magic
hidden in others
I walk in shadows
today I will be the sparkle of a lost reflection
maybe tomorrow I will shine
Please Remember
Lost Light shine for us shine for you shine
Star from the sky
dont you cry more
dont let the darkness in the world
make you forget where you come from
Dreaming forever
theres no dust left to make me fly
Awake to fly
the moment has come to shine one last time
No ways to light up
today I will be the sparkle of a lost reflection
maybe tomorrow I will shine
Shine for you shine
The fleeting beauty of the days gone by
The longing thrill of a child soul dreamer eyes
The chances I found all along the way
The doors are now closed forevermore
Only a path leads to eternal bliss
Fading fading fading fading
Too frail for the fate I have pursued
Running back and forward and so forth
As always the mirror reflects infinite things
As infinite are the paths to long for
Now thereÃÂ´s just one what I get to see
Missing everything I couldnÃÂ´t find
Once I hold the key and once again
ItÃÂ´s gone
For the cold white snowflakes
Falling through the winter yearnings
Autumn hopes dancing as if fading
everywhere I run
IÃÂ´ll keep the promise never done to you
For the night we never had I cry
A thousand poems I didnÃÂ´t write
For you my one my lorn
Swimming in an ocean of stars
forward back and so forth
And hanging like the tear you never drop
The perpetual storm surrounding everything
Raging the waves and waving the sea
Thunderstorm of peace sweetest peace
Undone
Autumn hopes dancing as fading
Fading fading fading fading
For the cold white snowflakes
Falling through the winter yearnings
Autumn hopes dancing as if fading
everywhere I run
IÃÂ´ll keep the promise never done to you
For the night we never had I cry
A thousand poems I didnÃÂ´t write
For you my one my lorn
I Did never find the will to rhyme
the silence and the rose
And have beauty covering all the way back to you
my gone beloved
Since these pains werenÃÂ´t back to sadden me
Music save me
Grant the twilight a sigh of despair
A forgotten smile and drop a tear
For once we had the chance
To make it real
I feel cold this winter empty of you
Dreaming the embrace I didnÃÂ´t find
My last wordsMy farewell
Look around you grow your dreams
go raise your paradise
In the land Harmony a maiden called
F sharp decided to escape
from his village Stave evading
the guardian Sol key
The maiden travelled to a distant place
where a sage turned her into seed
From there the first musician
on Earth was born
My desire is your desire
Which stave would you like to be escaped from
and feel part of  the music of universe
Close your eyes then open your eyes
then you can see the note you have inside
When a musician borns
a musical note borns
When a musician dies
a musical note dies
In the land Harmony a maiden called
F sharp decided to escape
from his village Stave evading
the guardian Sol key
The maiden travelled to a distant place
where a sage turned her into seed
From there the first musician
on Earth was born
My desire is your desire
Which stave would you like to be escaped from
and feel part of  the music of universe
Building an stave
that keeps us all forever in time
To catch my hopes
to draw a note
to show my tears
music is my soul
music is my dream
In the land Harmony a maiden called
F sharp decided to escape
from his village Stave evading
the guardian Sol key
The maiden travelled to a distant place
where a sage turned her into seed
From there the first musician
on Earth was born
In my dreams
All my life
I pray
For Music
I visit I come in the form of friend
I'm sure tomorrow will blacken
In the past that I used to swim
procrastinate on all you can
This is the hard part bar the confusion
I genocide the parasites
This is the hurt that acquaintance brings
Not forgotten yet not preserved
Hell is the hello prone to a goodbye
This is not forgotten I bleed for feud again
I'm torn for nothing I need a cure for shit
another prototype of things we should've
seen The temptings of the opposite
It's eaten who I am It pauses plans It took my
Hands beaten Tool I am The fools and ham
but that's OK
Well I've fought to succeed against the cold
shoulders of misfortune and it's elusive
schemes
until I lost my wyn
Those Days come like napalm and burnt out
those things that make some and break some to
amount to shit
But I'm OK with it stapled to my head
Play god the wrong OK I think we know that
feeling deep down I'm not so scorned  just
Neuro fibro deformed
and stoop to novelty
The less I care the less I feel
Like it happy to remain who I am
you rancid ho
Wake up won't you enough of this
Who grants you now to laugh at this
Like it happy to be explain who I am
Like it happy to be the genital I am
This is vacuous
In truth I clone for a compensation for it's a
means to adhere to foes
But it's feeling great to date and I clone you
but Mines not mine to mime
Bungle Jazz funk combinations always see
applause but the plagiarisation is the flaw and
I'm compared to him
Yes I did dub him and mines not mine to mime
You gotta forge for all to see
The PCloned fraud in me
the lack of originality
The PCloned fraud that's me
a Mike Patton wanna be
I don't need complications of out being heard
We are completely opposites
You're out for siege beyond your vision
I lost the thing that hurts me most
If not to be I mourn conflicted
Rub it off with dismissal your sympathy is
We count the breeds and what we're missing
I liquidate me mighty missal
I'm saving it from awful places
We are all bored
Clog the day
Pride is plague
We don't want to out grow ourselves as long as
we are occupied and provided for
We aren't with feet the optimist
Without our greed there is no mission
How did we learn to love you
Now that we've learnt the outcome it's your kind
that's taught me hate
Nerp Nerp Nerp Nerp
Whore is not the name to give unto your traitor
copulator you're damned with the things you
can't aggress from your heart
Your forty highs to forty lows you thought on
best but guess again you've slipped to the point
of blunt and there is no return
You've worn your heart on your sleeve starched
now from the cruel outcomes It's your kind that
has taught me hate
For copulation or cunt distorts your ways and
coeds your patience you can't undo what's
done
A neppa nar per nar per neppa neppa neah
The Friendship that love destroyed was not the
intention or ploy the aftermath the pulp you
are beneath proud enigma you scar you can't
afford another error twice now already
agendered you can't be lord this fake con
tender for fake to the pulp you know you are
Best to scarand not to mention all the
mending It's the worst to learn or even know
that you beat the example to pulp
Not to mention all the mending
Not intended for the ending
Swift but fact an ear for lending
I welcome the beatings and the bendings
I'm bruised with what I've learnt and it's taken
me far
To pulp you've beaten me
The halt you seek in me
I'm beat to pulp unlord your pride
There's no feeling like when they break it off
Swept aside as your lesser halves your feelings
presence plays no part accept your fodder and
decor I'm there beside you to catch your
dimpled ass if it should fall I'm there besides
you
Stereo typed and under hyped I'm a thinkin'
that I'm done as your counterpart
Insert worth
Show them that you're not classed as an under
miner
You're lust compared to meit's all so
typical
Got to take the cause of the flaw and attempt to
remedy it It's best you take this fall on your
own I can not pretend to be lord to man or anti
judicial
Just hang your fate and abort
the little miles you stroll and dunce for every
thing that you can't mould
makes no or little difference to those
To feel is flaw
Got to take the cause of the flaw and attempt to
remedy it Yes I fear the grain and anti
properacy I have all along
Bless me with the vision that I want to be
Dunce with denial
fuck as fuck there is a smear in your case and
it's as fake as fuck I could not ever assort you
from the fake and funk there's that smirk in
applause that makes it fake as fuck rehearsed
and fake as fuck
There's that smirk in applause that makes it
fake as fuck I shepherded my pride that I'm not
and funk
Panorama  personas and you're as fake as
pains impressions that don't last a day so cake
on the fake and kill truth so cake on the fake
and charade well I find time to be shifty and
Nocturnal eyes reflects in me  the Mirrorland
So close the door behind my back  unmask reality
Reveal the secrets of thy heart  oh Mirrorland
In flesh and blood an empty shell of memories
Like mirror walls surrounding me I can not flee
sweet upon my lips  as I taste  the other side
Through doors where behind the unknown hides
searching pieces to the puzzle of my life
In Mirrorlandforever more
In blindless crawls through the maze of time
through the sinister dark the meander of dreams
My hear is cold every beat now hurts
As a sculpture of stone I rest
beholds my sepulchral rest
As a shadow of me from death torn free
to walk the path of dreams
Requiem  or an astral salute to her birth
The holy Virgin  Mary  Demonica
Her broken wings of innocence now ravenfeathered
Blood from angels tearing flesh to weep
And so she raise as a dragon ebonyveiled
In a Danse Macabre furies by her side
Goddess of plague and blight  Demonica
The maidens web as a deadly sheet
I lay my head upon her knees  to sleep
My naked eyes deceived my mind remains asleep
presence A demon from within
I am the frozen memories reflections of the past
In dreams I reveal myself to thee exploring
the meander of thy mind
thy life to be I whisper secrets in thy dreams
reality I am thy inner predacious entity
In a higher sphere I welcome thee to resign
thyself to me
Within my dream dominions I am supreme
Thy soul is mine to shape a naked canvas
to project my paintless drawings
my demonic fantasies upon
Colder than ice my black heart pounds
Within thy thoughts I am as god
I am thy inner voice from deep inside
I make my will be thine
Thy weakness makes me stronger thy thoughts
is mine to devour Within thy mind corrosion
my worms will gnaw
My tongue commands the legions of malicious
whispers from the dead the voices laughing
inside thy head
presence A demon from within
I will not rest until my nightmare  is thine
to within darkness dwell
A demon from within
to strengthen my heart
Dead winter enthrones
Vexilla regis produent Inferni
As a phantom of night I ride by thy side
The Archangels revocation of the dead
The apocalyptic revelation
The arrival of plague and death
The Armageddon revolution  to come
Astral sparks of fire descending to ablaze
The landscapes drained by sulphur rain
from the canopy licked by flames
Shadows walks the earth to ravish life and glee
Claimant  the silence  as blood to my ears
The black sun is falling into the abyss
with the lakes of dark blood to merge
The sky is aflame when I ride through the night
as a phantom through fire I fly
Armageddon The final redemption of wrath
Dies Irae
the putrid stench of withered flesh  weeping
to drown as sinners in sulphur steam drenched
in the damp bloodless vein of PhlegethonBath
Sculptured to be
I am the barren one and many are her sons
Chaos Gaia arose from the shadows to spawn
the most ancient tremendous gods
the tenebrous waves of Nyx with silver sparks
like ice and diamonds she strews
From the Olympus heights the palace of gods
to flood the oceans united in grand deluge
All is dead an ocean lies vast and silent
The bloodstained Parnassus above the ocean
to behold a new aeon as Eos raise
The rebirth of Chaos life and plague
another dream to flourish in the Arcadian soil
An ode to the undead the divine and forlorn
Shadows spawned in the deep ghastly creatures
emerging from the surgy ocean so black
I now can see no longer blind
Bloodthirsty tongues speak within me
Incubi wrath within my dreams
yet hidden from the blinded mind
With tired eyes as the bewitchment to fade
I'm able to see beyond the masquerade
The Sirens hands now harlot claws that shreds
my naked skin to taste my innocent flesh
Moonlight jewelry in her ebony hair
the blood of the angel of death
Like the whispers of night through the shadows
A silhouette towards the drama of nightfall
in silence I remain  my time will come
I drown myself in the fountains of time
I hear the sound of angels weeping
Nocturnal voices through the shadows of dreams
towards the twilight draws me closer to thee
Thy mirage beckon me to see the unseen
a fleshless spirit upon the moonlit scene
the blood of the angel of death
Like the whispers of night through the shadows
The winternight fullmoon proclaims our marriage
our funeral romance under the shadow of death
As lovers we lay while the darkness we sway
As silhouettes wrapped in somniferous plague
I desire for thee oh pestiferous queen
amorous bride in lustfilled sensuous dreams
Together with thee in phantasmagorian sleep
By darkness caught in its smothering snare
Lifeless we lay under the corpsecandle flare
But the fire still burns in our hearts
Persephone I crave for thee as I slowly dies
As lovers we lay while the darkness we sway
As silhouettes wrapped in somniferous plague
I desire for thee oh pestiferous queen
amorous bride in lustfilled sensuous dreams
Together with thee in phantasmagorian sleep
accreted in our death we lay
With ebonyfeathered wings through the dark I fly
I am the nightspirit
Like a shade upon the starspangled sky
Alone like a voyager of dreams  unknown
I fly away  through the shimmering moonlight
Never again to spread its tainted light
upon the flooded shores of Eden
Never more  will the sun arise from the horizon
All is dark and silent
Enrobed in black  above the meadows of Eden
The moon reflects upon my  somber wings
So endless dark the aeons to come will be
I soar into another dream
I am as one with the night that burns in me
From the gardens of stars a carillion serenade
invites me to the twilight invisible ballet
Dancing with ghosts I darkly parade
as a shade in their grotesque act of masquerade
Spattered in blood my angels I deign to drown
Dei gratiaCarnifex
The vast is thine  without form and void
Another dawn a new beginning
Another breath before the dark
A spectral masquerade in eerie veils of dark
Demon claws streched out for me
The void is dark and so is thee
behind the shield of mirrorglass
With broken wings in the dust they crawl
Another dream De profundis clamavi
Off with there heads
1 2 3
Breaking all silence
Screaming my heart out
Wish you were hear to see my up rise
Standing with my head high
Try to bring me down
I don't fall easy just wait and you'll see
I am stronger now than ever before
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I am stronger now than ever before
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Breaking all silence
Screaming my heart out
Wish you were hear to see my up rise
Standing with my head high
Try to bring me down
I don't fall easy just wait and you'll see
I am stronger now than ever before
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
I am stronger now than ever before
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
The silence of the day
The calming of the night
Helps to ease the pain
That's flowing through my veins
The silence of the day
The calming of the night
Helps to ease the pain
That's flowing through my veins
I won't go down
Without a fight
I refuse to be brought down by you
I won't go down
Without a fight
Never in a thousand years
Did I ever think that i would hear
You wanna go on and live your own life
You wanna break free and be with out me
Life goes on
Life goes on
What made you think that it would be so hard
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Goodbye
Never in a thousand years
Did I ever think that i would hear
I share my empathy cause i never really care
You wanna go on and live your own life
You wanna break free and be with out me
Back away from me
Back away from me
I didn't need you before
What makes you think I do now
Well I don't
Never in a thousand years
Did I ever think that i would hear
I share my empathy cause i never really care
You wanna go on and live your own life
You wanna break free and be with out me
Take one good look around
We shoot we shoot to kill
We aim we aim to please
Nothing is what it seems
We're like an open book
No one can ever read
Take us for who we are
Never for what we've done
Take one good look around
We shoot we shoot to kill
We aim we aim to please
Nothing is what it seems
We're like an open book
No one can ever read
Take us for who we are
Never for what we've done
This is our last reason
This time we spend
Sound fills the room
Our time begins
Lets break the barrier
Between whats real and not
Take one good look around
We shoot we shoot to kill
We aim we aim to please
Nothing is what it seems
We're like an open book
No one can ever read
Do you hear the silence
It's stronger than all your words
Stare right through me
you think i care
But now the wind blew down the door
No grace could break the raging storm
taking wrong when we go right
But now the wind blew down the door
everyone knows the truth
no grace could break the raging storm
will come out in a fight
good intentions take a toll
to never bear whats on my soul
only the lasting breath I'll take
keep close your life's at stake
good intentions take a toll
to never bear whats on my soul
only the lasting breath I'll take
keep close your life's at stake
Stare right through me
you think i care
But now the wind blew down the door
No grace could break the raging storm
taking wrong when we go right
But now the wind blew down the door
everyone knows the truth
no grace could break the raging storm
will come out in a fight
Why cant the world spin around me
Don't run away
from the letdown of the everyday
don't run away
from the letdown of the everyday
Stare right through me
you think i care
But now the wind blew down the door
No grace could break the raging storm
taking wrong when we go right
But now the wind blew down the door
everyone knows the truth
no grace could break the raging storm
will come out in a fight
Is there no sleep
For the light hearted soul
For the wicked
The dice will roll
Is there  no sleep
Is there
No sleep
is there no is there no
is there no
Sleep
but now I'll never hear your lies
the pain I felt was just a moment in time
and I know all these things will never change
serenity's mine
the fire burns inside
don't have to see the greed in your eyes
and I know all these things will never change
and you don't feel bad
'for all these things I've kept inside
for all these things that I've denied
you'll never get my soul
for all the times you told a lie
to get your way just like a child
you will not be my demise'
a cruel misfortune
a cruel misfortune
a cruel misfortune
a cruel misfortune
through the mist I call
like a shadow I descend
with raven wings I devour
caressing the night in bitter moonlight
I call to thee the eternal
lost in sweet oblivion
cant find your way home
wait for your deliverance
a place to rest your soul
taste my cold deceit
burn in my flames eternal
I cover you in my misery
forlorn you'll never see the light
I call to thee the eternal
lost in sweet oblivion
restless is your soul
lord of your demise
in this limbo you'll eternally roam
forever you will roam
in this suffering I revel in your torment
I call to thee the eternal
you told me that you'd never walk away
leave me to face my fears
your actions contradict the words you say
you lose me on the edge of a word
but your all I've ever known
falling from your cradle of grace
I cant believe you let me fall today
leave me to face myself
your eyes they tell me what you try to say
another love has died
but your all I've ever known
falling from your cradle of grace
falling from your cradle again
but your all I've ever known
falling from your cradle of grace
I see it in your eyes
falling from your cradle again
I taste it in your tears
falling from your cradle again
enter the depths of your anguished dreams
I await you the silent the divine
set my mind adrift with a glance
endless is the isolation I await you
shadows dance in endless sympathy
to the light of treacherous souls
feel the ravens as they tear your flesh
in this sombre light awaken arise
awaken arise awaken arise
endless is this pain
silent are your lonely cries
no one sees your silent glance
lost in emptiness
emptiness
renounce your flesh with awakened desire
see the reflection of your withered soul
I await you in this endless trance
in this sombre light awaken arise
awaken arise awaken arise
endless is this pain
silent are your lonely cries
no one sees your silent glance
lost in emptiness silent is your pain
enter the depths of your anguished dreams
I await you the silent the divine
set my mind adrift with a glance
endless is the isolation I await you
endless is this pain
silent are your lonely cries
waiting for eternity
endless is this isolation
I lay upon your golden wings silent and divine
I fall before your gaze never quite the same
black serenity I'll never let you go
I dream of sanity a time to let it go
black serenity your arms around my neck
in a shadow a silhouette together we are all
'before me I see the beauty of angels
as her hair cascades down her face
I hear her voice here in this sanctuary
in these arms a river to drown'
black serenity hear her call to me
black serenity before the dawn we sleep
before the light of dawn
I will be reborn
to taste the night and know
its everlasting ecstasy
when the seven fires burn
your beauty I adorn
in a crimson sacrifice
my blood upon the thorns
for all the souls that burn
on bloodied knees I crawl
veiled in a shadow
I transcend this shame
falling on cold hands
falling on the words that bind me
I'm lost in emptiness I'm lost in you
I'm lost in emptiness I'm lost in you
I'm lost in emptiness I'm lost in you
I'm lost in emptiness I'm lost in
and to the ones with empathy for the fallen few
mind control is out of control
total control has lost control
I woke up drenched head to toe in sweat
I dreamed of war while safely in my bed
two thousand miles away the fires rage
horror in my mind I turn the page
my thoughts at dawn as the red sun rose
the blood that spilled in the redness shows
who did the sun shine on for one last time
how many have fallen while I soundly slept
breathed their last words as their children wept
who did the sun shine on for one last time
deceptive propaganda games poison till its done
receptive like an open wound yielded to the sun
remembrance scars
and still you don't see
the demise the suffering
death drawing us near
our doom fueled by your fear
I see the devil in the eyes of god
feel his flesh against your burning skin
wallow in your pity filth and sin
cant you see that all hope is lost
we exist in a godless world
mankind consumes itself
we're tearing a our own flesh
commemorate the misery
I see the devil in the eyes of god
feel his flesh against your burning skin
wallow in your pity filth and sin
cant you see that all hope is lost
The greatest of my dreamy load
Crossing a blood red sky streaked with dust
Between the shooting stars
I'm ready to rush
Fuel my elation under a meteor shower
Our climax closer to a burning sun
Let's go higher to shine
The greatest of my dreamy load
Soaring over a starry field
Let's go higher to shine
And take off through the rocket smoke
Laying beyond the stratosphere
Leave the ground till we probe
The depths of our yearning
We're only passenger
To the far side of the time
Spreading straight up
No return to the earth
Slicing the air Burning fast Fire lines
Let's go higher to shine
The greatest of my dreamy load
Soaring over a starry field
Let's go higher to shine
And take off through the rocket smoke
Laying beyond the stratosphere
Leave the ground till we probe
The depths of our yearning
We're only passenger
To the far side of the time
Soaring over a starry field
And laying beyond the stratosphere
Let's go higher to shine
The greatest of my dreamy load
Soaring over a starry field
Let's go higher to shine
And take off through the rocket smoke
Laying beyond the stratosphere
I need to keep walking
Walking and never stop
My craving is waking up till it dies once more
There's only one place
Where I can lose myself
I need to go astray
To the dreamer's hideaway
And I'm still suspended
Like a neutral species
From the possible to the real
Nothing to keep me on the ground
That's why I'm here
That's why
There's only one place
Where I can lose myself
I need to go astray
To the dreamer's hideaway
My first step down
Makes me realize I'm here
The first step down
It's not an ordinary place
Nothing to keep me on the ground
I'm fully suspended
Nothing to keep my longing down
In the wake of my need
A world to see with blinding light
Walk and never stop
Never
Till my heart falls to the floor
There's only one place
Where I lose myself
So lead me astray
To the dreamer's hideaway
Thin lines circle slowly
Endless cycles collide
Bodies melt in twisting
Set your mind in motion
Lava flows in your veins
One eye in the spiral
The essential is invisible
The superficial too
A body in eruption
Hostile deep and sad
You're my edible poison
A shiver down my spine
Come and dance for me
Dance
Until you fill the space
A constant temptation
On the edge of a fall
It's time to feed your addiction
In your search for the void
The twisting of your flesh
Contortion of the mind
Face the fear to feel what's fake
And walk on the wire
Come on and dance for me
Dance
Until you fill the space
Thin lines circle slowly
Endless cycles collide
Bodies melt in twisting
Set your mind in motion
Come and dance for me
Dance
Until you fill the space
Hope will crystallize
Dance
Until you feel the space
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Drifting in an ocean of tears
Some rocks appear at the surface
And voices call me from the abyss
I can't resist to this delight
The taste of your deadly kiss
The water's so bright I surrender
Profoundly into the night
With the siren's song
Lost in your kingdom
Where tales become true
A fate prey to your divine beauty
Then you consume me
Beneath the surface
You entice me with you bewitching might
I can't resist to this delight
The taste of your deadly kiss
The water's so bright I surrender
Profoundly into the night
With the siren's song
When stories turn to life
Here I am in paradise
A prey to your sacrifice
The water is so bright
You entice me with you bewitching might
Here I am in paradise
A prey to your sacrifice
When stories turn to life
I'll give myself to you entirely
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Profoundly into the night
I can't resist to this delight
The taste of your deadly kiss
The water's so bright I surrender
Profoundly into the night
With the siren's song
Here I am
A slave of a new disorder
Trapped inside a labyrinth
Condemned to wander among my worst fears
Anywhere
There's nothing without solution
Still I've to discover mine
Looking forward to my resurrection
Hear the crying corridors
The secret of whispering walls
I'm awake
Pain makes me aware I'm alive
Reminds me of my condition
Am I a prisoner of this universe
Every night
I dream of a well of light
Clarifying my gloomy hope
Revealing the path of my own fight
Hear the crying corridors
The secret of whispering walls
Here I am
Never ending loop
I am the target
I must reach the center
It's my only way
Condemned to wander among my worst fears
Here I am
A slave of a new disorder
Trapped inside a labyrinth
Condemned to wander among my worst fears
Hear the crying corridors
The secret of whispering walls
Never ending loop
I am the target
I must reach the center
It's my only way
Video
Not one day
Goes without leaving trace
Save my screams
It's time to let the monster rise
Hell is not real
Feel the fire in your hands
Feed my flames
This strong core inside me
From the illusion to reality
Bring to light what can only be seen at night
And back from the brink
Die to be reborn once again
Tirelessly
Rise from the ashes
Crawl under my skin
Keep me wild
In metamorphosis
I feel the monster rise
Strangely sealed in a violent grace
It's a new beginning
Die to be reborn once again
Tirelessly
Rise from the ashes
From the illusion to reality
Tirelessly
And back from the brink
Crawl under my skin
Keep me wild
In metamorphosis
I feel the monster rise
Hell is not real
Feel the fire in your hands
Feed my flames
This strong core inside me
Crawl under my skin
Keep me wild
Not one day
Goes without leaving trace
Save my screams
It's time to let the monster rise
The memories take up space
They're boundless
Sometimes I invoke them for tomorrow
And this solar eclipse freezes my open eyes
No detail is insignificant
Always on the run
I run alongside
Am I a free electron
When you are on my ride
There are no rules to defy the gravity law
Rooted in the moment I'm made of steam and smoke
I feel like a giant freed of his weight
Ready to rope the moon
In absolute control
Broken reality
I'm high in the air
Am I a free electron
When you are on my ride
In absolute control
Deeper in my thoughts
No detail is insignificant
I can hear the inaudible
Rooted in the moment I'm made of steam and smoke
There are no rules to defy the gravity laws
Take shape against the current
With the smile of the wind
Then I am free among the big black clouds
Even deeper in my own thoughts
Buried in a perceptible amnesia
No gravity laws
Among the big black clouds
Rooted in the moment I'm made of steam and smoke
Take shape against the current
With the smile of the wind
Then I am free
Even deeper in my own thoughts
Buried in a perceptible amnesia
Always on the run
I run alongside
Am I a free electron
When you are on my ride
Back to stay
Back to remain
Back to feed on this sweet and common state
The worst is over
The best is yet to come
Today nothing will ever be the same
I've nothing to do outside
Back to freeze myself in this trip
Back to unravel my own mysteries
The worst is over
The best is yet to come
Today nothing will ever be the same
I feel so complete
On the edge of fullness
From the land of living
I make up for lost time
Today nothing will ever be the same
Connected
Dismantling the structure of my harmony
Today nothing will ever be the same
Connected
Deep in the pleasure of feeling sad
Nestling in an emotional pit
An indestructible happiness
I've nothing to do outside
Deep in the pleasure of feeling sad
I've nothing to do outside
From the land of living
I make up for lost time
Come to life
Make stories come alive
You're only a vibration
Just a friction in the air
Go ahead
It's time for you to play
A craving runs to you
Cause you're a friction in the air
Ride the rythm flow
Let the music sound
All over the road
The march is on
Raise your voice
Embrace the sound of noise
Let yourself be carried away
By this slow and massive wave
Come and sing
Dance on the groove machine
A strong pulse in your hands
Like a slow and massive wave
Ride the rythm flow
Let the music sound
All over the road
The march is on
Shape the melody suiting your moods
Shape the melody suiting your groove
One finger snaps
A strong pulse from the inside
A friction in the air
Has come to life
Let the music sound
Make stories come alive
Make and come alive
Ride the rythm flow
Let the music sound
All over the road
The march is on
The days are numbered
Drop by drop
Always different
But so similar
Some birds remain
Waiting for the rest
Everything doesn't happen by chance
It's another world
Where silence is word
And the freedom is free
At the end of the bridge
Hit
Move the lines
To draw your landscape
It's time for you to join me on the other side
It's another world
Where silence is word
And the freedom is free
This world will be exactly
As you want it to be
At the end of the bridge
Hit
Move the lines
To draw your landscape
It's time for you to join me on the other side
It's another world
Where silence is word
And the freedom is free
This world will be exactly
As you want it to be
At the end of the bridge
I've been hiding in the basement of my mind
If I don't keep moving
My feet will fall asleep
It gets a little harder
When the snow's so deep
What I take I take on the chin
They keep asking hey what's wrong with him
I look alone
But there's a crowd I see
And I know you can't tell
Which one is me
If I don't keep moving
My feet will fall asleep
It gets a little harder
When the snow's so deep
Waiting for my help
Hope you can hold your breath
Not doing anything that's what I do best
Which one is me
I look alone
But there's a crowd I see
And I know you can't tell
Which one is me
Feeling shellshocked
Barbedwire I'm torn apart
Warheads dead ends
Parties only we attend
The runaround out of ground
Your god damned sympathy
Wears me down
I've spent my life
Reaching out to empty air
Slipping faster all the time
But no one seems to care
Concrete breaks my fall
Trouble ten stories tall
Sunshine I can't sleep
Just like my life on TV
Church bells drowning me out
My ears ring your favorite sound
Clench my fists to strands
That really don't exist
I try not to fool myself
But still I cant resist
I've spent my life
Reaching out to empty air
Slipping faster all the time
But no one seems to care
Clench my fists to strands
That really don't exist
I try not to fool myself
But still I cant resist
Blood born my loss
Nailed to more than
Just a cross
Driven hard brick fence
My twenty first second chance
Shellshocked
Barbedwire
Warheads
Your god damned sympathy
Concrete ten stories tall
Feeling shellshocked
Empty air
Empty air
Another lamp with the bulb broken out
You can't see in here but I know how
I know glass is made of sand
But I see right through enough to understand
Downfall delivery
At any speed
You'll scare yourself creeping up on me
Hit myself hard in the head
Thought I could hold the hit instead
I burnt myself
Pick a window because now you're leaving
Do you like hospital food  You will
Can your mother sew  Have her stitch' this
Things fade away that's what they tell
Look in the water can't see myself so well
Hoping for a place that safe
You got me instead
I've been waiting around all day
Just to see shadows spread
I'm hiding in the basement of my mind
It's cold and dark in here
Just what I thought
Learned my lessons well
These stitches keeping count
Going under is all I got down
Pick a window because now you're leaving
Do you like hospital food  You will
Can your mother sew  Have her stitch' this
Hey kids where you been
I hope not killing again
What's that I see in your coat
What's that scar from on your throat
Fill yourself ruin anybodies life
I smoke a lot but never got that high
On life putting on a price
Not worth anything take what you like
I hope you like what you see
So you there's no reason to point that gun at me
I'll fix it all with a gun
Right or wrong can't be undone
A bullet changes everything
Hear the echo of the shots that ring
Should have only had to look
Through the playground bars
Never thought what you'd end up seein'
Would be so hard
I'll fix it all with a gun
Right or wrong can't be undone
A bullet changes everything
Hear the echo of the shots that ring
I'll fix it all with a gun
Right or wrong can't be undone
A bullet changes everything
Hear the echo of the shots that ring
If it were oh just gone
If it just wasn't there
Would I disappear
Would I even care
Avoid in the arrangement
A blindspot in my mind
A space in what's important
A black hole of some kind
It walks right beside me
Invisible to most
Not an apparition not the holy ghost
Sdumble two another day
Not knowing what is wrong
Not stolen not lost or broken
Been missing for so long
Can't quite find it in me
Fading pulse can I survive
My heart fails me again
Flatlined
But still alive
It walks right beside me
Invisible to most
Not an apparition not the holy ghost
Dragging it behind me
Can't hold on any more
Slips through my fingers
And scatters on the floor
It hovers right above me
As I move from door to door
When I hang my head in shame
It lies then on the floor
Searching for what I may never know
It's missing I can feel it
Can't just let it go
When I reach out
I can feel it
It walks right beside me
Invisible to most
Not an apparition not the holy ghost
It hovers right above me
As I move from door to door
When I hang my head in shame
It lies there on the floor
Talks from inside me silent to most
Not the voice of god
Not the only ghost
Dragging it behind me
Can't hold on any more
Slips through my fingers
And scatters on the floor
It lies there on the floor
Missing
What's this conscience with claws
The protest without the cause
Straight through drawing to the air
Run you over to get it here
Lost in my own insides
Any tool to fix it right
Never free from myself
Always running from myself
Can't see me in my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Forget about feelings use you like they use me
Can't  even see you in the daylight
Fanatic full of facts tonight
Nothing's free
Anything corrosive magnet
Dissolving everything within
Can't see me in my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Blindside they see my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Got what I wanted to know displaced
Override guy reason to win
Winning's not for everyone
The darkest dirt again
If I turn on my lights out
I won't have to clean my house
I won't have to clean my house
Can't see me in my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Blindside they see my blindside
Stoppin tomorrow tonight
Can't see me in my blindside
Stopping tomorrow tonight
Blindside they see my blindside
Stoppin tomorrow tonight
Newspaper blanket covers my view
But I still get the story through
The more people that I meet
The less friends that I keep
Words roll off my tongue like spit
I reighin again get used to it
The dust you kicked about
Ended up in my mouth
I don't care what they say
As long as they remember me
What they all think of me now is
All that I'll ever be
I'm sinking taking everyone down
Remember what I spoke
I'm throwing in the towel now
To stuff it down your throat
I don't care what they say
As long as they remember me
What they all think of me now is
All that I'll ever be
I'm sinking taking everyone down
Remember what I spoke
I'm throwing in the towel now
To stuff it down your throat
I don't care what they say
As long as they remember me
What they all think of me now is
All that I'll ever be
I'm sinking taking everyone down
Remember what I spoke
I'm throwing in the towel now
To stuff it down your throat
Spit on lost reality
Canived underneath the sun
Had to go and drive the needle
Of my mind right through my heart
Absence of thought disturbs me
I've seen me in a dream
I've lost me in a dream
Longing like a new widow
Wanting to rejoin
Force fed dosed on reality
Indian giver be true or trade away
I've liked me in a dream
I've loved me in a dream
Quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back
To where I've never been
Let the flesh
Instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Spend my time counting
The snowflakes in my mind
I never show even though
You know I know the way
I know the way
I've seen me in a dream
I've lost me in a dream
Quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back
To where I've never been
Let the flesh
Instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Sitting here waiting
For myself
I'm late again
That's always certain
As long as I make it back
Make it back
I'm living me in a dream
I'm lost me in a dream
Quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back
To where I've never been
Let the flesh
Instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Quit wasting my time
Why can't I get back
To where I've never been
Let the flesh
Instruct the mind
Destructive signs
Let the flesh intruct the mind
I come to you for guidance
I come to you for help
You just see a bright idea
To benefit yourself
You know that there's no risk
Nothing you should dread
On to your deception
This view of wool delights my head
Finally I realize what you're all about
Time to pull out all the stops
Don't make me spell it on
All I know is what I'd do
If I was in your shoes
Nothing close to what you've done
Nothing close to what you do
Tell me that I'm failing
Hold me under thumb
Pay off my emotions made
Blind deaf dumb
Another hole in the bucket
Where it's wet you're gonna slide
Can't walk down the middle without
Slipping off the side
Smoked out peeled back unearthed
The real you washes ashore
I come to your for guidance
I come to call a truce
You take the rope I climb and tie at in a noose
Ask my permission
To ask my permission
Don't even take a breath unless I know
Tell me that I'm failing
Hold me under thumb
Pay off my emotions made
Blind deaf dumb
Another hole in the bucket
Where it's wet you're gonna slide
Can't walk down the middle without
Slipping off the side
Smoked out peeled back unearthed
The real you washes ashore
I come to you for guidance
I come to call a truce
You take the rope I climb and tie at in a noose
Finally I realize what you're all about
Now pack your shit and get the fuck out
You will make it up to me
You will make amends
Will will not be family
And we can not be friends
I realize what you're all about
Now pack your shit and get the fuck out
Tell me that I'm failing
Hold me under thumb
Pay off my emotions made
Blind deaf dumb
Another hole in the bucket
Where it's wet you're gonna slide
Can't walk down the middle without
Slipping off the side
Smoked out peeled back unearthed
The real you washes ashore
Living on your own again
What's gonna keep you clean this time
But how you wear your skin so hard
And breath that turpentine
You're not her only hurting son
But her favorite one it seems
You thought you'd die
When you heard goodbye
And sank your dreams
You're just confused like the rest of us
About your next meal
Left mistakes everywhere
For the whole word to feel
It comes around once more
Get drunk again before we go
I wish I'd heard his last dying words
Last dying words
My train of thought gets slow
I stole the money I need
Why I'm never even know
You need prayer more than
Anyone I ever knew
But save a prayer for later
To get a drink or two
Remember when we all said
That we could stop any time
Poets tell how gods fell
Through his last dying words
Last dying words
My train of thought gets slow
Why I'll never even know
You need prayer more than
Anyone I ever knew
But save a prayer for later
To get a drink or two
Remember when we all said
That we could stop any time
Poets tell how gods fell
Through his last dying words
You let me down  when I was on my knees
You made me beg  you made me creep
You made me loose  and I cant stand the defeat
You made me feel  and I felt alive
You made me run  until we ran out of time
I cant say goodbye  without regret
Cause I still believe
In the love that we had
I remember the time
And all the moments we had
I remember your voice
And the words you said
I remember the touch
When I caressed your skin
Your sweet embrace
That took me in
I slipped into a state of neglect
I wasted my time with worthless affairs
I dont feel  Ive no more feelings to give
I deluded myself that I dont need you no more
For hours I cried  no more tears to shed
I still feel alone when Im going to bed
This road has taken me
So Far from where I was before  before
Moments of solitude
How many miles have passed  under my feet
Under my feet
Moments of clarity
Without the shadow of a doubt
Beyond any doubt
You shelter me in your arms
Im heading for the horizon
I know  I can rely on you
Were walking  together  on this road  forever
Forever forever
Forever and a day
You know whats on my mind
You know what I disguise
Youve always been  my closet friend
All the time  you are near
You take away my fear
Everything that drags me down
When Im in desperate straits
You are the one who waits
Who welcomes me  with open arms
Mosh
I want to reach  a new horizon
I want to find  my destiny
I want to reach  a new horizon
It was time  for change
I needed a break
From my life
I needed some time
On my own
To break away from my past
I went away I lost myself
I let go
Before I became absorbed in thoughts
All these miles of solitude
All these miles so far from home
In the endlessness of time
In the middle of nowhere
I found rest and inner peace
I found the one I was looking for
The one I was looking for
I got rid  of my thoughts
Of everything  that pulled me down
I needed some time
On my own
To break away from my past
Lets go
I have a hard  furrow to plough
I am past  my sellby date
Time hangs heavy  on my hands
I deconstruct
Bygone days
Fragments of my past
Fragments of my past
Save me
And take me away
Save me
Before I go astray
Save me
Im waiting the for the wind
To carry me
To carry me back home
My thoughts are floating
Like leaves in the air
All these thoughts
That burdened my soul
Are swept aside
While the pain steals away
I try to let go
And time will tell
The struggle comes  to an end
Im at the end  the end of my rope
The struggle comes  to an end
I behold
Distorted pictures
That made up my past
That made up my past
You are afraid  of being yourself
Your spiritual abyss  is covered with leaves
Leaves from braches  that once were alive
Leaves full of life  dancing in the wind
Embracing the wind
Every single emotion  means nothing to you
Times and moments  you went through
Never satisfied  with the things at hand
You sail your ships  to nomansland
You are driven by  unquenchable thirst
You carry your heart  underneath a coat
A heart full of doubts  full of remorse
A heart full of sorrow  that grows cold
A massive grindstone  that aches in your chest
That aches in your chest
Come on lets go
You have a hard row to hoe
Youre not alone  we care for you
Dont surrender without a fight
Your mum is there  all through the night
Dont give up  and never say die
Its still too early  to wave goodbye
You take the rough with the smooth
Were damn  proud of you
Dont let down your lads
Because they stick to you  like wax
You've got all your life
In front of you
All your friends
Are waiting for you
We keep our fingers crossed
We wish you were herewith us
We know you have big shoes to fill
Dont give up  and try to stem the tide
Aim for the good things in your life
Dont lose heart  dont lose your faith
Dont give up  and never say die
Its still too early  to wave goodbye
Come and spent some time with us
Cause we are missing you every day
Motionless  I cannot move
I only recall  how it felt before
Confined to my bed  I cannot escape
I want to move on  all in vain
The passing days  are all the same
I want to move on  but I cant shout
Trapped in inactivity
My bodys locked my mind is free
My mind is free  Im paralyzed shout
All my thoughts are passing by
I want to leave but cannot die
I cannot die  Im paralyzed shout
Im counting hours
Im counting days
Locked in my body
I dream away
A glance to the left
A glance to the right
The world seems out of reach
Im feeling trapped
Inside of my head
But there no way out
The passing days  are all the same
I want to move on  but I cant shout
You live for the day
You never cared about
Anyone else than yourself
You cosy me along
You drop the veil
And stab me right in the back
Im fed up with you
On that you can be sure
I wipe the smirk of your faceyou fucking moron
I clear the air
Mind my words
Get out of my way
Get out of my sight
I have a mind on my own
I have a lot to say  to say
I have my own way  own way
Cause I have a goal in my life
I know what I stand for
I dont give a shit about you
And what you think about me
Fuck off
Fuck you
From time to time
I ask myself
Why I turn my back on you
Your selfishness
Your carelessness
You are making me sick
Im feed up with you
On that you can be sure
I wipe the smirk of your faceyou fucking moron
I clear the air
Mind my words
Get out of my way
Get out of my sight
I have a mind on my own
I have a lot to say  to say
I have my own way  own way
Cause I have a goal in my life
I know what I stand for
I dont give a shit about you
And what you think about me
Fuck off
Fuck you
You reflectÃÂÃÂ you think about your life
You dont know  if its worth to fight
You feel trapped  within a desperate world
You are scared  of all the things that hurt
Dont you see  that there is joy in life
All I see  are your desperate eyes
You bury your face  in your hands
Embrace the day  before its gone
Because tomorrow  might never come
Believe in your dreams  and make them come true
Use your time
Begin to turn
Carry on
Dont leave your life undone
You regret  your past and bygone times
Cant you see  that there is more in life
Dont give in  dont miss the light of day
Trust in you  and you will make your way
Cant you see  that there is joy in life
All I see  are your desperate eyes
Im angry dissatisfied
The feelings I try to hide
Haunt me  Every single night
Im lonely  time goes by
Im sorry  but cannot cry
What is  wrong with me
Memories memories
Memories of better days
Memories memories
Memories of better days
Im dreaming  endless nights
Denying  that youre right
Recalling  who I used to be
Im screaming furiously
Im begging  on my knees
For something  I will never reach
Times have changed
A burning wound
That always bleeds
That never heals
No need to disguise
We know our lies
We know our truth that hurts
No need to pretend
Were facing the end
Of the love  that we shared
How these stories carry on
Now that our past is gone
Every day I turn away
From a love thats in decay
Everything I could have done
Everything we lost and won
We are going separate ways
Forgetting all the dreadful days
All the dreadful days
No need to complain
We know its in vein
We know our truth  that hurts
No need to be sad
Cause all we had
Are memories we share
I`m waking up on the floor
With a burning headache like never before
Narcotized by alcohol
Im lying there  I cant move no more
Value memories on my mind
Im try to think of better times
Im alone and youre not here
Youre gone and Im left in fear
If I remembered yesterday
If I remembered where you stay
If I remembered what went wrong
Id try to change myself for you
I see your face before my eyes
I see you sad and I see you cry
I see everything  I did to you
I cannot belive  what I do
Alcohol has dimned my mind
You had enough of this sacrifice
Im alone and youre not here
Youre gone and Im left in fear
Are  you coming my way
Do you believe
In the things that is say
In the things that I do
Do you hear what Im trying to say
What the future holds for me
All the things awaiting me
I am open for whats to come
Cause all my life has just begun
Now  I live
Now  I breathe
Now  I feel
Now I feel that Im alive
Now  I live
Now  I breathe
Now  I feel
Now I feel that Im alive
Are  you sharing my dream
Do you believe
That we will move on
That we will be free
Do you hear what Im trying to say
Are you inside provider or am I
Immersed in all the darkness and decay
Denied the sleep to dream myself away
Said I was bright too sensitive to fly
Can't tell you why you don't already know
He reins the horse for those I cannot see
Will I like him a gallant rider be
The skin is pale the sunken eyes are slow
Photographs fingerprints fragile refugee
Higher rise fire in the sky society
Can I hold on can I believe in
All the things you are
There's no sane in chaos reigns in Subterranea
Cadillac heart attack back of this beyond
Pusher king TV queen accommodating blonde
Surgeon carves the matching halves
The blindfold leads the blind
Can I hold on  I cannot count them
All the things you are
And caught within chemical rain
My dreams have turned against me
And fatally have fenced me in
Above me cold light and below me over all
The time I've lost how can I know
So I keep forgetting what I am half recalling
On a bed of fallen flowers
Hold me now as I was held before
Powerhouse sacred vows trigger happy punk
Driven by hidden eyes and figure hugging junk
Heaven knows if I'm close am I unreleased
Can I hold on can I belong to
All the things you are
There's no sane in chaos reigns in Subterranea
Sightless he watches the columns collide
As he wanders the canyons relentlessly wide
Empires are burning the rain cuts his skin
And in every direction the sound closes in
Time only time have I
And already I'm not okay
He falls in with the unwashed and unfed
In these extraordinary lanes
He is blind again unaware still
From the greatest height and to the furthest end
Without association he will bend
And walking with the wounded old and thin
Made to be paraded bring the misfit in
How to overpower the avenues of steel
In my illusion what of this is real
Sleepless incidental what I really need
Is how to now avoid the full stampede
I'm only taking time
And I'm not where I want to be now
Do you seek enlightenment
Are you to frightened to speak
Short of experience
Here where the flesh is so weak
Trust in these hands
Let them attend to you
We understand
We all intend for you
To stand among friends
Are you remembering
Do I revive your neglect
My one
A price must be paid for your sin
And I'm here to collect
All that you are
Is all that you'll ever be
Unless on your hands and knees
You put all your faith in me
Leave me alone
I don't belong here
I'm not your candidate
Guaranteed failsafe
I'm on my own
I don't know
I don't know
Biblebashing fashion victim
Should have kicked him when he couldn't
Get arrested uncontested
Will to carry on is gone
Inside his head he's dead he said
I never was aliveI died with
Knives and nails and nightingales
This is all the anger I can hold
Kennedy remember me I
Cannot bury you until I
Stare into the mouth of hell
Time alone will tell me how to
Spend the time alone without you
Listen to the songs about you
Run for cover gunners unrevealed
Will aim to please another son
I can't go on
Help me make
That Golden Dawn because
For all we know
We're done and dusted
Must it end like this
Here and now
Here and now
I don't belong here
There's nothing now my eyes can recognize
I'm all wrong here
Let me go I'm not for changing
I don't belong here
I'm not your victim and I don't believe
I'm not strong here
No religion nothing more
I'm telling you know
I'm not your candidate
Guaranteed failsafe
I'm caught in a headrush
And I'm out of control
Whenever I was silenced
Ahen I was on my own
A brutal cold existence
I believed I was gone
Now I stand no longer nameless
Though I've lost more than I'll find
A simple moment set aside
And I feel like I'm mine
There are times when I remember
But in my heart I'm not the same
And I feel myself connected
Every time you speak my name
You speak my name
Without the darkness in my soul
With arms to call my own
I face a future unafraid
And I won't be alone
There's a place where all my dreaming
Will free me from what I became
And I know noone can reach me
Every time you speak my name
You speak my name
There are times when I remember
But in my heart I'm not the same
And I feel myself protected
Every time you speak my name
You speak my name
Don't want to lead a revolution
Let another go ahead
Don't have no need for elocution
No desire to raise the dead
You can't avoid the circulation
Amend the circumstance
Don't want to lose the combination
Still want to hold it in my hands
Can't see around this tunnel vision
From inside of what I've found
When I was wracked with indecision
When my hide was hunted down
Under a moon of innovation
A manysplendoured thing
I need the company I'm keeping
And I feel the hunger
Something happened inside and I can't explain it
I'm in a critical way
When I didn't believe it I couldn't see
Now I live a life in a day
All at once she is gone again when I turn back
Cracking up more than I can take
Make it come right
And I'm dead on my feet hesitating and down
In a dangerous mood where I shouldn't remain
Raining from the harder sky
Don't want them anymore
And taken the meaning away
When I didn't give in I couldn't begin
Now I live a life in a day
Something happened inside and I can't explain it
I'm in a critical way
When I didn't believe it I couldn't see
Now I live a primitive life in a day
Hard on my heels I feel him
from dusk till dawn he stands
Astride the elevation avoiding confrontation
In this infernal chorus
He follows where I lead him under the ground
Who watches he who watchesÃÂ 
Nonone above suspicion
I want an explanation one final word of wisdom
Said you were brighteyed wonder
Set you up right you're finally where you belong
I am your murdering Angel of Death
I will despise you until your last breath
When I cut into you will you not bleedÃÂ 
Decidedly you will provide what I need
Give me a focus now give me a name
Who is responsible who do I blameÃÂ 
Back to your maker return to his side
Unressurected unrecognized
Mockenrue
King of fools you'll never bring him back
He's got them where they want him
Hanging high is this the way it endsÃÂ 
On bended knee not with a bang
But with a fatal kiss I won't twist again
For you can bend me shape me
Won't escape me
Now I've got the reason for the rhyme
Skintight stupid substitute
You don't come close no sense pretending
Dr Suess's golden goose is
Too seductive too demanding
Idle handsome fascist with his
Lovemelovemyvelvetfist attention
never meant to leave me
Now I'm unintentionally fine
Ignited by the realizing eyes
Unwrapped around the solitary sound
A failing voice is railing under walls
Collapsing on the unfamiliar ground
O empty heart am I the only oneÃÂ 
On pins alone or are we many bornÃÂ 
Well either way you are what you've begun
And by the way I never did you wrong
Nothing here is guaranteed nothing's understood
Now that I am far beyond beginning to belong
Can't tell left from right from wrong
God from bad from good
For all you know for all you made of me
It's hard to keep the skin from tender bone
No earthly ties to hang me from on high
I wait beneath your overcrowded skies
Nothing here makes any grade
There's nothing I can do
Fed and watered though I was barely half alive
Time enough to tire me out but now I'm sleeping
I've lost the sense in sanity
Got the bad in good
Beyond imagination born of blood and fire
In splendid isolation I have lived
Corrupted and conspiring
All I wanted all I was living for
An end to all the silent sweet revenge
And nothing more
No longer God's Apollo no more Mercury
Down among the unbelievers
Fuck the wild and wasted look at me
Got pills to sleep got pills to get awake
Eternally I ray noone my breath will take
The honesty is gone now
There is no other way in this state of mine
The resolutions halted
The innocence betrayed by your hand
All I can do is keep uncertain company
I get this murderous intention
With a tendency to fly
How can I hold on
If I'm not living who am I
He knows that I'm about him
He feels me in his skin I follow him in again
Confidence is shaken his conscience is unclear
One of us promised more
I know you lie with me breathtaker
To dream my dreams
You steal them for the maker of rain
Get out of my subterranean heart and I'm alive
Asylum is everything and it's mine
Are you made of stone
And are you there at all or here in my head
Anyone with half a brain would do the same
I know your name
The shadows fill the corners across the square
Without a needlepoint in the light
And the steel to still your tongue
The night hides a multitude of uncovered sins
The heart beating in Capricorn I take on a guise
They won't define me anytime in the English rain
With no movement undiscovered I lie in wait
So what if you're sentimental
And I'm out of tears out of sympathy
I'll make it look accidental
And I'll leave no sign to say your life was mine
Noone I think fell out of my tree
Noone I carried just the same
Thinner than most sinners and saints alive
Dare you speak my name
So what if you're temperamental
And I'm out of tears out of sympathy
So what if I'm elemental
All my life I'm governed and controlled
At someone's beck and call
Made to walk a balanced line
Before I've even crawled
All the time I hungered for release
On independence day
Without a contact or a name
I waited anyway
Torn apart and written in the starts
More I cannot see
Blind enough to follow through
Unsupervised devotion
Forever I was losing sight sound escaping
And all the world was tuning upside down
At least I'm standing on unsolid ground
All my live I'm governed and controlled
At someone's beck and call
Maybe there's no genius
In having lived at all
All my life I'm taken by surprise
I'm someone's waste of time
Now I walk a balanced line
And step into tomorrow
Forever I was losing sight sound escaping
And all the world was tuning upside down
At least I'm standing on unsolid ground
Wakes up forgotten makes up his mind
Sets out to question if he's one of a kind
On and on want to feel somehow
Somewhere in time
You'll see it all the way that I do now
Gives in to impulse reaches in between
Gets back a notion still remembers a dream
Gone again and I don't know how
Some other time
You're going to look like I do now
Finds the faces hidden no names upon a stone
Raises up a fever he rails against the skies
Careless what he wishes for
And what he's always known
On and on want to feel somehow
Somewhere in time
You'll see it all the way that I do now
In and out of daylight hung on for dearest life
Stumbles on misguided is rousing from a sleep
On the street civilians display a common band
Gone again and I don't know how
Some other time
You're going to look like I do now
There must be many more besides
Those to watch us while we're sleeping
So many here so many held
Aligned and catalogues for good
And punching in and punching out
The empty voices keep repeating
I don't live on the outside
I'm provided for in here now
Love us where we stand lead us through this land
We all know the score that's what living's for
Wherever the faithless are
With any other prey approaching
Come hell or come waters high
Believe it or surrender nothing
In all that is envious
He's sworn to continue
And he will contain you all
No one salvation anymore
You're right in the sights
He moves on all sides
Now as I turn
Divided by loyalty surrounded by emotion
Nobody under here remembers any mercy at all
We stay down
Deciding the borderline
Maya did noone tell you
I couldn't have made you mine
'Cause I feel your pain more than my own
All the love gone astray
There will be hell to pay this time
For those of us born to die
There'll be none to testify
Spinning on its side beginning as it ended
Through these diamond eyes
Maid of Morphine settled in my side
Did she intervene
Well I'm the cleanest that I've been
Don't know where I know you from
Time and time again I've lived enough in silence
Mortal memories lost among the unrecalled
Set the cross of fire if I live
These are the only ones if I've loved
Remember who they are
If I look I see them everywhere
Don't know where I know you from
Told me go the way of your heart
I'll be waiting for you
But wherever you are you're not inside me now
Told me try to sleep I will come
But I'm still waiting for you
And wherever you are I'm still inside you now
I'm never going to cut through without you now
If I get ascension or die
All the love that was mine denied
All the love that you qualified
Like a desert I'm open wide
There's nowhere for me to hide at all
For your love I can never go back
Every one of us is herded and contained
Not a single one invited
Voices circulate around the musty hall
And the kerosene's ignited
Incandescent in the crossfire
Do my eyes betray the longest night of all
Do I see or dream of Maya
But he's got us where he wanted us to be
Undivided under control
As the narrow margin finds us face to face
As he laughs across the foxhole
Nowhere was ever safe enough for all of us
No one contender cared about getting out
Tied now behind the hungry fire meant for us
I can't be the same too much has changed
Undeniably real and it's better left unsaid
All the love you said was nothing
Find a rhinestone not a diamond
I never wanted this
Left alive and laid to rest
Told me I was brighter than most
And I believed it all then
Through the dangerous times
I needed more than cold eyes
I want to be alone
To dream myself away from darkness and decay
As I try to forget it
Noone entered into my mind more than Maya
Someone she believed I could be is burning in me
Now I want to be alone like a stronger man
Then I can understand
As I try to remember where I know you from
Provider are you inside or am I
Are you inside provider or am I
Immersed in all the darkness and decay
Denied the sleep to dream myself away
Said I was bright too sensitive to fly
Can't tell you why you don't already know
He reins the horse for those I cannot see
Will I like him a gallant rider be
The skin is pale the sunken eyes are slow
Photographs fingerprints fragile refugee
Higher rise fire in the sky society
Can I hold on can I believe in
All the things you are
There's no sane in chaos reigns in Subterranea
Cadillac heart attack back of this beyond
Pusher king TV queen accommodating blonde
Surgeon carves the matching halves
The blindfold leads the blind
Can I hold on  I cannot count them
All the things you are
And caught within chemical rain
My dreams have turned against me
And fatally have fenced me in
Above me cold light and below me over all
The time I've lost how can I know
So I keep forgetting what I am half recalling
On a bed of fallen flowers
Hold me now as I was held before
Powerhouse sacred vows trigger happy punk
Driven by hidden eyes and figure hugging junk
Heaven knows if I'm close am I unreleased
Can I hold on can I belong to
All the things you are
There's no sane in chaos reigns in Subterranea
Sightless he watches the columns collide
As he wanders the canyons relentlessly wide
Empires are burning the rain cuts his skin
And in every direction the sound closes in
Time only time have I
And already I'm not okay
He falls in with the unwashed and unfed
In these extraordinary lanes
He is blind again unaware still
From the greatest height and to the furthest end
Without association he will bend
And walking with the wounded old and thin
Made to be paraded bring the misfit in
How to overpower the avenues of steel
In my illusion what of this is real
Sleepless incidental what I really need
Is how to now avoid the full stampede
I'm only taking time
And I'm not where I want to be now
Do you seek enlightenment
Are you to frightened to speak
Short of experience
Here where the flesh is so weak
Trust in these hands
Let them attend to you
We understand
We all intend for you
To stand among friends
Are you remembering
Do I revive your neglect
My one
A price must be paid for your sin
And I'm here to collect
All that you are
Is all that you'll ever be
Unless on your hands and knees
You put all your faith in me
Leave me alone
I don't belong here
I'm not your candidate
Guaranteed failsafe
I'm on my own
I don't know
I don't know
Biblebashing fashion victim
Should have kicked him when he couldn't
Get arrested uncontested
Will to carry on is gone
Inside his head he's dead he said
I never was aliveI died with
Knives and nails and nightingales
This is all the anger I can hold
Kennedy remember me I
Cannot bury you until I
Stare into the mouth of hell
Time alone will tell me how to
Spend the time alone without you
Listen to the songs about you
Run for cover gunners unrevealed
Will aim to please another son
I can't go on
Help me make
That Golden Dawn because
For all we know
We're done and dusted
Must it end like this
Here and now
Here and now
I don't belong here
There's nothing now my eyes can recognize
I'm all wrong here
Let me go I'm not for changing
I don't belong here
I'm not your victim and I don't believe
I'm not strong here
No religion nothing more
I'm telling you know
I'm not your candidate
Guaranteed failsafe
I'm caught in a headrush
And I'm out of control
Whenever I was silenced
Ahen I was on my own
A brutal cold existence
I believed I was gone
Now I stand no longer nameless
Though I've lost more than I'll find
A simple moment set aside
And I feel like I'm mine
There are times when I remember
But in my heart I'm not the same
And I feel myself connected
Every time you speak my name
You speak my name
Without the darkness in my soul
With arms to call my own
I face a future unafraid
And I won't be alone
There's a place where all my dreaming
Will free me from what I became
And I know noone can reach me
Every time you speak my name
You speak my name
There are times when I remember
But in my heart I'm not the same
And I feel myself protected
Every time you speak my name
You speak my name
Don't want to lead a revolution
Let another go ahead
Don't have no need for elocution
No desire to raise the dead
You can't avoid the circulation
Amend the circumstance
Don't want to lose the combination
Still want to hold it in my hands
Can't see around this tunnel vision
From inside of what I've found
When I was wracked with indecision
When my hide was hunted down
Under a moon of innovation
A manysplendoured thing
I need the company I'm keeping
And I feel the hunger
Something happened inside and I can't explain it
I'm in a critical way
When I didn't believe it I couldn't see
Now I live a life in a day
All at once she is gone again when I turn back
Cracking up more than I can take
Make it come right
And I'm dead on my feet hesitating and down
In a dangerous mood where I shouldn't remain
Raining from the harder sky
Don't want them anymore
And taken the meaning away
When I didn't give in I couldn't begin
Now I live a life in a day
Something happened inside and I can't explain it
I'm in a critical way
When I didn't believe it I couldn't see
Now I live a primitive life in a day
Hard on my heels I feel him
from dusk till dawn he stands
Astride the elevation avoiding confrontation
In this infernal chorus
He follows where I lead him under the ground
Who watches he who watchesÃÂ 
Nonone above suspicion
I want an explanation one final word of wisdom
Said you were brighteyed wonder
Set you up right you're finally where you belong
I am your murdering Angel of Death
I will despise you until your last breath
When I cut into you will you not bleedÃÂ 
Decidedly you will provide what I need
Give me a focus now give me a name
Who is responsible who do I blameÃÂ 
Back to your maker return to his side
Unressurected unrecognized
Mockenrue
King of fools you'll never bring him back
He's got them where they want him
Hanging high is this the way it endsÃÂ 
On bended knee not with a bang
But with a fatal kiss I won't twist again
For you can bend me shape me
Won't escape me
Now I've got the reason for the rhyme
Skintight stupid substitute
You don't come close no sense pretending
Dr Suess's golden goose is
Too seductive too demanding
Idle handsome fascist with his
Lovemelovemyvelvetfist attention

Then I can understand
As I try to remember where I know you from
They seem to be like you and me
But they've sold their souls to hell
And now they're friends under disguise
They will invoke our doom as the devil's laugh
Friends of hell they deal with Satan at night
When the sacrifice's done
The ancient ones will be summoned
No matter if they're sentenced to burn below
Envenomed are their minds and hearts
Black magic symbols drawn to call the demon lord
Friends of hell 
Drink the blood of the dead
And deal with Satan at night
When the sacrifice's done 
Drink the blood of the dead
The ancient ones will be summoned
They will invoke our doom as the devil's laugh
Friends of hell drink the blood of the dead
And deal with Satan at night
When the sacrifice's done 
Drink the blood of the dead
The ancient ones will be summoned
A rain of fire is falling from the sky
All that you can see around are flames
The city is burning in raging flames
The war machines ride on the wind
Black angels spits death
Women children and men
Made of sun wind and sand
Will take their last breath
Total storm consumes your bones
All is dust blood and ashes
One thousand souls burn in fire
The Satan's army attacks tonight
The world's not only witness of their force
But witness of their lies
It will be written all about this war
Where they were savior angels of good
But someone else will tell the truth
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
The evil forces will kill them all tonight
The winged demons have no mercy of your cries
Now they are waiting for the moment
To rip the sand and suck its black blood
The war machines ride on the wind
Black angels spits death
Women children and men
Made of sun wind and sand
Will take their last breath
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
The evil forces will kill them all tonight
The winged demons have no mercy of your cries
Now I watch their hands rising with my power
Because I give them force
So that they sing with me and make my soul
Burn in the flames of hell
Living a dream of a rocking man
Whwn singing we're burning in the infernal songs
Rising your hands screaming so loud
To give me your power and make me strong
Angels of darkness
Sing with me this song
Let me hear your voices
To feel all your might
Spread your wings
Angels of mine and take me high again
Drink my blood and teach me
There are not boundaries anymore
Now I watch their hands rising with my power
Because I give them force
So that they sing with me and make my soul
Burn in the flames of hell
Angels of darkness
Sing with me this song
Let me hear your voices
To feel all your might
Angels of darkness
Sing with me this song
Let me hear your voices
To feel all your might
I know the night is done
And your game goes on since long ago
I kept promises but you were
Always breaking laws
Mistreating my mind
You teach me it's not worth
Expecting love from you
Expecting lies from you
The time is right 'cause I'am strong
I ain't the loser anymore
Night after night I've lost my dreams
You'd better get away
Out of love I'm out out of love
I've paid the price for being fool
For being blind
Now I'm deaf to your lies
I'm heart of stone out of love
You used to have charm
You've lost your touch
You're out of my heart
Now I'm alone in my way
To live my life as I want
The time is right 'cause I'am strong
I ain't the loser anymore
Night after night I've lost my dreams
You'd better get away
Out of love I'm out out of love
The time is right 'cause I'am strong
I ain't the loser anymore
Night after night I've lost my dreams
You'd better get away
Tired of this chains in my life
On the run is how I want to be
I've shouted to the storm
I've walked against the wind
Freedom is my belief
From this jail I'll be set free
My blood is TNT
The world will know I'm here
Alive hot and mean
The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about I'm about to explode
The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about I'm about to explode
The oppressors of the law are after me
For the power of my youth
But they all are bound to lose
Their time is running out
No chains can hold me down
Like a lion in a cage is how I feel tonight
The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about I'm about to explode
The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about I'm about to explode
The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about I'm about to explode
The time has come to go over the walls
'cause I'm about I'm about to explode
Late at night at the new local bar
We're gonna be there 
Everyone will rock there
The sound there is raw the sound there is loud
So Rock and drink 'till the morning comes
There's fire there there's madness there
See the banging heads tonight
Girls and boys in leather and studs
Gone wild in trance
Leather studs and Rock and Roll
Ask the DJ for Heavy Metal
Feel the power 
Lose control
Feel the blow of the Rock and Roll sound
With our favorite bands we lose control
Got no time for hanging around
Our burning hearts want action tonight
There's fire there there's madness there
See the banging heads tonight
Girls and boys in leather and studs
Gone wild in trance
Leather studs and Rock and Roll
Ask the DJ for Heavy Metal
Feel the power 
Lose control
Those who thought we were down
And out are gonna know we will take control
So bang your heads and fists against the wall
Leather studs and Rock and Roll
Ask the DJ for Heavy Metal
Feel the power 
Lose control
Enclosed in your own wall of fear
You thing you had fallen
The sadness and the shame that you feel
Make bigger the wall
Praying to heaven that is now against you
Pointing out to you
Mercy confess and regret and then maybe
Your demons will be gone
Remember innocent child
The oath that you made
You promised to always be good
The lie was just said
Praying to heaven that is now against 
You pointing out to you
Hunger the knife in your hand needs another one 
Who spread his blood to you
They're offering to wash you're conscience
With a single bunch of prayers
But there's too much death in your hands
And you know that it won't be enough
Praying to heaven that is now against you
Pointing out to you
Mercy confess and regret and then maybe
Your demons will be gone
Taking over through the land
We've got the power
Descending troopers from the sky
We spit fire
Our guns are blazing in the fields
The enemy shall die
They will be gone to burn in hell
And now we've got their land
We spread our wings into the night
So there's no way to fight us back
The target is waiting for our attack
We'll fight like hell for glory's arms
The lords of war they fill our hearts
With hate from hell
In rebel lands now wastelands
Burnt to the ground
The prisioners of war our slaves
They claim for mercy
The other tribes we reign as kings
But the war is endless
We spread our wings into the night
So there's no way to fight us back
The target is waiting for our attack
We'll fight like hell for glory's arms
War is here
Death is comin' in 46 tons of iron
You're hiding in the trench
Waiting for the moment to start to fire
The cold of humid mud added to fear
Paralyzed your mind
You don't wanna die
While you pray your last prayer 
and regret the things you never did
Hear the wheels of the killing machine
The jagopanther was made to kill
And crush the bones and crush your bones
The cold of humid mud added to fear
Paralyzed your mind
You don't wanna die
While you pray your last prayer 
and regret the things you never did
Hear the wheels of the killing machine
The jagopanther was made to kill
And crush the bones and crush your bones
Renounce all sense of guidance
Withstand the loss of peace
Survival must be earned
Whilst pain endured
Witness
A new storms birth
The eye stares right at you
Dazed by the dancing winds
That rip you open
In the depths of your mind
Youll lie lost and blind
True dread you shall know
When qualm strikes your soul
And so it starts
The awareness of doubt
Fear the brother of sleep
Race the labyrinth full of angst
Your descent has just begun
I doubt wallowing in despair
Revolving in circles like halos for demons
I bleed wicked and shadow bound
Corrupted I bathe in these faithless waters
The cracks in the pallid bust of Pallas
Which Ive locked upon my closet
Beckon me for the blessed freedom
That by fear I choose to deny
A craven in sovereign cowardice
Hiding in fear of enlightenment
Confused accusing a world
As blasphemous as me
And I the tasteless jester
The paladin of defeat
The king of all things won and lost
Emperor of selfdeceit
In every altar a fool
In every pulpit a liar
In all of us an evil lies
As we lunge blindly towards the pyre
With a pair of crows
To keep me company
As my heart turns to stone
Shattered in sheer desperation
Desolated I stand
Facing the void of emptiness
In every altar a fool
In every pulpit a liar
In all of us an evil lies
As we lunge blindly towards the pyre
The skies are falling over me
Theyre crushing me and I cant breathe
Under clouds blackened with grief
This damned land will be my grave
Like a dying match my head burns to ash
Like a broken clock my heart beats out of time
I call to you oh spirit come ease my doubts
Have mercy on me save me tear my soul apart
Free me from my mind for I am lost
Please shield me with all your might
The skies are falling over me
Theyre crushing me and I cant breathe
Under clouds blackened with grief
This damned land will be my grave
An animated corpse in a common ditch
Undead from mental wounds and scars unstitched
The weight of the whole cosmos on my chest
I fear even when Im gone Ill still find no rest
Free me from my body it can take no more
On my knees hear me screaming for protection
Your song of wisdom amidst uncertainty
Oh how I need to hear that symphony
Bringer of truth make me your disciple
There are secrets for me to unveil
The skies are falling down
Crushing me and suffocating
Under blackened clouds
This land will be my grave
All hope dies
Crushing Skies
Curse of the world
Riding from the depths
From the abyss we all fear
Harbingers of plague
Our dreadful fate is near
Death of hope season of death
Time to suffer time to rue
Peaceful nights long gone
As greater fears come true
Oh Armageddon
Theres nowhere to run
Our sanctum
Our shrine now destroyed
Aim of the bow
Flash of the blade
Hoofs set ablaze
Tilt of the scale
Swing of the scythe
Void in their wake
March on pale march
March on
Walls painted white
Ground painted red
The prophecy starts to unfold
Skies painted black
Clouds painted green
Behold the dawn of the end
March on pale march
Plague War
Famine Death
The colors of the pale march
Rivers of life never seem still
Flowing through eternity
On through valleys and hills
Underneath and high above
Yet were left with only thirst
Loose traces of how it all came to be
This cruel fate is our curse
In the flow of time
For each moment
Each cherished episode
Each decisive event
All belong to yesterday
Monuments to a past
Blurred and fading away
Twisted out of form
Life is a constant storm
This cruel fate is our curse
In the flow of time
Stars and skies fail to tell the truth
About this world and where it all came from
How did it start when will it end for what
Does this exist what goal is there in life
Theres no answer at all
We dig through time and try to comprehend
Through age we live and learn to fear the end
Through time we learn from what was done before
But have no way to really know for sure
What were truly here for
In the wake of adversity
At the edge of despair
Dark claws ripping skin
Shattered consciousness
This storm is alive
Our minds weakened from the constant doubt
Our weary bodies fall and hit the ground
From ashes born and ashes well become
But really what are all these ashes for
On the verge of a cliff
Just about to fall
In a broken mind
There are no flickers of light
This storm is alive
I depart
I drown
I despair  I exist  I accept  I repeat
Storm Alive
Open the skies
Let it all come down
In the wake of adversity
At the edge of despair
Strong winds wash my skin
Numbness take hold
This storm is alive
Follow me into the fire
Follow me into the fire
Follow me into the fire
Follow me into the fire
Fueling the corporate machine
Everything must stay the same
Collective disbelief
Harvesting horror
While fearing it created it
A nation of frustration
Elected misery
Passively consuming
Headline propaganda
Externalizing pain
Spreaders of hate
Blame upon the blamers
This war is in all of us
Kill
Resurrect
Resuscitate
Declaring the enemy
Throwback history
Our scars of silence
A monument of ignorance
Confessions of fear
The ultimate sacrifice
Carnage or feast
On the edge of sanity
Keep us tight
Keep us small
Make us believe you're 8 ft tall
Sell us high
Buy us low
According to the protocol
Attention is an asset Follow me into the fire
You critique the mainstream Into the fire
You manipulate the mainstream Into the fire
And while you're busy keeping your integrity
Society is catching up
And you become the mainstream
You become the mainstream
You become the mainstream
You
Authority through iconography
Authority through ipornography
The pig must fear
What the pig must fear
The blood on your hands
Is none of your business
You're not the soldier
You're the gun
Follow me kill
Follow me kill
Follow me kill
Follow me kill
I'm feeling so empty inside
I couldn't find any reason to stay
My life is too precious to sacrifice
The darkest of shadows follow my soul
Tonight I will join all lost ones on the run
I have to run away
I'm all alone in this world
I wait for the nightfall eager to leave
I whisper goodbye to the house of fear
Watching my sister cry in her sleep
One day she will understand
I know I'm scarred for life
all messed up with no place to go
I'm out here all alone
Lonelier than the streets I wander
I'll always have these scars inside
I'm scarred for life
I'm lost in the cold of the night
Looking for shelter until the dawn turns to day
I'm holding my hands to my head
For the silence to reappear
The fragments and places remembered with fear
Never to leave just fade away
I'll carry them with me forever and a day
Just like a nail in my heart
So lonely  feeling so alone in the dark
The world is really fierce out here
I'm so alone and scared
I'm tired and the cold is getting to my bones
Everything is so unreal fighting on my own
My heart is pounding fast
So lonely  thinking of the end I'm soon to see
I don't know where to run
Oh I don't know where to go from here
I don't know right from wrong
I just have to carry on
Awakened by a stranger looking down at me
Another soul on the run
Telling me his heart is glad to find me
Together we will try to make it out alive
We don't know where to run
Oh we don't know where to go from here
We don't know right from wrong
We just have to carry on
We don't know where to run
Oh we don't know where to go from here
I've found a friend
Someone that is sharing my pain
We are throwing all our fears into the fire
Life for us has only just begun
The two of us so young and so wild
We can't find the cure to what has led us astray
Far apart from what we once were
There's no turning back from here
But we have no aim just keeping up the pace
Who's the best of us who's the stronger one
Will it ever end
This escalating game
We're reborn to live on the edge
Who's the bravest of us
Who will live to tell
I'm so scared of what we've become
The proportions exceed our sanity
We have gone from meek to brave
Letting go of all our fears
The unavoidable end is the enemy we defy
But we have no aim just keeping up the pace
Who's the best of us who's the stronger one
Will it ever end
This escalating game
There can be only one
The rain is cold as ice today
The day I never wanted to come
We have come to the final round
We have reached the point of no return
You are the one to show the way
This is the final dare
I know this could be your last day
I place the rope around your neck
I can see the anguish in your eyes
No My breath is swept away by the sight I see
I cannot move I cannot scream Oh No
He chokes for breath in vain
I fail to cut the rope in time
The game is over now
His broken soul is lost for evermore
I feel his soul far away
A part of me has died
I wonder who's to show the way
He left this world behind
I feel his soul far away
A part of me has died
I wonder who's to show the way
My heart is in pain
Surrounded by emptiness
How could I do this to my only friend
The memories of joy vanished without a trace
Wandering aimlessly
Empty inside
I know I'll never be be myself again
Death and despair is forever to dwell in my soul
It's never to leave me no
I feel so alone
Guilt is written all over me
I'm losing myself in this maze of remorse
I only see darkness wherever I turn
I know he'll never be be alive again
I can't stand the pain any longer
Lonely
Losing time and space
I am reborn in remorse and regret
Oh no sight of light inside
The darkness is all around
I'm calling your name
I wish you could see me now
But only my echo is with me tonight
You know I would trade my life for your return
But you'll never hear this promise I make
I know I'll never be be myself again
I can't stand the pain any longer
Lonely
Losing time and space
My soul is reborn in remorse and regret
Oh no sight of light inside
The darkness is all around
My world is insane
I surrender to silence
But will I be able to bury the truth
I'm all alone
Waiting for no one
I see the daylight fade away
I'm so afraid
I know you're around me
I hear you crying in the wind
If I could bring you back
If I had the power I'd give you my world
And my life you'd have it all
But life is not a game
And I know the rules and I know I must follow
them every single day
I feel that I'm loosing it all
There's nothing left to live for
I'm ending it all in my dreams
It always seems so easy in my sleep
I'm all alone
Waiting for darkness
I wish the sun would slip away
I still believe that you didn't leave me
I see your shadow in the haze
If I could have some peace
Ending the nightmare closing the chapter
And join you in your sleep
But life is not a game
And I know the rules and I know I must follow
them every single day
I feel that I'm loosing it all
There's nothing left to live for
I'm ending it all in my dreams
And deep inside I knew
That there was one part of me
That tried to save you from yourself
The other let you go and I will
Never deny I was walking on the line of
Here and nevermore in selfish pride
Day and night just come and go
I hate that life is so deceiving
I feel this urge to turn away
From all the sadness and grieving
I find my way back to the place where we parted
All I hear is my heart pounding inside
I'm so afraid of what I'll see when I return
There's a part of me that needs to say goodbye
Until we meet again
Now and then he reappears
In my dreams
In my illusions
Pointing out the chosen path
It feels so real
Am I really dreaming
Soon I'll see what time has done to my creation
Hell on Earth is just a few steps away
The Sun is hiding
I am in the heart of darkness
I'm closing in on the godforsaken tree
The moment I defy the pain
Is here again in another way
All the fear in my life
Is erased from my soul
I never knew that my fantasies
Could be oh so close to reality
And what I see here right now
Is so hard to believe
I see the rope my friend is gone
His body's nowhere to be found
I hear him whisper in the wind
I hear him calling out my name
Am I going insane
The moment I defy the fear
Is here again I can feel he's near
All the fear in my life
Have returned to my soul
I never knew that my fantasies
Could be oh so close to reality
And what I'm hearing right now
Is so hard to believe
Darkness all around me I believe
That we will be together once again
The time has come to leave this dreadful place
I think I've found a way out of this maze
Tonight the moon will shine upon my grave
God has failed Here's one he cannot save
My life is over I just can't go on
Nowhere to run I'm turning black inside
I hope to meet him in the other sky
I've realized I'm only born to die
I close my eyes and ask myself again
Is there really nothing left to do
The silence in my heart just prove me right
Soon my journey will begin towards eternal night
I'm breathing water death is closing in
It's cold and dark but I am not afraid
I'm out of breath There's no way out of here
This is the end of all the pain and fear
I lie here by the lakeside
I am still alive somehow
It's all too strange for me to understand
How could someone see me
In the darkness of the night
How could someone bring me back to life
Is there another world
Dead or alive
Oh life is haunting me
I can't describe the feeling
Could it all just be a dream
I'm still wet and the memories remain
I'v realized that life has to go on
It's so hard to decide
Dead or alive
Now fear will carry me back to the world
Another day is dawning
Now my journey will begin
Destined to return to normal life
It feels like I've been out here
For eternity and more
I've lost all sense of time
But I'll be strong
It's so hard to decide
Dead or alive
Oh my past is haunting me
My heart never wanted to leave
The silence was gold for my soul
But I am heading back home I return
To the world that I decide to leave
My life is a waste of time
I wish I could end it
But something won't let me go
I'm back everything looks the same
All these people but I still alone
Torn torn apart
The scars are still bleeding inside
I'll never forgive you
One part of me always cry
And it's crying 'cause of you
So long ago
I gave you my heart it was
So long ago
I gave you my soul it was
So long ago
But you gave me hell in return
You made what I am here today
All the sadness you brought to my soul
Is something I'll never find ways to defy
If you could see me what you've done to me now
Maybe you would understand 
The love you never gave me
Would have made me much stronger inside
But it is too late to change
So long ago
I gave you my heart
So long ago
And I gave you my soul
So long ago
And I gave you I gave you my heart
So long ago
But you gave me hell in return
I'm back where the darkness began
All is empty not a soul around
Where are you now
Where did all of you go
Nothing is left
Nothing is left from before
It seems like a lifetime has passed here
While I was gone
Millions of miles a way
To blow you away
A world in flames
Burned and destroyed beyond all recognition
That only dust remains
And created their souls
War of the Worlds
War
War of the Worlds
War
War of the Worlds
Focused on eternity
Ancient gazeinto the morning sun
Tell me nowWhat do you see
HidingCelestial mysteries
I See
Astronomica
Years of light away
Second sister to the eternal sun
I can't believe my eyes
That the prophecies have come
Stretched beyond the limits
Out into the unknown
No words that I can give it
Except my mind is blown
World's spinning round in space
Lonely star without a face
Left by ourselves we trace
Our footsteps back
To Astronomica
A twinkle in the eye of a past life's memory
Something that I used to think
Someone I used to be
I see
I can't believe my eyes
That the prophecies have come
Looking down upon your world
Desperate changes it goes through
My blackeyed point of view
Though you think you know my face
Occupying space is what
Brings me here to you
Mask the fear of evil you can't conceive
Transversed through time and space
There is no God to save your race
We harvest the worlds we need
You hide in fear from terror you can't conceive
Bending time and space
We are the Gods of your race
We harvest the worlds that we need
If we could only Touch The Sun
To dream is not enough
The world is on our hands
The full moon is burning
In the crimson sky
A wicked witches laughter
Echoes in the night
The wolves of doom howl
A warning to the wind
Red eyes of fire
Haunting your dreams again
Watch out for her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say goodbye
Watch out for her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
Say goodbye
Dragon lady wants to meet you
Step into her lair
Death waits in the shadows
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
Enter the fire and challenge the witch
If you dare
No no no no
Watch out for her poison heart
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crystal ball
It tells all
Watch out now she's breathing fire
She's a dragon lady
Look into her crimson eyes
You shall die
She's a dragon lady
Watch out
Dragon lady wants to meet you
Down through the valley of shadows we go
Into the canyon of moonlight below
Stairs of stone descending
Down where the magic river's bending
Down the river we go
To the sea of gold
Where things are not as they seem
Why you are not as you were
Behold eternal world
Where time has no meaning
Reality is dreaming
Feel your flesh is melting
Feel you spirit twisting
Feel it ripping at your mind
There's no time for praying
Feel your soul is pleading
The curse is not a lie this knowledge is truth
When darkness falls forever we all will know
There will be no sanity no healing no eternity
Dragons fly to the burning sky
When darkness falls the end will call
Mankind weeps and laments on its descent to hell
When the last crack tears us to pieces
Cowards try to cast a sheltering spell
But the deafened races words remain unspoken
When darkness falls forever we all will know
There will be no sanity no healing no eternity
Dragons fly to the burning sky
When darkness falls the end will call
Seven days to hide the last it didnt fade
When darkness falls forever we all will know
There will be no sanity no healing no eternity
Dragons fly to the burning sky
When darkness falls the end will call
When darkness falls the end will call
When darkness falls
Where I am my feet dont move they dont run
But I aint yearning to be gone
Whenever this day will dawn I will have
Left the ground
Touch the skies just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind let the sun go blind
I will see the next one from a higher ground
However it will make things turn I will have
Left the ground
Touch the skies just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind let the sun go blind
Where I go my thoughts will shine again
But I aint yearning to be gone
Whenever this day will dawn I will have
Left the ground
Touch the skies just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind let the sun go blind
I will see the next one from a higher ground
However it will make things turn I will have
Left the ground
Touch the skies just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind let the sun go blind
Where I am my feet dont move
Where I go my thoughts will shine again
I will see the next one from a higher ground
However it will make things turn I will have
Left the ground
Touch the skies just like butterflies
Leave the thoughts behind let the sun go blind
I will see the next one from a higher ground
So you are not alone
There is some hope there is some faith
You are running lonely through this world
So you are not alone
There is some hope there is some faith
A scream a voice some hope some faith
A scream a voice some hope some faith
So you are not alone
There is some hope there is some faith
A scream a voice a hope some faith
So you are not alone
You are not alone
He wants your soul he will blind you
Tell you lies betray you deceive you
He calls himself so many names
But his real one you will never never know
Pray for me now pray for me
Cry before you die before you die
Pray for me so pray for me
Die for your sins
The path is long and far
But he will never lead us to the promised land
Dont follow dont follow this false prophet
Pray for me now pray for me
Cry before you die before you die
Pray for me so pray for me
Die for your sins
Take revenge on the whole human race
Take revenge on the whole human race
He will take his revenge on humanity
He wants your fortune your belongings
He will suck every single drop of your blood
Pray for me now pray for me
Cry before you die before you die
Pray for me so pray for me
Die for your sins for your sins
Pray for me now pray for me
Cry before you die before you die
Pray for me so pray for me
Die for your sins
Cry for me
Sinking through layers of unknown prayers
Inside of me I need to know
Is more than Ive ever seen
The real world more than Ive ever seen
The sighs in me I rise with the winds of sleep
Aint nothing without light  sleeping solution
Aint nothing without light  sleeping solution
Aint nothing without light  sleeping solution
Aint nothing without light  sleeping solution
Sleeping solution
If words have meanings then why are we bemused
Silence aint made to clear the shades
Silence aint made just like the blade of a maze
Just words
Words mean much more than you expect them to
Silence aint made to clear the shades
Silence aint made just like the blade of a maze
Just words
Speak to me and if you want to then you scream
Dont wait just speak and I will be released
Silence aint made to clear the shades
Silence aint made just like the blade if a maze
All the grudge and all the fears
By the unspoken wordssilence aint made
That you suffer unto having on your mind
Walk this way and you will find
Those burning bridges inside your mind
So you look back into nowhere
To see all these bridges are meant to stay
Knocked down and out you cry it out loud
Locked inside your selfmade prison
Walk this way and you will find
Those burning bridges inside your mind
So you look back into nowhere
To see all these bridges are meant to stay
That you suffer unto having on your mind
Walk this way and you will find
Those burning bridges inside your mind
So you look back into nowhere
They are getting small these shadows on the wall
Shadows that dwell for your own private hell
Have you faced the flames inside
Have you ever understood mankind
Both ends burning inside the circles turning
Staring into the glass making a mess
Have you faced the flames inside
Have you ever understood mankind
Bleed it out reach for the sane
Have you faced the flames inside
Have you ever understood mankind
Have you faced the flames inside
Have you ever understood mankind
I remember the beauty I remember the youth
I remember illusions I remember the truth
I remember the reason suffering unto the change
I remember the beast I remember the wild
I remember visions and hating the lie
I remember the reason suffering unto the change
spring follows winter the blooming will start
spring follows winter the blooming will start
I remember the beast I remember the wild
I remember visions and hating the lie
I remember the reason suffering unto the change
A last trace of faith and the last grain of pain
Howls in past desires a last prayer at parting
Say goodbye expectations six feet under
Say goodbye slain by the god of thunder
Say goodbye wont ask you to tell heaven or hell
Though someone says the dies been cast
But I see us fading in the shadows of a new life
Say goodbye expectations six feet under
Say goodbye slain by the god of thunder
Say goodbye wont ask you to tell heaven or hell
My grief my greed transcend with the leaves
No more tears to shed once simply red
Leave me alone dreams wont come undone
Say goodbye expectations six feet under
Say goodbye slain by the god of thunder
Say goodbye wont ask you to tell heaven or hell
You're chased
The time that you've just lost made your caught
Run if you want to keep putrid existence
The hunt has started
No way to escape
The hunt has begun
No way to escape
You caused it
Now it's happening to you
Run fast if you want survive
No one escape to the past
You're the first concerned
You killed raped tortured
You enjoyed it for too long
You deceided and end to that
It's too late because it's not like
It's not going to happen
Now the beast is awaken
Fury took the control about
You've done them
Now it's your turn
Run run as a meaningless prey
Hurry up to hide
We won't have mercy
We won't let to go
You will become your former victims
Skinned attached by your own tired muscles
But it would be too easy to leave you like this
'Cause you don't deserve it
'Cause you don't deserve it
But it would be too easy to leave you like this
'Cause you don't deserve it
'Cause you don't deserve it worth
We'll let free 
Keep you safe
But scared forever
The hunting game will soon start
They're sure God is on their side
and His laws demand our death
Their jacket stuffed with dynamite
Many people will die tonight
They say their prayers then ignite
Another crowd is blown to bits
They spill the blood of the ignorant
Disappear in bloody stains
Indoctrinated to kill and fight
and die in Allahs name
For God and Country
Now they bring terror in our streets
But they can never kill us all
Maybe we will tumble but we will never fall
A holy war at our homes is just a matter of time
They're sure God is on their side
and that His law demands our death
Their jacket stuffed with dynamite
Many people will die tonight
They say their prayers then ignite
Another crowd is blown to bits
They'll never stop to sacrifice
'coz it only makes them proud
To end their lives in martyrdom
To die for a sacred cause
For God and Country
Dispatch the warmachines
Quintessential submarines
Missiles ready at command
The rain of doom is now at hand
Now they will feel the wrath
The sword of Damocles will fall
Now they will feel the wrath
For all
Now they will feel the wrath
The sword of Damocles will fall
Now they will feel the wrath
For all
Our tubes of mass destruction
Launched from many miles offshore
A strategy of cowardness No heroism left in war
Now what's their fucking problem
They'll get what they deserve
Let's deal with all these parasites right away
Right here right now so get out of my way
I want to push the button
Today I'm whacking flies
From the rubble and the chaos
To the occasion I will rise
World Power or Downfall
Give me world power or no power for all
United we stand divided we fall
No longer can I stick my head into the sand
If you are not with me then you must be against
They all been warned not to fuck with us
But yet they screwed us once too much
I want to push the button
Today I'm whacking flies
From the rubble and the chaos
A new order will arise
World Power or Downfall
'FUCK YOU' is all that I think of
We lost the grip on our lives
We voted for you you sent us into
a war we didn't want to fight
Save me your populist promises
Sold our sons to the mighty USA
and made of my glorious fatherland
a puppet nation in decay
While at home many houses burn
Hard lessons our boys will learn
You cannot beat invisible enemies
And so as dusty corpses they return
Fuck your conspiracy
Fuck your democracy
and your glorious nation too
Proud of the medals you gathered
In the course of world war three
Still honoured by ignorant masses
But you don't mean shit to me
Too many morons have bought your shit
And yet so few have tried to resist
Now intelligence and facts revealed
The axis of evil does not exist
A modern society brought down to its knees
Is you I know it's true
In times of misery our history is made
In our hours of darkness we were all betrayed
By you  And you know it too
Fucker
Away with your hollow rhetoric
Too long we have been too naive
We relied on you you sent us into
A dream we no longer believe
Ensuing years of incompetence
Backed by a firm belief in God
When we finally gain our 'victory'
Face of lies
Cry of the universe is faith
The Beauty that's digging your warm grave
I see the Heaven candles giving light
But every heavy drop comes crushing me
Burning deep
Turn back the time I've chosen misery
Didn't see the hollow mask of purity
Its hands are washed in blood
And terror faced by dying souls
The Christianity
Was cradle of most frightful worms
I'm cursed to become
One with the dust
Cause my last hope
Is dying
When you're afraid to live
When you can't believe
You hide
Power of mind
So come alive
Shatter the night
Reveal the lies they told
And claim the unseen face of the truth
For all
The ancient gods are only wooden masks
I see the worms that dig the way inside
To the core
Follow me down to the end of the road
Take one more step and open the door
There's no turning back my reflection's REVERSED
There are too many questions
And not too many answers
If you'll try to find the essence
You'll find everywhere silence
I am asking who we are
Why we're living why the day is after night
Who created us who's the father
Of the Earth of sky and red fire
Those searches to insaine
Simbol of human nature
Those searches are in vain
Are simbols of our lifes
Who conquers the time
It's all a lie
It's a special lie
It's A WASTE OF TIME
My eyes will see the lies
Running for eternity
I am listening to the voices from the past
Who are praying for relief
From this endless pain of hoping and crying
Those searches to insaine
Simbol of human nature
Those searches are in vain
Are simbols of our lifes
Hopes remorses
Like yours and mine
I found this meanings
Living my life
I doubted the good man when I was down
And I felt so afraid that I could never win
Crying and waiting
I asked for the star to obey to my will
And I tryied to escape from the moments of hate
Running and hiding
Love and hate trust and betrail
Fire and water corage and fear
Demons and angels the sun and the moon
This is my life  or maybe is not
Hope was my lonely friend I trusted
In you again with my blinded eyes
Hate you will strike again haunting
In my mind beating up my will
All the hate in me is bitting now my heart
And my restlless soul
And I'll return defeat to hide
Shadows land where I lived before
The time is to hate
To seek memorize
To kill what you feel
Hopes remorses
Like yours and mine
I found this meanings
Living my life
The wind of pain is blowing
The seeds of death are growing
Near my soul
The leaves of joy are falling
Around my head they're going
Down with me
Inside the storm I'm fighting
The teeth of fear are biting
Hard from me
Black thunder sun is lighting
It's sword of war is thrusting
Deep inside
The soul of mine is bleeding
The fear of faith is creeping In my life
The crowds of thorns are shreding
My forehead that is spreading In the dust
Inside the storm I'm standing
The waves of flood are drowning
Me in slumber
My world of dreams is crushing
Under the weight of smashing
Tears of sorrow
The sins of your soul are devils within you
The leaves of your heart are falling down
There is no escape no way to defend yourself
The battle is here inside you
YOU FIGHT
I see my soul behind the mirror glass
My mind is gone so far away
Dreaming at those souls behind the clouds
Asking if I'll reach this stairway
There was a time when I was looking
For the meanings of my life
To run and hide
Trying to get with every single moment
Pleasures and to set
My wishes all above I never thought
Someone gets hurt
Ignoring the time you'll win this fight
Escape from this chaos return into light
You shall find
Peace inside
And if I'll try to change this sorrow
But how
And if I'll try to see the sky
But why
Now time has come and I am looking
At the shadows of my life
With all disgrace and anger I close my eyes
From all those times
I realise that things are not
The way they seems all the time
The mirror is crushed I turn my face to the sky
To see the light
Lord show my way how to escape from this
On holly ground and to be
I see your hands behind
The chains of your life
I feel your burning tears
Your endless cry
Your darkened fears
I touch your eyes behind
The clouds of your night
I feel your frozen breath
Your desperate need
To stay alive
Your dreams are blood for me
Your hopes help me feed
You burn alive
You cannot die you've cursed to bleed
Your mind is drowning
In a sea of despair
You cry you die
You vanish slowly in the air
Your words I can never trust
Are your ghosts from within the past
They'll be haunting you
They'll be watching you
Your fear you want to hide
You belive I can never find
Is thy destiny
Of your heathen soul
Oh my lonely friend
What they've done to you
What you're gonna do
Are you going to be
The forgiven one
For eternity
Will thy be a day
For a better way
For the things you pray
Will you have the chance
To reveal
The faith to burn the demons
Sword and shield bone and steel rictus grin
Deaf forever to the battles din
You're playing tricks babe and that's a fact
Your magic circle ain't where's its at
Nothing up my sleeve babe
Watch out watch out
Magic's what you need babe
Just like that
Maybe this time babe you're gonna get it right
One moment I was there now just an empty chair
Saw me in half babe and that's quite a trick
You make me laugh babe you make me sick
I don't believe a word I know you tell me lies
You just can't figure out why I'm the way I am
I've had enough I'm stepping out of line
Ain't gonna stop me babe you ain't worth a dime
You nearly had me fooled wastin' my time
You might've broke my heart
And if you broke my heart
I know it ain't my crime
I'm here to tell you was here and now I'm gone
You need a wages slave but I sure ain't the one
I'm moving off the lot just hire another act
Just show me the door here I go again
I seen it all before happens now and then
No tears in your eyes sure ain't none in mine
Two people in disguise frozen in time
Watching you watching me
I was hoping you'd be here tonight
Watching him watching you
He'd better watch out too
'Coz he keeps getting in my light
I think he's going overload
Don't know what you're running for
He thinks he's got you where he wants you babe
But he don't understand the power of the claw
The claw the claw the claw
You know me I know you
We both know what we came here fore
And he think he knows you
He thinks he's got you too
Gonna make him cry for sure
He's going to have to make his own way home
I don't know what's he's smiling for
He thinks you're gonna keep your promises babe
But he don't understand the power of the claw
The claw the claw the claw
Me walking up to you
And whisper in your eager ear
You whisper back to me
And he begins to see
He feel the claw is near
And so the ballet starts again
Exit stage left through the door
And we begin the horizontal dance
And he begins to know just what the claw is for
The claw the claw the claw the claw
The claw the claw the claw the claw
You know just what the claw is for
You know just what the claw is for
You know just what the claw is for
I know what my claw is for
Midnight runaway know you're running scared
Bright lights big city nobody seems to care
Open your eyes who's there who's there
Open your eyes nightmare
Better call the FBI better change your name
Open your eyes oh no oh no
Open your eyes creepshow
Unclean fever dream take a ride Mean Machine
Wet dream bad scene we don't care where you been
On the screen movie queen things ain't always
What they seem stay clean crazy dream
Off the high side in the Mean Machine
You know the rules you all know the game
Try and do whats right
And I swear I can't complain
If I die tonight
But I don't think its in the stars
For me to go that way
I'll be here for a long long time babe
I'm here to stay
I was born to rock'n'roll everything I need
I was born with the hammer down
I was built for speed
Bet your life it ain't no easy money
But you won't hear me bitch
Spent a long time wrecked and funny
I've got the ten year itch
See me running all around the world
Trying to make some time
A million miles a million girls
A million real good times
Don't you listen to a single word
Against rock'n'roll
The new religion the electric church
The only way to go
I don't give a good goddam
My lifes been alright
I'm gonna crazy out of my mind
Every single night
No force on earth can stop me now
Like to see 'em try
Hey hey ridin' with the Driver
Engineer like to lose his mind glory in his eye
Too fast to live this way too young to die
My my ridin' with the Driver
All right all right
I hope you son of bitches see the light
You again you again
I know you've got a mental age of ten
Listen up listen up
I wouldn't swap you for a thousand bucks
Come on you're the one
I think I'm going to switch your lazer on
I've got the medicine you need
I've got the power I've got the speed
I'll find out how to stop your clock
We sure ain't talking Doctor Spock
Hear me talking Doctor Rock
Lay down turn around
Here come the sister gonna strip you down
Shut up breathe in
Lets have the address of your next of kin
Chin up shoulders back
You've got a body like a Marshall stack
Keep still take your pill
Or I'm gonna make you really ill
Next please next please
Try to separate those cowardly knees
Xray you've gotta pay
The only chance you've ever got of getting away
Here we are what's the scar
I don't like anything I've seen so far
Pay me pay me
I ain't no doctor of philosophy
My image is of agony my servants rape the land
Obsequious and arrogant clandestine and vain
Hypocrisy made paramount paranoia the law
My name is called religion sadistic sacred whore
I am the emperor of lies you grovel at my feet
And all my promises are lies all my love is hate
I am the politician and I decide your fate
You know the rules you all know the game
Try and do whats right
But you know I can't complain
If I die tonight
'Cos you know it wouldn't be so easy
'Cos life ain't that way
And you know I've got unfinished business
Got a word to say
On The Road
Bet your life it ain't no easy livin'
But you won't hear me bitch
Spent as much time taking as giving
I've got the ten year itch
But I wouldn't change the situation
If I could start again
'Cos you know I've got a bad reputation
But I don't feel no shame
On The Road
Don't you listen to a single word
Against rock'n'roll
The new religion the electric church
The only way to go
There's only one thing that I need
To make my life alright
I just want the one I want
I want her every night
On The Road
He moves so slowly but he's coming after you
Nowhere to hide and not a thing that you can do
You're on his mind you're on his mind
You're gonna leave the human race
You know you can't stand the pace
Gonna sink without a trace
He's gonna steal your face
Just sit and shiver and be ready for the bite
You're on his mind you're on his mind
Nowhere to run you know he's never far away
Knows where you are and he gets closer every day
You're on his mind you're on his mind
And I'll bet that he can't wait
You know he's gonna take the bait
Gonna be on your case
He's gonna steal your face
He's gonna steal your face
He's gonna steal your face
He's gonna steal your face
Don't drink the bitter wine
You are not among the chosen
But soon you will receive what's coming
Christ comes through the window
Christ comes through the roof
Christ comes to kill sin
Christ comes in truth
Heavenly Father angry with his children
Sends his firstborn to kill them
High and low they will all fall
By the swords of Heavens Horde
Holy ground covered by dead religious
On the doors of the Sanctimonious
No mark of lamb's blood painted
Earth is cleansed no longer tainted
Christ stands triumphant hateful master
The lion's will is done disaster
Man cannot suffer enough for his sins
Man cannot suffer enough for the nails
Sensations are lost
Flatline of the mind
Radiant eye of the world storm
Calm as the glow of silver
Reign from heaven
Ripples not the stillness
Of the depths
Unto which I have fallen
Days like pearls lined
In a necklace of pain
Pearly gates to pain
Open wide
Punishment and ordeal
You sent me here
King coldness
Of no solace
While my brother's keeper
Won't let go
See me I am here
Bleeding for you
My inner room
Vibrant with your sorrow
I see your light
As through tears
I lay a shadow
In your shadow
You sleep righteous
Above the throng
The orphan's choir unheard
Billions wailing so alone
I refuse these ashes
My mind's eye see my mind's I
While the evidence of weakness
Is piling up in heaps
The filth of sweat and tears
Streaming from me
The greed and lust and all these fears
The lies and alcohol that drips
From my mouth from my mouth
A mount Zion inside with a ceiling
Undying thirst for us dying children
I fail to ascend as I ponder infinity
Oh endlessly
I refuse these ashes
My mind's eye see my mind is I
While the evidence of weakness
Is piling up in heaps
The filth of sweat and tears
Streaming from me
The greed and lust and all these fears
The lies and alcohol that drips
From my mouth from my mouth
Angels sang these words to me
Granting hope with a prophecy
The lord of mercy will return
To pour out his love to burn
Great white mass in gospels sing
Joyous hymns for the King
The funereal psalm that is creation
Soon void of mans distortion
All things good though mostly bad
All the dreams we ever had
All the hate and little love we shared
Will be nothing will be nothing
There will be silence silence
Silence over the depths again
The dove will leave no ones hands
Just to find all empty lands
We call out to you from this mire
Of no love and wrong desires
Our path to self realization
Lead to the soul's annihilation
With hearts like holes
We wander in confusion
Our famished souls
Wallow in delusions
A roar and we all fall
No chain restrains the beast
We have entered an abyss
The old speech of tongues now
Heretic's gospels best unsung
All values broken down
Into bitter frowns
Your spine stoops
Then a crack
A whip wielded by ones greed
It can't be held back
In the mire in the mire
Beckoning fortune
Your pot of gold
No sense no direction
You lost your soul
To the mire
You lost it all
To the mire
Jesus dies inside my heart
Judas lingers on
All my values broken down
In a bitter frown
A chain of deeds committed
Weigh heavy round my chest
It can not be broken
Only outstretched
Jesus dies inside my heart
While Judas lingers on
My heart has broken down
Pumping end time rhymes
I leave these words to discourage
See I block my own path with stones
Drunk with wormwood I stumble
In lies entangled and aloneHay un abismo
The plenilune feast
Follow the way of the secret life
Silently graze archaic dimensions
On water and over wind
The god of woods call his sons
Enraptured by his power
Follow the divine melody
The magic key
Till the flight's end
Vivid flares flashing in darkness are reflected
In the owl's fixed eyes
Walk along the hidden paths
It reveals the glade
And the walnut you knew through the deer's eyes
Maleventum
A long black robe appears among the trees
His gaze lighted upon the moon
His barbarian hymn hails to the moon
Nine words of nine letters thunder in silence
And the night's star reveals its secret nature
his shout opens the black diamond doors
the circle holds on tight to him
the old chant sing out
Palas Aron Ozimonas
Baske Bano Tudan Donas
Geheamel Cla Orlay
Berec he pantaras tay
I'm the encounter dance I'm the chain dance
I'm the blending of darkness and light
I give my blood to mother earth
Burn fire burn bright Burn fire burn bright
Firebright Firebright
Come to me pure vision
Come to me pure vision
Oh master of winds and magic dances take my
most solemn prayer with you in the star's circle
Celestial arc earth Life's and death's donor
Perhephone astarte astoreth inanna
I'm the end of the shady path
Sink Into the eternal and primordial sleep
Sink Into the inner earth's secret heart
Forget and keep silent Drink persephone's water
At the secret source beside the sacred tree
Now I'm the secret queen
Of air and earth of fire and water
Of human souls and destiny's dream
The chant is dying out In a vibrating echo
Dusk melting Into the silvery night of plenilune
Hoor Apep The depth's dragon will rise now
Hoor Apep The depth's dragon will rise now
Now
Consecrate the altar with your symbols
This is the night when the breeze will
rekindles the sacred fire and when the
Sacred stones will sing your new name
It's the night of the breeze rekindling
the sacred fire it's the night of the
sacred stones singing your new name
Draw the circle with the athame and
undress your candid body
To let the eye of the Gods see your essence
Guardians of the north sacred spirits of
the earth In the dark of your warm womb
accept my death I offer you my greetings
and I welcome you
Guardians of the east sacred spirits of
the Air As the sun rises from the east
after the night Guide my soul to a new
birth Lead my soul to a new dawn
Guardians of the South sacred spirits of
the Fire Protect me and lighten my
journey on the new path Watch over me
and make my journey on the new path bright
and clear I offer you my greetings and
I welcome you Guardians of the west
sacred spirit of the water Purify me and
make me clear as new spring I offer you
born again We all come from the same
womb This is the song of the goddess
the key to the great union
Anoint your breast and your womb
Widen the door of the new fate
And introduce yourself with your new
name Ensemble of flesh enlived by new
power Take the cup and the athame
raising your arms to the sempitern eye
As the cup is female so the knife is
male Now joined They bring blessing
Consecrate your sacrifice and
enjoy the gifts of the great mother
Close your circle and step over
in the truth that all the  circles hold
Go now you new creature
Now the master of the Only art
That all the arts contains
And where all the arts come from
Live with honour
And with honour die
You the master of the
Only arcane craft
That all the arts gathers
Surface and sends out the shivers
From those waves I will read the future fate
Oh silphs inhabitants of the Air
By Paralda dominated
So that I may decipher to roar of the wind
Sator Arepo Tenet Opera Rotas
The ethereal foundation void of every substance
Ouroboros you are the void that everything is
You are the primordial substance that is Chaos
Vibrates and floods it with light
The real secret is still unspeakable
vision
The snake son of Apsu generates the Chaos
Its motto is one for everything
Circle within circle
Towards the warm heart of the earth
Circle within circle
Falling Falling inside my wideness
I opened wide the doors of the underworld
Fragment making up
a part of the eternity
In the eternal forest shelter I found
Guest of its big trees
Fed on its abundance
Through unknown land I travelled
In the fatherland over there
Where the giants dwell
I followed gods' footsteps
Towards an high mountain
Set in its stone a great throne I saw
And on it a small and wrinkled man
Looking at me frowning
under its big red hat I am the great deer
Who runs between dimensions
I am the mother
Who gave birth to all religions
I am the stairway linking the opposites
I am the door leading to the sidh
Great is my spirit Matchless my power
Fear of me mortal men
If afraid of me you are
Then your trembling soul I will eat up
Great will be your medicine
If my words you are able to listen
Great will be your strength
If from the deer's flesh you feed
Great will be your wisdom
If you know how to ride on me
So then at the house of the gods
I will lead you Going up the great
river Going up the great river
Towards the starry sky
And of a different destiny
I will clad you You will meet all
the spirits and with them you will
compete your strength To be a real men
your humanity you must shed
And when the right time comes
I will kill you So that you might
be born again to life
The only master of your
destiny becoming Circle within circle
The tired reality is closing
Like a flower at dusk
Waiting for the cold dew
Circle within circle
Following the path of the dawn
Through the night crowded
with its dreams In a sacred glade
I woke up Three moons in the
sky I saw On my knees at the foot of
the king's rock I greeted them
Circle within circle
Then into a wolf I turned myself
And in the night I ran away
Circle within circle
Through the eyes of the raven
I saw the rain falling on the world
The entire nature bending
Under the vehemence of the furious wind
That was the time
The favour of the Stone I asked
And they water in ice
Turned in response
Widening their warm mouths
Down they pushed me
Into the great Bear's den
Rich and prosperous land
Of noble blood of ancient
and fighting race made
Through a veil Of dreams never born
Drawing the sword
Their King I challenged
Smiling over there I was taken
Where the mystery of the Springs lies
I drank and under the spell dreaming I fell
It was the wind Primary engine
To give me the knowledge of
the eternal movement Then the earth
A body gave me and the space was limited
The water
Blood became and my dry flesh refreshed
And above all the fire
Of inspiration the main source
Along the black spiral
Where the eternal tree walk on
Up to the roots of the true power
I danced
At the base of the spine
The pillar that sustains the worlds
The great stone have
tuned up a new song
Unlucky you who don't recognize
who gave you life
Small your flame and
Recid your light shall be
If from your land power don't draw
As a new new baby suckling
a right nipple to suck
you should to find
when the thirst for knowledge
your throat will dry
Then you'll become
the voice and the action
Of the earth that made you
And shaping it in return
Under our verb it will be
We the forgotten gods
Stronger than ever we will be back
When the track is beaten
And the great stones
once again will be honoured
So the vision began
The great wolf of the night roused
And a deep slash cracked open the primordial ice
I saw him coming from the north
The father of all gods Two crows next to him
Two wolves at his sides
In the grey cape wrapped I saw him coming
With the name of all things in his hand
He widened the big eye this he said WAR
To Odin sacrificed Myself to myself
On that tree of unknown roots grown
Nor bread nor drinking horn was given
Towards the ground my look I cast
The runes I picked up Shouting I took them
And from up there I fell
The eye shut itself And from his hand I fell
The human error I understood
Almost no soul to sustain me
As if an infernal wind wanted
To tear it away from me
As too great was the Chaos at the beginning
Now too great was the order
The great millstone of the sky
A new circle was about to be prepared
It was time for war
will you hurt me again God is dead crucified his
bastard son took his place on the cross Now Mary
his place on the cross Sucking on my cock is it
ripping out your uterus
up show no mercy YOU BITCH DIE

my bloody pit of horror
the blood of my God Maggotriddenhumanfeast
Tears fall tomorrow in autumn sun brigade
Fear
Pain
And the ever falling rain
Pray for the dawn when the colors start to fade
Still
Yearn for the everlasting flame
Turn to me
Bless the sun
All of this is sane
Turn from me
Start to run
None of this is saved
Life for the promise all fortune come today
Graceful we wander through a life of grey
Remember when the orchids dream
Try to save the blood that's falling from you
Will you be there in war and grief
And try to speak the word of God
Symbols of horror in handsome masquerade
Still
No mortal soul to resignate
Wake from the coma you've chosen to create
Pay for your solace
And a life in vain
Still call my name
Drown your heart
The orchid sky is dead
Take my blame
Fall apart in tides of no regret
Kill the pain
Hide the scars
The orchids die now
Fallen we are
Pale horizon
Meet me when the waters gain
Out in the dark
Fear of the night
So constantly afraid
Sunken we are
Storm arising
Leave me when the fortune breaks
Spill all my blood
Holy water
Scarlet serenade
And then my world decays
Thoughts mistaken
Hearts forsaken
Pain has taken over
Fire nation
Torn relation
Pain has taken over
Servants we are
Sail the oceans
Leave me in the silent waves
Follow me not
Through walls of fire
Leaving is a state
I take your punishment
My pain at your command
Serpents we are
Words of reason
Fear me when illusion fails
Out on the run
Slaves of mourning
Your mercy came too late
Burning we are
Nights on fire
Craving for life's bitter taste
Sorry we are 
Worn and tired
Unable to create
I start to run
And then my world decays
In your eyes
Fell the rain of a thousand years
In your smile
Burns the pain of a million fallen tears
In your mind
The shades of the fear that dreams went wrong
All your life
Played part in a scene you don't belong
Only the night can save
We were lost before the start
Only this time we break
And forever torn apart
We'll never meet again
In your eyes
Fell the rain of a thousand years
In your heart
Lies the doubt of a million wasted tears
In your thoughts
So aware we ignore that dreams corrode
All your life
Try to walk under seals of all the load
See the pain in your eyes
No more will I take it
See the pain in your smile
Right here I will break this
In your eyes
Found the rain of a thousand years
In your smile
Lies the pain of a million fallen tears
Only the silent rain
Know we're lost before the start
Only this time escape
And forever torn apart
We'll never meet again
Down in the city lights of God
No more the circle turns to break
And in our moral lies we yearn to relate
For all the beauty that you're not
And all the plans you never made
In our bleak decay pretend to elate
One by one
Escape the dead
One day one day
Our souls will leave the grey
One day one day
The everlasting gray
One day one day
We always fear the downfall
While we are sinking down in shame
And we await our chance to fear and remain
We are the watchers of our fall
We wait for trains that never leave
And in our robot minds we yearn to believe
One by one
Escape the dead
Your tragedy is God
Lay your head
Down in plastic water
Lay your head
Words as fake as life can be
Words as grey as misery
Words as frail as love can be
Pandemonium
For the pain that's yet to come
Fear will lead you
To the outside of the storm
Sanctimonium
For the flood is yet to come
Pain will guard you
When the water's overrun
Black horizon
For the night will bring new rain
Pale disorder
For the souls impure and sane
In the order
Of annihilation's game
Greed will lead you
And unhallowed by thy name
Dance to the beat of a broken heart
Paint with the colors of a dying art
Sing to the tunes of a fallen song
Thy kingdom gone
Master and slave to the sun upon
Crawl on your knees when the fallout comes
Shine in the light of a fading sun
Thy kingdom gone
Blasphemy
Inside us all
For the end comes closer
You walked the path of light
For all these years
So paralyzed your god
Beneath your fears
Dance to the beat of a broken heart
Paint with the colors of a dying art
Sing to the tunes of a fallen song
Thy kingdom gone
Master and slave to the sun upon
Crawl on your knees when the fallout comes
Shine in the light of a fading sun
Thy kingdom gone
Come sail the seas on a sinking boat
Dive to the ground in perdition mode
Thine is the earth but the loss my son
Thy kingdom gone
Trust in the speech of a twisted tongue
Pay for a life that you don't belong
All that remains in the end is none
Thy kingdom gone
Cross me
Possess me
Cause failure is my name
Guard me
Protect me
And out of the dark comes the pain
Trust me
Inhale me
Rejection is the game
Drown me
Escape me
And out of the dark we arise
Father
Come guide me
To heaven high above
Mother
Don't blind me
In darkness I once rose
I pray for you
In words before you leave
Someone will pray for you
In worlds of no believe
I pray for you
The words impure to speak
Hate me
Forsake me
For certain is my fall
Still me
Mislead me
And out of the cold we arise
Father 
Come hide me
From heaven high above
One day
You'll find me
In paradise unborn
I pray for you
In words before you leave
Someone will pray for you
In worlds of no believe
I pray for you
The words impure to speak
Miss Fortune is her friend
Everytime she's alone
How long how long
The river to take her home
Miss Fortune was her friend
And a serpent indeed
How sad Lord how sad
To know we will never meet
Miss Fortune was her friend
Though she hurt her all the time
How long Lord how long
Will we endure the night
The ocean so wide
The water so deep
With mountains to climb
There's no time to weep
The was rope so tight
The blade cut so deep
Miss Fortune so wise
Has brought her to sleep
Miss Fortune was her friend
Everytime she's alone
How long Lord how long
The river to take her home
Trapped in solemn cries
Together weave departure
For all tomorrow's lies
We never walk alone
Inhale the world's demise
The ashes of our martyrs
Swear alone forever contemplate
Fear no more and celebrate the end
Don't Leave Alone
Feel redemption here
The ones who lead to follow
The sense of borrowed life
I never meant to care
Restrain your world's decline
The ashes of betrayal
Take no more together isolate
Swear no more and tolerate the end
We crossed the borderline
As ones who take good care
Before all fortune lies
Colossal shaped despair
Don't Leave Alone
Come down my child
Take me to the core of the flame
The world denied
Poisoned by the turn of the game
Come rest my child
Take me to the heart of the flame
Calm down my child
Tell me about the scent of the rain
Something has died
Silent and in absence of pain
Calm down my child
Stagnancy is bliss for the sane
Out in the rain
Take all my pain
Save me for the world won't stop
Scars to remain
Cursed by thy name
Your tears are violent
No sleep all night
Run from the fight
Take another break and stop
Burned by the night
Die by my side
Serpents lead the silent
Out in the fear
Can't save a tear
Swallowing a serpent's kiss
Breakdown is near
Words disappear
Restrain to follow
Out in the cold
Lie to be told
Anger is the devil's bliss
Silence is gold
Trust to be sold
Serpents lead the hollow
For my enemies
Fighting is salvation on guard
You don't deserve my hate
For my enemies
I spit on your defense
Scars in my head
Stars for the sad
We're nothings on a line that's crossed
Run from the past
No pain to last
Ignore the sirens
Silence is mine
War down my spine
And my all ambitions lost
Wait for the time
And walk straight in line
Replicate the silence
And as I wake up in the open sea
Try to cure what's left of Eden
And as I call the sense of your belief
Your vengeance is not mine
And for the poison in the air I breathe
Try to save what's left of reason
For all the fear I left behind
And one day I'll return
For my enemies
Welcome my friend
You're in the eye of the storm
Pray for the world descends
And the serpents are born
And we thought Jesus felt regret
Break down my friend
Awake when Morpheus calls
In trance we await the end
To tear the white off the walls
Now let's pretend the world is dead
And Judas better stayed in bed
And when the night calls
We're all the same
Drown our souls in neon rain
And when the night comes
Relieve the pain
Drown us all in neon reign
Welcome my friend
The burning bridges are torn
The ashes of firmaments
Will pour down at dawn
And then the fire leads our hands
And Judas left the promise land
God's creation a dead nation
Hail sedation
Diabolic and robotic
Hail narcotic
Tell me my friend
Is that the price for the kill
Now we make nemesis undone
And face the barrel of a gun
Dressed in the chains we've chosen to strife
We got to pray for severance
Wake in disgrace of the fate in our hands
We got to pay remembrance
It sleeps in the heart of every man
We all need our innocence
Blessed with the pain we have chosen to hide
Below the wheels of reverence
Where can we meet when the war left behind
We got to leave in difference
Swear this morning lights the hour
Embrace a different sky
Divide the sun from the blind
Swear your sorrow blinds the hour
Inhale a different light
Divide the stars from the night
The river flows the morning cries the end
The wind won't blow to sanctify defense
The tears you show are violation sent
Swear this morning lights the hour
Embrace a different sky
Divide the sun from the blind
Swear your morning light devours
To wave the world goodbye
Nothing exists until it is observed
Can consciousness be transferred will brewer
prove that it can be done
Not reliant on breathing or the body
with which you were born
Nothing exists until it is observed
March
Marching on through the fields of dead
Stretching across the whole universe
Connections of all that can be to infinity
Now
Now you are facing certain death
The questions go round in your head
Do choices you make mean a thing
How will you die
Infinite Entanglement
Tough times never last though people always do
Choose to abandon the fear of your own death
Accept a future you can hold in own your hand
For a man
I will live for a thousand years
I will live for a thousand years
No more will I be ruled by fear
I will live for a thousand years
Removing all your fear of mortality
A million precious moments can survive eternally
With a mind that will endure and overcome
For a man
I will live for a thousand years
I will live for a thousand years
No more will I be ruled by fear
I will live for a thousand years
One look is all it takes you to decide what I am
Without hearing a single word I speak
You think you know everything about me who I am
The mutant joke the tinman the crazy freak
Human
Am I human
I am man I am machine
You just don't know what it means
To be human
Am I machine or am I flesh and blood
Which one of them is not sustaining me
Human
Am I human
I am man I am machine
You just don't know what it means
To be human
Human
Am I human
I am man I am machine
You just don't know what it means
I am man I am machine
I accept now what is me
I am human
I am human
I am me
I start to wonder if it is still here
As I sit here with my back to the sun
Waiting for the solar flames to come
Two more days til the light speed
The third day comes and I am hoping now
I wont face all these years alone
I think of her and I start to question
What this mission really means for me
What will come will come
Without my permission or my choosing
You just cant be sure of anything at all
Except uncertainty
Another day til light speed
The 5th day comes
Waking from my first deep sleep
Everything seems sharper and more real
I feel it grow soon it will light up my wings
The coronal mass ejection here
What will come will come
Without my permission or my choosing
You just cant be sure of anything at all
Except uncertainty
This is my life theres no waking up all of
This is real
You can take it all
All thats left behind is the dust we are
Made from
What will come will come
Without my permission or my choosing
You just cant be sure of anything at all
Except uncertainty
This is my whole life
Theres no waking up all of this is real
You can take it all
All thats left behind is the dust we are
Made from
What will come will come
And it will come
What will come will come
And it will come
And now I fly at light speed
I dont know if I can survive
Can I hold my own when all that is left of me
Is what I can hold in my mind
I dont waste time feeling sorry for myself
Now I have put all that behind
Its never easy and its never fair
Im determined they wont win this time
Stars are burning
Burning pure and bright
Stars are burning
Burning in your eyes
Burning all your life
Burning you alive
Everything is changing all of the time
And there is so much beyond my control
Ill make my own life Ill make it mean something
Even on my own
Massive and permanent theyre magnificent
Burning in the eternal night
Now feel them moving creating destroying
And know everything is alive
Stars are burning
Burning pure and bright
Stars are burning
Burning in your eyes
Burning all your life
Burning you alive
Eagle guide me through this life
Eagle guide me through this night
The dream has come to life
Ive lost my way I dont know who I am
After all taken there is not much left of me
Ive seen their face hard just like the stone
I never sleep I never feel awake
They can make you feel like you just cant win
Can you hear me in the endless night alone
Im calling
Im calling you home
You sense this thing that they cant control
They dont know you they dont know your mind
They try to bind your hands and feet with rope
They make from lies
Can you hear me in the endless night alone
Im calling
Im calling you home
I fly through space with the weapons of my time
I cant go back and now I dont want to try
I feel a billion souls surround me in this night
Im calling
Im calling you home
Can you hear me in the endless night alone
Im calling	
Im calling you home
Can you hear me	
Im calling you home
Can you hear me in the endless night alone
Im calling	
Im calling you home
As though I see through eyes that are not mine
Get what you have always got and lie to everyone
Dark Energy
In the fear of memories that dreams may bring
The realization of my transferred consciousness
I am unshackled from my own mortality
Get what you have always got and lie to everyone
Dark Energy
And if they beat me down then I will rise again
So here I stand alone with nothing left to lose
And all the storms of life will now stop me
Taking my revenge
Everything I took for granted appears to be gone
In the mirror I see someone I dont recognize
And now in this place I stand alone
Independence
And now in this place I stand alone
Independence
From them all
See the fall
And if they beat me down then I will rise again
So here I stand alone with nothing left to lose
And all the storms of life will now stop me
Taking
Independence
From them all
See the fall
Rise again live without fear
Where are you
You said my truth must be this
Decided dictated for me be you
Im denied I am cold this ghost whispers loud
From a shadow in the ruin of a mind on his own
Where are you
You said in space between space
There will be an answer waiting for me
Can you see the future from where you are now
Can you see the truth of what youve done to me
Remembering the mornings and each dawn of shame
The rising sun did not shine our sins away
Here I am
Here I am
Here I am where are you
The force guiding the stars you and me too
Beyond words beyond thought Im connected to you
Here I am
Here I am
Your work of anger
white hand prevails
In the garden of human plants
There is a lot of hidden thorns
No one likes them because the bring pain
Pain or truth No matter they hurt the same
I am the thorn of Darkness
Reflection man's true nature
I came to this dying world
To celebrate upcoming end
journey where sounds of horns summon him
us
follow the ravens in the sky
Blood for blood Fire for fire Death for death
Armoured man by armoured man
They stride step by step
Sword by sword shield by shield
They're marching in silence
Over the horizon dark clouds appear
It's cold and clouds of steam hover over us
We are marching silently
We are overwhelmed in thoughts
Marching for victory
Hate and wrath burn our hearts
Our thoughts echo in the space
Into the battle we go to win
honour and pride Shall encourage all of us
The same blood runs in our veins
But our brothers' minds are poisoned
Their spirit should be purified
Enemies' temples burnt to the ground
Nothing can deafen voice of blood
Instinct decodes every lie
Strong arms will soon throw down the chains
And bring the lost dignity back
of heritage that every man has to protect
We are the last bastion of truth
Those who have never betrayed their roots
The heathen fire of our hearts
Can only raise but never go out
We take an oath on our swords
To raise them when it's time to fight
When alien offend our faith
And spit on forefathers' grave
Passed away in this place
I see the snow falling on my face
But I am not able to throw it down
I see my eyes closed
And mouths congealed in pain
They will never say anything anymore
Winds bring the black clouds
Soon the thick snow will fall
Wind Hide my dead body
I hear my persecutors are coming
and went into the woods
aren't hungry
The wind was blowing through their hair
And night was falling down
Sit alone here in the dark
And scratch the paint from the walls
Ringing deep inside my head
Is starting to splinter my skull
It resonates from below
And echoes mental stillbirth
Crawl myself to the source
To be with it south of the earth
Compassion trampled away
I'll laugh when it finally dies
Psychosis becomes my deliverance
Seduced by the truth in her lies
Born of the wrong kind of family
Too happy to pass on their curse
Pass me a shovel or spade
So I can bury them south of the earth
Usher yourself to my madness
The night man will show you a chair
Observe as I stare into space
Oh what am I watching out there
A face a memory illusion or dream
That's crying for all that its worth
Seeking redemption from jaws of contempt
Maybe its south of the earth
Seeking relief from the bonds of grief
Seeking the lie hidden in the belief
Seeking delight in the aftermath of blight
Could it be south of the earth
Hail to the hallucination  come here to placate
But how much longer  how much longer
But how much longer  how much longer
How much longer can the strain conceal the pain
Hail to unconsciousness  altered and benign
It cannot heal but I can't feel so I don't care
But how much longer  how much longer
How much longer inside can this monstrosity hide
But how much longer  how much longer
How much longer must I wait to release my hate
Hail to the clarity  a hammer in my head
Hail to the chemicals  ingest my final escape
But how much longer  how much longer
How much longer in this state will I be awake
Washed away  wishing  pleading
Begging crying dying lying for another day
Laid to rest
broken bloody dying soul
I allowed you a taste of life so sweet
Silence  the final clue  He has forsaken you
On the day of the beast the sun rose in the east
With a glow that just seemed wrong
He frowned at the sky and his heart said goodbye
To a home where he'd no more belong
The wind from the west had his weakness assessed
Lightning thunder and rain
The bracing of foot was a hope burned to soot
The wind and the rain brought his bane
With valiant fight he rose to his might
In an effort to turn back the horde
Then in dismay it all washed away
Betrayal he'd feel evermore
Beaten and down he looked all around
The beast now blocked out the sun
His wounds open bled  spirit near dead
He realized the end had begun
With warmth that's remembered by none
He sits there alone with a heart turned to stone
As dreams fall away one by one
The beginning has ended with force full intended
And trust that has withered away
The ending is here and now hope disappears
The beast has proclaimed disarray and pain
The curious would wish to look upon you
The keyhole would reveal an empty room
Escape the fifteen years you spent in there
Your first look at the Dunwich countryside
Footprints form but there is nothing there
Your lot in life  a plague unfurled
Passed down  wizard brother you unto the world
Cries are silenced 'neath the wreckage
Mercifully they're spared Cthulhu's call
A fortunate reprieve from Armageddon
Signed in blood when you crushed down the walls
To open the door of time and space
Bring the Old Ones to this place
His audience you seek  reunion on the peak
Eradicate mankind from Mother's face
Daylight breaks as you begin ascension
Watched in horror by a frightened town
They can't see you but fix on your pursuers
Desperation as you're hunted down
A chemical discovered by your brother
Brings your form into the naked eye
Shattering the air with screams and terror
The incantation chanted makes you die
Something whispers my name
I answer but no one can hear
Picked up off the floor  thrown inside a door
See it close behind
Dim light on the walls  shadows in the halls
Ministry unkind
Minions walk alone  cataleptic drones
The eye is in the sky
Forever looking on  an endless sea of pawns
Clinging to a lie
Needle's sting I recognize
Staring down the barrel of eternity inside
Needle's caress  the horror dies
Staring down the barrel of eternity implied
Hands behind my back  cable with no slack
Noose is before me
So long I have fought detrimental thoughts
Tonight they claim victory
Needle pulls me from the dream
I still go on as do the screams
Needle's sting so far removed
You have an invitation
To join me in the velvet darkness
Something calling your name
Don't answer because it might hear
The sadists gather to catch a glance
Of pawns in rows who perform the dance
The thought of rest is a distant glow
A quickfading memory of life long ago
The sadists gather as paradise falls
Its implications are lost on them all
Too lulled into sleep to see past the disguise
Burnin' bones and bedside time
Once again we meet tonight
Get that touch of a magical light
We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break out through the ice
You give us fever
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
To be with you I'd risk a fight
My stick is tight my blood is hot
Let's do it here right on the spot
We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break out through the ice
You give us fever
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
I've been down I've been beat
I've been tossed into the street
Beggin' nickels beggin' dimes
Just to get my bottle of wine
Some say life she's a lady
Kinda soft kinda shady
I can tell you life is rich
She's no lady she's a bitch
They suck my body out
But friend there is no doubt
I'm gonna pay the devil his dues
Cause I'm sick of being abused
Eat the rich eat the rich
Don't you know life is a bitch
Eat the rich eat the rich
Out of the palace and into the ditch
Steal my money steal my car
Took my woman and my old guitar
Runnin' crazy runnin' wild Instant Song Lyrics
Blind alley in my mind
Just can't fight the temptation
It's become my inspiration
Gonna get myself an axe
Break some heads break some backs
They suck my body out
But friend there is no doubt
I'm gonna pay the devil his dues
Cause I'm sick of being abused
Don't stop me
Out of the palace and into the ditch
They suck my body out
Sons of vengeance can you rescue me
They got me tied up to a woe tree
They had me screamin' and alone in the night
The wolves were out and howlin' most of the time
Bleedin' in the night oh bleedin' in the night
Instant Song Lyrics
Swore to be avenged oh swore to be avenged oh
This town gets down everybody turn around
Hey hey it's a hot shot city

Did you read it in the paper
'Bout the danger comin' your way
She'll tear you up at midnight
Killer on the loose get out of her way
Sex machine terrorizin' dream
Lock the door tonight
She's got it all she can walk through a wall
Better run for your life
And in the light of day
In hidin' she will stay
Watch out at midnight
Feel her shadow on your face
Midnite maniac she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac lock your door
Cause she can't be far
Did you hear it on the radio
Crimes of passion makin' the news
It happened after midnight
In your neighborhood could've been you
Sex machine terrorizin' dream
Lock the door tonight Instant Song Lyrics
She's got it all she can walk through a wall
Better run for your life
And in the light of day
In hidin' she will stay
Watch out at midnight
Feel her shadow on your face
Midnite maniac she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac lock your door
Cause she can't be far
Midnite maniac she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac lock your door
She knows where you are
Midnite maniac she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac lock your door
Cause she can't be far
Midnite maniac she's a killer at large
Midnite maniac lock your door
She knows where you are
The show is over you got to go home again
The radio station plays his latest song
It says your way of life is kinda wrong
Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio
The sound of the band has turned you upside down
Instant Song Lyrics
Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio
Do you hear your bedside radio
Turn it on
Turn it on
Turn it on
In the cool cool cool of the morning
That's when I'm coming home
In the cool cool cool of the morning
That's when I'm coming home
Stayed awake all night

Stayed awake stayed awake
All night
Stayed awake
And the music goes round and round
Stayed awake all night
Aaahhh
I am the animal
My god I am the beast
I love to see you bleed
So welcome to my feast
We're serving human flesh
To keep you satisfied
With every bloody bite you eat
Another's going to die
Aaahhh
Don't give me politics
Don't give me public schools
Just keep the cops and tv police
From breaking all the rules
I am the raging bull
No fear no sympathy
Sex and drugs and rock and roll
That's my cup of tea
Ooohhh
Feel the heat
Time to feed
Headhunter
My axe is clean and sharp
And blade is shining bright
She's hungry for her midnight snack
And heads will roll tonight
I am the hunter
Not easy to please
Stand in line she cures their lust
Victims on their knees aahh
HeadhunterOnce I had a dream
And this is it
Once there was a child's dream
One night the clock struck twelve
The window open wide
Once there was a child's heart
The age I learned to fly
And took a step outside
Once I knew all the tales
It's time to turn back time
Follow the pale moonlight
Once I wished for this night
Faith brought me here
It's time to cut the rope and fly
Fly to a dream
Far across the sea
All the burdens gone
Open the chest once more
Dark chest of wonders
Seen through the eyes
Of the one with pure heart
Once so long ago
This night will bring him back to me
Fly to a dream
Deep into a dying day
I took a step outside an innocent heart
Prepare to hate me fall when I may
This night will hurt you like never before
Old loves they die hard
Old lies they die harder
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight
I'm going down so frail 'n cruel
Drunken disguise changes all the rules
Old loves they die hard
Old lies they die harder
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight
Greatest thrill
Not to kill
But to have the prize of the night
Hypocrite
Wannabe friend
13th disciple who betrayed me for nothing
Last dance first kiss
Your touch my bliss
Beauty always comes with dark thoughts
I wish I had an angel
For one moment of love
I wish I had your angel
Your Virgin Mary undone
I'm in love with my lust
Burning angel wings to dust
I wish I had your angel tonight
I wish I had an angel
This is me for forever
One of the lost ones
The one without a name
Without an honest heart as compass
This is me for forever
One without a name
These lines the last endeavor
To find the missing lifeline
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
My flower withered between
The pages 2 and 3
The once and forever bloom gone with my sins
Walk the dark path
Sleep with angels
Call the past for help
Touch me with your love
And reveal to me my true name
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
Oh how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore
Nemo sailing home
Nemo letting go
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
All I wish is to dream again
My loving heart
Lost in the dark
For hope I'd give my everything
Oh how I wish
For soothing rain
Oh how I wish to dream again
Once and for all
And all for once
Nemo my name forevermore
Denying the lying
A million children fighting
For lives in strife
For hope beyond the horizon
A dead world
A dark path
Not even crossroads to choose from
All the bloodred
Carpets before me
Behold this fair creation of God
My only wish to leave behind
All the days of the Earth
An everyday hell of my kingdom come
The first rock thrown again
Welcome to hell little Saint
Mother Gaia in slaughter
Welcome to paradise Soldier
My first cry neverending
All life is to fear for life
You fool you wanderer
You challenged the gods and lost
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
This world ain't ready for The Ark
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
Mankind works in mysterious ways
Welcome down to my Planet Hell
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
This world ain't ready for The Ark
Save yourself a penny for the ferryman
Save yourself and let them suffer
In hope
In love
Mankind works in mysterious ways
Soon I will be here no more
You'll hear the tale
Through my blood
Through my people
And the eagle's cry
The bear within will never lay to rest
Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
White man came
Saw the blessed land
We cared you took
You fought we lost
Not the war but an unfair fight
Sceneries painted beautiful in blood
Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have lived since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land
Our souls will join again the wild
Our home in peace 'n war 'n death
Wandering on Horizon Road
Following the trail of tears
Once we were here
Where we have been since the world began
Since time itself gave us this land

I still dream every night
The restless winds over mountaintops
The unspoilt frontier of my kith n'kin
The hallowed land of the Great Spirit
I still believe
In every night
In every day
I am like the caribou
And you like the wolves that make me stronger
We never owed you anything
Our only debt is one life for our Mother
It was a good day to chant this song
For Her
Our spirit was here long before you
Long before us
A lady with a violin playing to
the seals
Hearken to the sound of calling
Who tied my hands to
the wheel
The zodiac turns over me
Come to me
Somewhere there my fate
revealed
I hear but how will I see
I tied myself to the wheel
The winds talk to my sails
not me
Come to me
Somewhere there my fate
revealed
I hear but how will I see
No more tearstains on the pages of my diary
Tired but unable to give up since I'm
Responsible for the lives I saved
The play is done
The curtain's down
All the tales are told
All the orchids gone
Lost in my own world
Now I care for dead gardens
My song is little worth anymore
Time to lay this weary pen aside
The play is done
The curtain's down
Where are the wolves the underwater moon
The elvenpath the haven of youth
Lagoons of the starlit sea
Have I felt enough for one man's deed
Or is it time to challenge the Ancient of Days
And let the virgin conceive
All the tales
Godlove and rest my soul
With this sundown neverending
The feel is gone yet you ain't gonna see me fail
I am the decadence of your world
I am an eider covered in oil
Happy hunting you doublefaced carnivore
Tell me why
No heart to cry
Hang me high
The music is dead the amen is said
The kiss of faith is what I beg
A loving heart 'n soul for sale
Tell me why
Leave me be
And cease to tell me how to feel
To grieve to shield myself from evil
Leave me be
Od of lies is killing me
Romanticide
Till love do me part
See me ruined by my own creations
Leave me be
Dead Boy's alive but without sense
I need a neardeath experience
Heart once bold
Now turned to stone
Perfection my messenger from hell
Wine turns to water
Campfires freeze loveletters burn
Romance is lost
Lord let me be wrong in this pain
Temporary pain eternal shame
To take part in this devil's chess game
Spit on me let go get rid of me
And try to survive your stupidity
We used to swim the same moonlight waters
Oceans away from the wakeful day
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I'll bleed forever
Scent of the sea before the waking of the world
Brings me to thee
Into the blue memory
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I will bleed forever
Into the blue memory
A siren from the deep came to me
Sang my name my longing
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
Worth everything I may ever be
The Child will be born again
That siren carried him to me
First of them true loves
Singing on the shoulders of an angel
Without care for love n' loss
Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me
Take me
Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home
Every way
Every day
Just another loop in the hangman's noose
Take me cure me kill me bring me home
Every way every day
I keep on watching us sleep
Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve
Of you and me
Forgive the adoring beast
Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I'll be there when you say
Time to never hold our love
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I'll bleed forever
Kerran vain haaveeni nÃÂÃÂ¤hdÃÂÃÂ¤ sain
En pienuutta alla tÃÂÃÂ¤htien tuntenut
Kerran sain kehtooni kalterit
Vankina sieltÃÂÃÂ¤ kirjettÃÂÃÂ¤ kirjoitan
Sinussa maailman kauneus
Josta kuolema teki minusta taiteilijan
Oman taivaan tÃÂÃÂ¤nne loin

Death Makes Artists
Only once I could see my dream
Didn't feel the smallness under the stars
Once I got bars in my cradle
As a prisoner I write a letter from there
My own heaven I created here
Let me get away
My own heaven I created here
Let me get away
Time it took the most of me
And left me with no key
To unlock the chest of remedy
Mother the pain ain't hurting me
But the love that I feel
When you hold me near
The hopes were high
The choirs were vast
Now my dreams are left to live through you
Red Sun rising
Drown without inhaling
Within the dark holds hard
Red Sun rising
Curtain falling
Higher than hope my cure lies
Passiontide
An angel by my side
But no Christ to end this war
To deliver my soul from the sword
Hope has shown me a scenery
Paradise poetry
With first snow I'll be gone
The hopes were high
Red Sun rising
Your death saved me
Red Sun rising
Enchantress came to me
And said meet me at the lake tonight
I hunt this song to the white
Through the shroud of snow I saw paradise
Peace no more lies
Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings
I dream of wolves
With them I run
For me she lengthened the night
I am home
I am in peace
Crestfallen soul
Rest for this night
Love is here
Right here under my wings
A single grain can tip the scale
Amidst the burden the scale will prevail
Showing what's worth being here
Storyteller by a hearth of stone
A white little creature purring me
My childhood kingdom gone in time
The islands filling my mind with blue
The one in speacial heaven's court
All the joy unforgiven by this task
An errant soul homeless and foul
All gone but the will to
Live to tell the tale
The days are filled with anxiety
Frustration one right note a day
Where to find a perfect tune
Just do the work and take a step back
All the joy
An errant soul
Dark chambers of my mind
Locked around the neck of my love
None of you understand
And it doesn't matter
To a broken marionette like me
An errant soul
Oh how I hate my kind
Have it all
Yet wish to die
Not mykind but the kind as you are
Saints in Cain's mask
I love you
I just didOnce again I stand at the end
Of one of these paths
Covered with sand
That retains in its memory
Countless days full of warm sun rays
And brimstones of infernal mystery
I'm falling down onto the ground
Dressed up in the abyss of agony
I'm coming back in my own footsteps
To find out the truth of my life
At the time I was a child
Playing on the beach
With prince that name was Rhama
At some distance in a Slough and plague
With human's hate we took the field
A tower built of my own lives
And I'm sauntering upstairs
Immersed in nostalgic regrets
Face to face with the Truth
Scream is coming through my mind
Scream like ancient voices as ancient as I am
She laughs me silently to scorn
So hard to find her so hard to take her in
Before I've found her graceful visage
A final step
Embraces me from heaven
and flapped his wings
A large drop of dew
Is falling down
I'm going to break in half
 Why 
I'm not thinking
But life is coming into my mind
 I exist 
To live up life
To live up all
To live up energy
To live with it all
The drop's striking the ground
Why should I think
Reflection on the drop
Why should I live
A pity 
Life is coming into my mind
A large drop of dew
Is falling down
I'm going to break in half
But life is coming into my mind
But I'm to die
I know this is the end
I'm squeezing my way alone
Up to my knees 
Through life 
Through death 
A new life 
 A pity 
Life is coming into my mind
I can't get a rid of feeling
That I am going somewhere
Now I know
I've been walking a long time
I can't help my feeling
But I sleep even in the daytime
Now I know
I've been dreaming a long time
I get a strange feeling
When I talk with people around
That I say something
Something I should understand
But it's all right it will pass in time
Now I have no doubt
I am a poet
My poems light flashes
In all minds in all cells
My eyes are crying
They can see love in a distance
 They're making love 
My eyes in a dark of night
To freezing cold
They didn't give in
Twolegged being's worlds
Are split into two halves
 My eyes are crying 
I want to know
Which part of the world I am from
Where I have lived
What I have seen
Look into my eyes
You will find the answer
Black is white
Grey is whiter
 I want to know 
If you want to find something
Set out on a seeking trip
Set fire to water
And spill the flames
Drive the wind through the earth
Sunbeams merge with ice and snow
You may see coloured autumn leaves
Falling on early spring flowers
Then you'll understand
Variety of the world
In its c h a o s
If you want to find more
Set out on a seeking trip
You may experience the male and female
Energies tension and relief
You may bow to your masters
Or you might better pace with your head high
Then you'll understand
The boundaries of this world
You may close your eyes
And discover vast spaces
You may feel how empty evil things are
Every suffering's just vanity
Unknown friend will whisper
To your ear saying his secret
No fight against emptiness you just can fill it
Then you'll understand
There's only one way
One way the way of light
Only the sensitive can see the light
The light is a remedy
Your sense and faith
Are making your decisions
You cannot express it
In the time lapse
You're in love with the life
Music has a curative power
A regular interval of dark
Comes and goes
Night of demons
You know
You're sweltering even in the night
When you sleep
The Earth breathes along with you
It's a morning the day is breaking
Your hour of goodness is coming
A cold sweat all over your body
It's hot as hell in the room
You still remember those years
They've gone a long time ago
But it's all coming back to you
In your dreams
And you have no choice
Night of demons
You know
You're sweltering even in the night
When you sleep
The Earth breathes along with you
She was in your hearts
And she was in your mind
She was in all stinking sewers
But she wasn't satisfied
She breathed the art
And drank sorrow
She felt freedom
But she wasn't understood
I had met her in the reed
She was crying and told me her story
And then she laughed dance and sing
Because no one could understand her
She sang
Dancing I'm dancing dancing
I took off my shoes
And walked around the whole country
Then I saw the sunset
Its laugher too
I came to the reed
My body starts to dance
I'm laughing and singing
Because no one can understand me
I sing
I'm singing and dancing I'm dancing
Dancing I'm dancing
Everything I left behind
The suffering all my sorrows
It all seems to me much easier
Then my loneliness
There is no solace 
I 've just met with misunderstanding
Unable to identify with myself
I have realized
It is all part of my destiny
I can't find my place
There is no solace
Doctor if my body's here
Then my heart is roaming around eternity
It's on the way to death to bliss
But at this very moment
It's being hurt by severe betrayal
When the thought of life is asleep
When everything in my body turns silent
My heart gets out and goes
On a tour of gloomy nights
And then I've had nothing for lots of years
Everything's given away
So I want my poor body to have at least
A light memory of my heart
I'm staring into darkness through closed lids
And although they have locked up my sight
My memory is pulsating
With a star shine on the horizon
And then I've had nothing for lots of years
Everything's given away
So I want my poor body to have at least
A light memory of my heart
It's a life not death
Which is cause me what you called
That strange feeling
The death coloured snow
Which blew over from Far Asia
To melt in Pinning City
To moisten our hearts
To bring our desire and hope back to life
That's our colour
Bloody arms set teeth
Pinning eyes rough feet
The ground is a hell carpet
Burning with thousands of requests
The hell the paradise is ours
Let closed door open open forever
And we'll cease to be other people's slaves
Slaves of things slaves of life
Bells of death started to play
Depreciation of time the explanation of lies
Drowning words can't promise delight
The years of secrecy are gone
Trembling hands call for a Lord
The inversion of time the realization of lies
Burning the shrouds
Of your illuminated souls
It's the embers under our feet
The trails of blood lead me to your shrine
It fades away
Freezing blood under my skin
Words descend into a haze
The inversion of time depreciation of lies
Burning the shrouds
Of your illuminated souls
It's the embers under our feet
The trails of blood lead me to your shrine
It fades away
A strange request followed this call
Bells of death started to play
Depreciation of time the explanation of lies
Drowning words can't promise delight
The years of secrecy are gone
Trembling hands call for a Lord
The inversion of time the realization of lies
Burning the shrouds
Of your illuminated souls
It's the embers under our feet
The trails of blood lead me to your shrine
It fades away
Freezing blood under my skin
Words descend into a haze
The inversion of time depreciation of lies
Burning the shrouds
Of your illuminated souls
It's the embers under our feet
The trails of blood lead me to your shrine
It fades away
The rain soaks my apparels
The wind blow continuously it's cold
A shelter is not visible
Protection seems to be out of reach
The severest way I had to go
The longest way I had to fall
Now all the ties are torn apart
I thought this is the end
The moonlight is fragile
Like the coat of glass all around you
I often injured myself
The scars can not heal anymore
Hopelessly I wander about in town
The scenes repeat time after time
Why is it only the worst I can feel
The severest way I had to go
The longest way I had to fall
Now all the ties are torn apart
I thought this is the end
and a shining flash turns it into daylight
stop your eyes leave their sockets behind
as you think you're going to die
can't move now you are a thunderstruck
it won't take reprisals
god's fingers makes way through the clouds
caught the wrinkling skin of your hands
like ashes and dust start to fly
first blisters the whispers alive
cannot catch tomorrow
poor devils for the good of others
whistling bombs will tear their lives apart
when blast off to genocide
forced to be part of their plans
with shattered tears in your eyes
whistling bombs will tear their lives apart
when blast off to genocide
like a head explodes against a windscreen
burnt the nuclear fire arrives
destroying with the speed of light
it's here in the blink of an eye
mass extermination
the science of aggression
intelligence of evil minds
like a head explodes against a windscreen
burnt the nuclear fire arrives
destroying with the speed of light
it's here in the blink of an eye
mass extermination
poor devils for the good of others
whistling bombs will tear their lives apart
when blast off to genocide
forced to be part of their plans
with shattered tears in your eyes
whistling bombs will tear their lives apart
when blast off to genocide
saved by the bell as red hordes burn in hell
guilty of genocide acquitted of testifying
false transition and political disgrace
guest stars placed in electric chair
ride it proudly you son of a bitch
racist spirit false supremacy
crushed the free men in the name of god
thinker of the enlightened absolutism
wolf in sheep's clothing
piles of corpses are growing before my eyes
of men and tyrants a cloak for their contempt
eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
seeds of anger planted full of hate
brutality assassinate despite it all
exterminate eliminate clean their lives
it's easy to understand god absolves us all
confrontation annihilation desolation
it's time to wake up time to open your eyes
give them a dose of their own medicine
guest stars placed in electric chair
wolf in sheep's clothing
piles of corpses are growing before my eyes
of men and tyrants a cloak for their contempt
tear apart the old chains of cruelty
of men and tyrants shall exist till eternity
for those who thought despitefully
even with a false appearance
even if their hands were clean
for all of them I manifest I swear
in my world you're not a welcome guest
time has you you'd been sinking in quicksand
you were dead before your mother gave birth
I condemn you to roam around these words
for the ones who didn't trust me
even if they said they did
even if they're emptyhanded
for all my rage I'll kick their ass I swear
in your world I am the god who pulls strings
time is mine I put sticks in your spokes
absolutely shattered turned into a relic
can't collect the black ashes of scorn
blown away you're
nothing you're all doomed
by the gears of the clockwork
infecting with the plague
stinking up the atmosphere
filthy trick to play the game
the golden rule is sentenced to death
I say
now I own your soul spinning as it bleeds
when your eyelids open up behind the fog
dead bodies everywhere
rotten guts
it's time for the executioners hooded death
crawling sensations across your head
turn down the lights
don't look back
the evil rises again
bloodshot eyes in front of you
fear is your best friend
courtain moves from side to side
now on with the show
you're alone and nobody's there
let the devil take the hindmost
they want your blood you wanna scream
it makes your hair stand on end
you've been caught you're their first meal
the pain prevents you from the scream
flesh separating from its bones
smell your entrails while they slurp
and burn motherfucker
die with no anesthesia pray for the end
you're gonna become one of them
it's time to hunt again now your first prey
serve yourself as you're starving to death
turn down the lights
don't look back
the evil rises again
bloodshot eyes in front of you
fear is your best friend
courtain moves from side to side
now on with the show
you're alone and nobody's there
let the devil take the hindmost
all I love is dead
promises are lies
all apologies
all of them are false
all I preach is selfdestruction
all I want is not this world
all humanity is lost
all my hate to crush them all
when you cross the line there's no time to cry
I'm your frightening nights
the strange behind the wall
waiting for his prize
reflected in the knife
the cancer of society
dictating rules as it used to be
over your poor minds
I will cast a shadow
when you cross the line there's no time to cry
I live when you die I lie when you swear
I breathe when you expire don't apologize
I hate while you love I rest when you run
I stay once again stronger than all
I'm the antagonist
of the human race
a bullet in your head
blood flowing with grace
fallen idols in your walls
the greatest lie ever told
all of you may die
when I snap my fingers
when you cross the line there's no time to cry
I live when you die I lie when you swear
I breathe when you expire don't apologize
I hate while you love I rest when you run
has been bothering me for a long time man
cruel pig slave of the faith christian renegade
brainwashing mankind
indoctrinate the slaves
a legal sect was built to destroy our reason
this is the word of god

so practise what you preach
brainwashing mankind
indoctrinate the slaves
a legal sect was built to destroy our reason
in my opinion you are wrong
let's get this straight what's going on
you hide the true intentions
behind a cassock behind the fog
exploit their fear in their empty minds
as you're abusing altar boys
my divine law says what to do
I will cut your cock off
first of all don't treat me like a fool
you talk behind my back now say it to my face
you will never see me fall from grace
others like you have passed before my eyes
I don't like you and you've never liked me
so shut your mouth or I'll make you bleed
dogs like you must be on a leash
others like you have passed before my eyes
I don't like you and you've never liked me
so shut your mouth and get down on your knees
are you ready to confront your fate
you know that this won't be the same again
you don't like me and I've never liked you
so shut your mouth or I'll do it for you
my satisfaction is seeing you tonight
my naked fists of pride bringing you fright
don't ask for mercy don't cry like a bitch
lets finish it or get out of my way
and immorality has no other sense for me
if you're a bastard I'm the hate you used to be
I'm your nightmare you try to bleed
are you ready to confront your fate
you know that this won't be the same again
I don't like you and you've never liked me
so shut your mouth or I'll make you bleed
my satisfaction is seeing you tonight
my naked fists of pride bringing you fright
don't ask for mercy don't cry like a bitch
lets finish it or get out of my way
is this some kind of dirty name
is this the highest card is this the end
I said I wanted a break from my routine
the way we were
what things should be
and all our thoughts buried so deep
so different from reality
alone in this room just me with my insanity
alone in this room just me with my insanity
I lost the concern within my soul
the way we were what things should be
and all our thoughts buried so deep
so different from reality
alone in this room just me with my insanity
alone in this room just me with my insanity
I need to leave this place I wanna escape go
the way we were what things should be
and all our thoughts buried so deep
so different from reality
so far from this world so lost where are
alone in this room just me with my insanity
they say that in war there are two sides
allies or oppressors not so different things
a dark concept makes
innocent screams
bad intentions
we can't see inner benefits
one step to reach the end
freedom's like a big chessboard
who will fall and who will stand
money crude oil holy land
what's the excuse this time
war to end all wars
places to do their penance
one side one war
one world to roam
can you see what I see
there's no good planted seed
rooted evil is what they bring inner conflicts
one step to reach the end
freedom's like a big chessboard
who will fall and who will stand
money crude oil holy land
what's the excuse this time
war to end all wars
places to do their penance
one side one war
one world to roam fuck you all
here I am I come back for you
not one for far too long see me that's the truth
did you miss me is you mind erased
maybe you don't remember my face
smell these rotten scars
blood oozed from these wounds
refresh your memory bastard
still no idea
I've promised myself rise again
stupid dumbshit have you ever crapped your pants
I would like to remind you of these words
the end of the calm before the storm
I know what's happened here
now you're kind you are dead
I say I would have revenge
every action has a side effect
you're the one who started this game
the end will correct your mistakes
I've reserved a place in hell
I'll enjoy torturing you to death
now I'm the rapist the killer and the thief
who can shake the foundations of the earth
the force of the sea which sinks a million ships
lament of a kid the hidden creed
the monster in a closet
first and primal scream
the menace of vanity
desires for death
I'm who penetrates the pussy of a nun
eye of the storm putrid flesh feeds the worms
eternal punishment scourge of human kind
I'm the angel's ruin the king of kings
I know what's happened here
now you're kind you are dead
I said I would have revenge
every action has a side effect
motherfucker I feel no remorse
you will rest six feet below

David made a covenant with Jonathan
A promise of trust the spilling of blood
Slaughter the heifer walk between two parts
Off with my head if I break the oath
Mephibosheth
Blood covenant
Jonathan died in battle
David ascend to the throne
Mephibosheth a cripple
Son of Jonathan lost
Left behind as they fled
Oath of death upon David's head
The search went out for Mephibosheth
Caught imprisoned cursing rebel
Brought before King David's throne
Thought that death was imminent
David remembers the covenant oath
He'll show kindness to Jonathan's house
Seen as now the son of the king
All that was Saul's would now be his
You are Mephibosheth
David symbolic of God
Your resisting His throne
The blessing of the blood covenant
Christ died for you you don't even know
Northern Storm invading the heart of my mind
Northern Storm changing the mind of my heart
Northern Storm piercing the ways of my soul
Northern Storm directing the soul of my ways
Total control noone can take this peace away
Invasion of my mind

Do not deny the Power
Of the storm to revive

Perfect plan

Born again
The western world
Is just like Sodom
You'd better change now
Or face judgement

Eternal death

Mortification

Manipulation of other to

Abomination
Those of flesh will see you're false
Christian warfare
Kill the stars exalt the cause
Mass exposure

Hatred wasting mankind racism black and white
Open your eyes see the truth we are all of dust
Blood world the blood of life
Who will care who will unite
Blood world the blood of Christ
All men are equal in his sight
Care share be fair be aware
Christ uniting mankind equal black and white
Open your eyes see the truth hatred is a killer

Here we go down that same old road again
A memory a regret a hope
Here we go down that same old road again
A memory a regret a hope a stimulant
Recent it seems
We must push on we must push on
Though we bleed
We must push on we must push on
In a modest town where honest people dwell
Then you should sit in your backyard
Watch clouds peak over the tallest mountain tops
Cuz they unveil honest opinions about the stars
We must push on we must push on
Recent it seems
We must push on we must push on
Though we bleed
We must push on we must push on
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
I can't even concentrate on this
It's overthought anticipated
The pen ink is running dry
It's been thrown to paper and wasted
Creativity has been blocked and overtasted
Maybe in time I'll appreciate it
Hold on hold on
We'll be with you soon
These papers are stuck in this book
Until they're torn out and pasted
To the inside of my memory
Where they can later be viewed and appreciated
Hold on hold on
We'll be with you soon
We'll be with you
Longing for what has been lost
Longing for what hasn't been obtained
It's a small cost
Forgot the past lost the future only now remains
Hold on hold on
We'll be with you soon
We'll be with you
We're born into silence and let it all be
Lift your anchor and just float astray
Born into silence and let it all be
Fortune in silence
Watch it explode
While fragments of ironies examples fly
And hit the shore
And tyranny's torn
From the podiums where leaders stand
But rule no more
Protest the way we're passive today
Watch it explode
While it's not impossible
For flowers to bloom and grow next to graves
And babies are born
In the same buildings where people go
To pass away
Pass away
Protest the way we're passive today
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
Born into silence and let it all be
Lift your anchor and just float astray
Born into silence and let it all be
Fortune in silence
Distorted and complicated
I'm sorry but its over
Essential to awaken
I'm leaving
Here we are
That's what it's all about
I'm sorry but its over
To love here and to love this
I'm finally breathing
Before you go
There is something more to say
Before you go
There is something more to say
Persistent resentment
I'm sorry but its over
Seduction for destruction
I'm finally breathing
Before you go
There is something more to say
Before you go
There is something more to say
Before you go
There is something more to say
This lonely old man had heart
Resting grey hairs on wrinkled arms
With nothing but a stool to hold up his back
Skinny legs with Japanese mileage
Crossed at the ankles
He's unaware
Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Unaware of his surroundings
Youth it passed
Swarming like wolfs to a fresh kill
The scented tracks
He's just scared about dying
Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave yourself if you want in
It's the only way to understand it
Too bad
Too bad
Too bad
So sad
Days have come to an end
Where all
Where all has been lost
Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave yourself if you want in
It's the only way to understand it
To understand it
The opera is over
Singers have all gone home
Seats are empty
The kitchen is closed
The sidewalks are sprayed down
The blinds are pulled down
The foundation's unstable
The wrecking ball is back
Quiet business vacancy
Quiet business vacancy
Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Symphony's concluded
The instruments are all cased up
The notes are silent
The music's still apparent
Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Spirits are jaded
Art is dying
Is art dead
Art is dying
Is it dead
Believe it
We need it to move on
A one track mind in a one way town
Let's go ahead and gentrify
We let art die with robot minds
Steal the brush and paint boundary lines
A stale kind the people we'll find
Walking in single file line
I think its time to finally rewind
Lets go ahead we might as well
Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Spirits are jaded
I think I'm awake
Rolling on my blanket
I am sinking into the bed
Light around me
Beautful washes of pulsating color
Buzzing white noise
It sounds like one hundred bees
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
Pulsing
You control it
Body's asleep
And your mind is awake
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
White cloth black napkins
Wood chairs surround me
Wood tables foggy sign
In front with no light
Night falls beneath candle light
Cast shadows
Insence fragrance
From the corner of the room
Cloudy senses Stale light below
Beneath me
Night falls beneath candle light
White squalls beneath winter skies
Night falls beneath winter skies
White squalls beneath winter skies
Faceless crowd of elderly beings
Roses sprouting yellow glow
Subconcious into the light
Night falls beneath candle light
White squalls beneath winter skies
Think we know
Oblivious though
Unified clones
Sit like stones
Up on thrones
Of fool's gold
Looking bold
But all alone
Restore our needed shelter
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Pants at my knees
Fading with growth
Lie awake
Buried stones
All alone
Restore our needed shelter
Our flawless endeavors
To be alone
To be alone
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Passing my knees
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Pants at my knees
Fading with growth
Lie awake
Lie awake
Lie awake
The only things surrounding you now
Are the circular memories
Infect your conscience
They are the make up of your worries
Regrets and doubts
Elective betrayal of your person
Radiates confidence
Shine with silence
And shadow the ones below
This drought is leaving me
With cracked soil and brown leaves
Floating on a dry lake bed
With a dry mouth and foggy head
Waiting for the snow
When the water comes
I will overflow
I will overflow
When the water comes
I will overflow
There's one more thing
I forgot to tell you
Worries and doubts
Will only help you
In the long run
You'll shadow the ones below
This drought is leaving me
With cracked soil and brown leaves
Floating on a dry lake bed
With a dry mouth and foggy head
Waiting for the snow
When the water comes
I will overflow
I will overflow
When the water comes
I will overflow
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
I built a wall
It stretched one thousand miles
Set it off
Massacre
It's holding up the roof
Breast feed your heart
Set it off
I saw a distant port
With no water to support
Burning the bridge between
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Never content nor satisfied
Tensions of self
The massacre changed history
Borderline paranoia
Yelling at their own rights
Set it off
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Though half of me is gone
The lonesome heart is there
I cannot find the other half
I cannot find the other half
I cannot find the other half
Another sunrise gone
In the violent ring of a clock
A day we hated from scratch
Labour speed with no pay
No thank you in the years of slavery
Days lost crashlandings
Of dreams and expectations
We scratched the rust
Like we did to our wounds
To see beneath the time lost
Strength once our own
We passed our hopes to the next to come
Who dared stare up at the light
Who defied the god of rotors
Who disturbed the movement of the levers
Who guides the sheep with no eyes
Millions of heartbeats
Yearn the same dream
But none listens to another
None looks at the other
Eyes afraid of souls afraid of death 
Souls live forever 
But nobody remembers anymore 
Who does remember that the fire will burn
That the rain will flood and drown
That the sun will shine tomorrow too
Whether we can see or not
Before me innocence
Protected me shielded me
A false legacy of miasmatic ideas
Of a fanatic father and a subjected mother
The world what is it 
A flashy game
With a beggining middle and end
A royal theatre of tyrants
With a sterile imagination
Newborn whys
On one foot
A punishmet for every question
Answers why 
With the passing years
The moist of philosophy got desiccated
And nothing but dry numbers were left
The world  numbers with simple excellents
Of corrupted teachers a life of yes sir
Why nourished a dream and a reality
In the years that passed
In the age of numbers
The passing age of numbers
The light I cherished has burned my eyes
And so I envied the blind
For they were not
Witness to my downfall
Witness of our downfall
You will find me everywhere
In miserable shows of a cheap broadcast
In the hatred born from ignorance
I am therelurking
On your walks across streets
In words full of promises
Over microphones andpeople
Born parasitically we procreate and
Multiply without interest for your life the
Reality you don't seei have no purpose
I just consume and destroy
So many nulls
In the vastness of the mass
So many nulls
So many nulls
So manyinnocents deceived
They hate and spit
And with the mud
They sculpt the demon
So many nulls
So many nulls
So many of innocents deceived
They hated and spat
And sank in the mud
They had created
Upon pillars of salt
Built to withstand the wrecks of passing time
Not ready to bear the weight
Of human indifference
Now as tongues lick
Mouths get numb
As speech becomes inarticulate
Minds nauseate
Both sides of the coin bear the same figure
Both sides have the same story to tell
The real one fades away as time passes
Leaving nobody behind to remember it
Lies and truth dance around in circles
In a constant change of positions
And at the center stands
The rotor that sets the circle
That engulfs us all
In motion
Forged ages ago
By the blood and sacrifice
Of innocents that died in vain
On the altars of political
And religious confrontations
No regrets no remorse no denials
Dilluted to extinction by the
Soul and conscience workshop
Shapes the shepherds
Guiding to compliance
Those that never tasted life
And never will too
Cause they are meant for fuel to support
The disciples that will guide them
To their final destination
Forget what happens to the sheep
They're bred for slaughter
They're bred to sleep
Shepherds forget they are sheep too
Sole conscience no will schooled into
Lies deceit and public speech
Institute of growing heads
Of states of mind and states of helots
Their hands are clean and washed in blood again
Soulconscience workshop deprival of thought
Mutilates minds by selective erasure
Teachers invisible as in times of old
Teaching lessons of untrue and untold
They deny and so they control
They're in power but they will fall
Gods of labs
Noble vows sworn
Tampered genomes
Picked and torn
Pest and virus sculpted vile
Inside the tubes of hybris
Zeroing down on us
To zero down us all
To zero down our soul
No chance to breathe
Even one last time
Living hell on planet earth
A life with one foot set on death
Nano demons haunt the lives
Of experiment human cattle hives
Lungs are torn apart
Eyes start to bleed
A raging success
A virus indeed
Deadly moleculeS
Are sucked in deep
As one last breath
Cuts sharp the weak
The strong were sculpted
Cleansing has begun
All survivors shall now praise none
The ones that survived
Take the place of those that had fallen
And in their turn hand their place
To the next to fall
Till we all fall
Now cell by cell
Nature denies innoculation
And the next fall
Will be the fall of all
Innoculate your souls
Scientific violence
Hi tech mass murder
Profit 100%
Human loss absolute
Punishment none
No chance to recuperate
Chances of repeating
The same mistakes 100%
Estimated time
Of healing the woundsforever
Death sealed in concrete awaits
The epitaph of logic
Death sealed in concrete
The cenotaph of mankind
A dance of constructed demons
On an earthly hell
A world where science is god
A world where science
Was diminished to gold
Paying with our lives and souls
A debt we have not chosen to partake
In this sphere of obscenity
Every day a new page in the book
Of inhuman history spawned to remember
Is written in human blood
A mother weeps
While she buries her only child
And now poisons her body as she digs the grave
No proper burial
No obituary
Ashes to ashes
To moleculation
To total extinction
Not a single trace of our existence
Will be left behind
Thousands of slaves
Steadily build the pyramid
Get born inside die inside
Fight for the pyramid
Servants dominated
Dominators served
With a limit of expendability
Level of responsibility
Look high up
The top seems to end up nowhere
Yet it will eventually reach an end
Built to withstand the wrecks of time
Parents teach the pyramid
Perception of reality
Protection of descendants
Nothing else in truth
In the truth and the dreams
Of those who choose their way
Despise that's the way things are
Create from nothing
A gaze in the horizon is rejected
Attain a good position in the construction
Prepare yourself early guided
Define your functions
You cannot not belong
To the enormous babelic construction
How will you survive
How will you protect yourself
Yet what an irony
So much blood and so much work
For the last establishment
Of a dead king
The success promised by the creators of nothing
Is a flashy grave for the dominator servants
Dominators served

Human contact
Intimacy relayed
Immense power harnessed
Leashes break
Subjected to digital restrains
Subjected to silence
The new order dictates
Masking confinement with joy
Flee or meet mental defeat
They make you feel alive
Or make you think you are
Possessed the urge comply
Parochial paraplegic minds
New age mental drugs
Sucking up your soul
To live is to consume
In omnivoric outbursts
Confined into oneself
Let others choose for you
Life's a real bitch
The hardest choices are the true ones
As multiple razors/sec
Slash through desiccated brains
A weapon in every home
Inflicts injuries that cause no pain
Fucked up / bent in two / psychotic / psychaotic
Stepped on / crushed / bewildered
Neuroconsumefreakbrainrotting
Bursts of light pierce through virgin eyes
Overloading infant brains
Suppressing minds lobotomising
With electric impulse strains
There's no pain in the procesS
The seeds were set into
Watered with chemicals
Nothing grows
Something was buried
To be buried once more
The purity of what was ment to flourish
Becomes a morbid harvest of the dead
A lesson in pain
Taught to the ones who cherished those lives
As their own flesh and blood
Lessons in pain
Lessons in vain
Now drugged up to the eyeballs
Withered by pain in a dark corner
The trip turns into a journey
To the threshold where the planes
Of existence meet
Tearing down the last strongholds
Of internal cerebral resistances
The waging war comes to an end
The essence pours and the soul flees
Piece by piece
The road taken
Falls apart to the point of no return
Hears are shed
Hearts grow cold
The bitter sweet taste
Of this world
Others laugh making a profit out of it
Enjoying silence while born deaf
Serene being blessed with infliction
Born sick in an already sickening world
Nature does not avenge it goes with the flow
We have midlessly distorted
To serve our greed and evolving species
Evolution is respect in all things
Something we lost
Something that few remember
And even rare few live by
Now as everything deteriorates
We try to fathom the reasons why
While being right in front of our eyes
Pretend we need to figure out why
While why eludes consciously our conscience
In order to wipe the guilt clean from our hides
Balance of effect
Born sick
Balance of effect
Already sickening
And with it rots the environment
We need to support our existence
As we poison and strip it clean
Of all resources
Just for the sake of pure profit
Giving jack shit about the comming
Generations that will face
The planet we turned into a whore
And like a whore it will pass the disease
Onto them as they fuck the planet too
Pure air holds new beginnings
Seize the moment bravery shows
You can make it on your own
Dead clocks have spun today
I realized my negative traits
Perfect imperfections
Good sight on my direction
Time to pick up the pace
When will you learn from your mistakes
Don't feed the sadness inside
Lift up your chin
Hold up your pride
Some days you'll feel alive
Other days you'll feel like you've died
One foot in front of the other
All the signs point straight ahead
You're stronger in the end
I constantly see the devil inside me
I've constantly been surounded by tragedy
I'll break free
Open your eyes to the dawning skyline
Pure air holds new beginnings
Seize the moment bravery shows
You can make it on your own
Cast out the doubt inside your heart
Reverse the curse
This can be worse
Cast out the doubt inside your heart
Reverse the curse
This can be worse
I won't let them take me
Hush your fear
The demons are approaching near
Hush your fear
The path has now become so clear
You'll be stronger in the end
I constantly see the devil inside me
I've constantly been surounded by tragedy
I'll break free
Open your eyes to the dawning skyline
Pure air holds new beginnings
Seize the moment bravery shows
You can make it on your own
I'm out of breath nothing's left inside my chest
We're out of time
And if I could rewind it I wouldn't mind it
We only get one shot
Let's take a chance give it our all
And one for nothing one for nothing
We're only young once
Let's make mistakes make some noise
And make history
You can't hold us back
Raise hell Raise hell
I feel alive the chance of a lifetime
Raise hell Raise hell
So alive you can't hold us back
This is the time to attack
Don't count me out or you can count your doubts
And I won't go back
A world so empty
I'm out of breath nothing's left inside my chest
We're out of time
And if I could rewind it I wouldn't mind it
We'll make history we'll make history
It's tearing my mind apart at the seams
A struggle with what I believe
I'm at war covered in blood and sweat
I'm at war with a demon inside my head
I'm at war with a lifetime of regret
But I'll fight back this is my time to attack
Fight back
This is your time to attack
Show no love for the enemy
Just animosity for the respect they lack
Erase the past mistakes that'll break me
Break through the walls that haunt me back
I'm out of breath nothing's left inside my chest
We're out of time
And if I could rewind it I wouldn't mind it
Learn from yesterday live for today
There's hope for tomorrow
The dawn of a new day
Learn from yesterday live for today
There's hope for tomorrow
The dawn of a new day
We'll make history
You can't stop us now
Reap what you sow
You think you're so tough
You pushed you shoved
Made my life so rough
Enough is enough
Wake up open your eyes and see
The hate that flows inside me
My bones were once made of glass
Every day I used to break
Now they're all made of steel
Built from when I would feel broken
So throw your punches at me
And I'll hit back in return
I see the fear in your eyes
Some people never learn never learn
The tables can turn
Wake up open your eyes and see
Karma's a motherfucker
You did this to yourself
Have you had enough
You did this to yourself
Have you had enough
I'm not a victim of your insecurities
Do not pour that on me
There's no remose for the weak
I've said it once I won't say it twice
Stand up for yourself
Take back your life
My bones were once made of glass
Every day I used to break
Now they're all made of steel
Built from when I would feel broken
My bones were once made of glass
Every day I used to break
Now they're all made of steel
Built from when I would feel broken
Leave your past behind don't look back
You can only move forward in time
Free from the chains that hold you down
There is nothing that can stop us now
Free yourself from walking in their footsteps
There is nothing that can stop us now
Collapse dead again
Another night we'd like to forget
So sorry for your pain
But it's the choice you made
Know you will never be my downfall
Out like a light sleep so peacefully
Feels so familiar no need to panic
A coward's life lies with the easy route out
Lay low in the arms of the charmers
A false caress of care
You know it all too well
But I know there's a way out
When all is lost I'll be the guiding light
The tides can turn I see hope in sight
I will never let them pull you under
When all is lost I'll be the guiding light
There's a horizon still shining bright
Don't let the charmers pull you under
I will never let them pull you under
A drifter's eye sifting through the static
Where do you call home when you feel alone
A fractured mind scarred and scared to die
Oh brother help me find my place in time
I see the weakness your guilt is my crutch
Don't be the victim you can save yourself
I'm by your side but I will not stand by
And watch you let yourself die
When all is lost I'll be the guiding light
The tides can turn I see hope in sight
I will never let them pull you under
When all is lost I'll be the guiding light
There's a horizon still shining bright
Don't let the charmers pull you under
I will never let them pull you under
The drifter's eye sifting through the static
Where do you call home when you feel alone
A fractured mind scarred and scared to die
Oh brother help me find my place in time
When all is lost
When all is lost
Save yourself
Don't be the victim
You can save yourself
Don't be the victim
You can save yourself
Your cries of white
Don't match the black of your eyes
Oh and the fire you ignite
Won't burn away the lies
'Cause the storm is threatening
To wash it all away
Don't swear to me
You're not what you pretend to be
And I won't be there to pick up the pieces
Can you feel the gravity of your words
Gather on your back now
Can you feel the gravity
And it hurts to learn your precious words
Are worthless as they burn away
Burn away
All choked up
Learn to bite your tongue
Burn away
Inhale the smoke
Black heart black lungs
And it hurts to learn your precious words
Are worthless as they burn away
Away
Away
Away
The storm is approaching the shore
Drowning away
I hope you never see the sun again
When the flood begins to pull you under
You can swear to the rain that you'll change
It won't save you now
Can you feel the gravity of your words
Gather on your back now
Can you feel the gravity
And it hurts to learn your precious words
Are worthless as they burn away
From the bottom of my black heart
I hope you never see the sun again
From the bottom of my black heart
I hope you never see the sun again
From the bottom of my black heart
I hope you never see the sun again
Here we are at the bottom can we rise again
Will we ever escape this place
A new low slipping further into the cracks
Deep down I wish I could take it all back
Oh I've done it now
I wish the cold would break
I need the sun's embrace
But it set so long ago
Will it ever rise again
When the stars fall down on me
I realize that the little things are meaningless
And they're the reasons why we lie to ourselves
When the skies crash down on me
I realize that I've lost my inspiration
Now it's clear it's the fear inside
That's brought this nightmare to life
It's never easy it seems
Am I the only one who battles these monsters
Underneath the surface
Why do they pull at me
They scream the same dark words
With their sick dark mninds
There is a place in hell reserved for your kind
There is a place in hell reserved for their kind
So let go
Of all the hooks you've embedded in me
Breathe in the cold air
Let it chill to your bones
I wish I was there in your time of distress
'Cause I'm a mess on my own
And how it hurts to hate
Everything I've grown to hold so near
But I'll find strength when it all collapses
I promise you dear
When the stars fall down on me
I realize that the little things are meaningless
And they're the reasons why we lie to ourselves
When the skies crash down on me
I realize that I've lost my inspiration
Now it's clear it's the fear inside
That's brought this nightmare to life
Is this the hand that fate has dealt us
Worse and worse day by day
Here we are at the bottom can we rise again
Will we ever escape this place
There's no escape
Oh
There is only suffering
When will I find my peace
No one can save me
Nightmares brought to life
Save me from myself
Nightmares brought to life
Save me from myself
Breathe in the cold air
Let it chill to your bones
I wish I was there in your time of distress
'Cause I'm a mess on my own
And how it hurts to hate
Everything I've grown to hold so near
But I'll find strength when it all collapses
I promise you dear
Oh
From the very start
Was it really all for the music
From the very start
This was your dream and now you'll lose it
All these bad intentions
How can you not give back
When they gave you their all
This used to be about passion what happened
Tell me what the fuck happened
This used to be about passion
Did sincerity go out of fashion
Oh they'll find you
It's not safe to stay in the bed when you lay
The wolves are at the door
But everyone's got a price
There's a price on your head
This is the price you pay
Deceiveers and thieves
Intoxicated with greed
Deceivers and thieves
Where is your dignity
Fake smiles you're nothing without them
We see through you we see through you
Don't you recognize that face in the mirror
Your life is a lie can we be any clearer
This used to be about passion what happened
Tell me what the fuck happened
This used to be about passion what happened
Did sincerity go out of fashion
So sleep with the lights on
'Cause they'll find you
Oh they'll find you
It's not safe to stay in the bed where you lay
The wolves are at the door
They're hunting you down
This is the price you pay
They're hunting you down
This is the price you pay
This is the price you pay
Enjoy the company of guilt company of guilt
When will you learn your lesson
Don't burn the bridges they so carefully built
Don't take advantage of their obsessions
So sleep with the lights on
'Cause they'll find you
Oh they'll find you
It's not safe to stay in the bed where you lay
The wolves are at the door
Have I been awake
Consciously designing ways
To get me to a better place
Or was I in a daze
And weeks slip away and then repeat
If it's so then wake me up
Wake me up
Have I walked along
The path I swore I'd walk upon
Or have I somehow led myself astray
Or was I in a daze
And weeks fade away with memories
Before I'm old with nothing left to love
Wake me up
And pull me from
The fog that's keeping me numb
Wake me up
'Cause I've become
Comfortable with feeling nothing
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Have I been awake
Consciously designing ways
To get me to a better place
Or was I in a daze
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Waste away and vanish in the flood
Can we address the situation for a second
I feel the rush in my feet
Oh the anxiety
So vulnerable that even I can see
We've let a ghost into our home
The strangers we call our friends
Are always the first to cast their stones
So simpleminded
No need to pretend
In the end
Forgotten
Will they remember you
When the lights go out
Forgotten
Will they be there for you
When your time runs out
Don't feed me these fucking lies
Drag my name in the mud for the last time
How I despise your kind
Hollow words hollow thoughts
They will never break me
Hollow words hollow thoughts
They will never break me
Oh so simpleminded
No need to pretend
In the end
Forgotten
Will they remember you
When the lights go out
Forgotten
Will they be there for you
When your time runs out
I see no escape
I see the brightness of stars wither away
Oh you could've been so much more
But it's the path you take
That will lead you to this early grave
We will all forget you
We will all forget you
We will all forget you
We will all forget you
We will all forget you
We will all forget you
It's not your fault that I lost today
I only blame the choices that I made
It's not your fault that I lost today
I should have listened to what you had to say
They granted hope that I didn't have
Stripping my courage that I wanted to bad
Long distance in front of you
Between thoughts you said you'll go through
You'll be ok
Do what you have to do
The journey of thousands of miles
Begins with a single step
Don't give it up
Begin to make changes in yourself
There is no one there but you
Can't you tell
Don't give it up
I know everything seems so strange
There's nothing normal in this day of age
Live loud
They granted hope that I didn't have
Stripping my courage that I wanted to bad
I'm stuck in a room floating with my reflections
Spinning around in different directions
The ones who care
Are the ones who listen
I cannot feel or have intent have intent
My heart has been ripped from my chest
I'll let time heal me and I'll do the rest
Oh
The journey of thousands of miles
Begins with a single step
Don't be afraid to live your life till the end
Be afraid that it will never begin
Don't give it up
Begin to make changes in yourself
There is no one there but you
Can't you tell
Don't give it up
I know everything seems so strange
There's nothing normal in this day of age
Of all the tongues that speak my name
Your smile speaks them louder
Your smile speaks them louder
Of all the tongues that speak my name
Your smile speaks them louder
Your smile speaks them louder
Just 'cause you see it
Fade in the final hour
It doesn't mean it
Never was at all
Just 'cause you see it
Fade in the final hour
Well it doesn't mean it
Was ever meant to fall
Just 'cause you see it
Fade in the final hour
It doesn't mean it
Never was at all
Just 'cause you see it
Fade in the final hour
Well it doesn't mean it
Was ever meant to fall
You were just a mistake
Nothing I had planned for nothing I wanted
You ruined everything I had
Just know I wanted you dead
There is no god
There is no heaven
And love is just a word we say
Don't get this confused
Can't seem to block this
I keep looking back
Keep moving backwards
I'll wish you dead till it's done
There's nothing for you here
I keep you locked and shoved away
You'll stay so far away from me
I am the devil
I am your lack of sleep
God can't help you now
She was just a mistake
I never loved her
I never needed her
She was your last hope but it's my turn
I waited for this
There's nothing for you here
I'll keep you locked and shoved away
You'll stay so far away from me
You are not my son
I am not your father
Just know one thing
I wanted you dead
There's nothing left here
I wasn't sure if I should stay or go
I had covered for you for way too long
This isn't how it's supposed to be
And it's taken it's toll on me
I'm so disgusted with myself
You told me they'd never find out
They wouldn't care they wouldn't believe me
I hope you let me sleep tonight
Why can't you just go away
What if I can't forget anything everything
What if I wait here what if I stand here waiting
I'm falling apart
You made me lay there hopelessly
I couldn't scream a word I couldn't push away
Are you disgusted with yourself
Why can't you just go away
What if I can't forget anything everything
What if I wait here what if I stand here waiting
You mother fucker I hope you burn in hell
I hope you know what you've caused me
You are the one that's ruined me
I was never one for violence
I could hold it in and just let go
A word could never destroy me
But you just pushed my limits
Everyone hates you
You're such a fucking failure
Parents look parents stare at you
You're family's a disaster
I feel my stomach turning
Everywhere I look they're staring at me
Eyes on my back it's eating me alive
The chills are racing up my neck
When you fall asleep tonight
The devils watching every move you make
Take your fucking words and just leave me alone
This is over take a step back now
The chills are racing up my neck
You can never antagonize me
I am bigger than this
I'll never leave
Every time I place my hand on her 
I can feel him moving 
I can hear his heart beating 
All the color comes back to his face 
Please keep breathing 
Keep your heart beating 
I keep on praying he's happy 
And every day's the same 
I keep praying he's happy 
Hold on tightly brother 
To keep your heart beating 
I'll keep your heart beating 
Let this be the day 
You finally realize you are all to blame 
This is your fault 
Let him live 
Ten years have past and there's nothing to show 
I've done my best to respect you 
Keep my head on the floor 
She'll never love you the way she could 
You'll never feel her warmth 
You'll never have our trust 
You'll never have it 
Words can't change a thing 
There's no denying it 
We can't just pretend that nothing happened 
Is this what you wanted 
Is this what you expected 
Hold on tightly brother 
To keep your heart beating 
Why can't I be dreaming 
I've got to be asleep 
Just tell me that I'm sleeping 
I pray I'm not awake
Something's off I can taste it now
Everything in the room keeps spinning
Please stop moving please stop standing there
My throat is getting so dry I'm freaking out
God help me I am losing my mind
I will never know my life
I will never sleep through the night
This is your mistake
Correct it and cut off
All this time I thought you hated me
And the demon between your legs
I will never give you the satisfaction
You'll never hear me screaming
Fuck you and these little games you play
You're wasted now you've thrown your life away
I can see you're getting slower every day
Your lungs are giving out
Your arms are slowing down
We both know this can't last forever
Things will change
Everything will change
I can't take another bite
I can't hold this down
You were the last thing I had to hold on to
Don't try and cover it up or justify this
Stagger your way out of our lives
You're just as worthless as he is
Your selfishness makes me sick
How can you live with yourself
What is wrong with you Where did you go
You really wanna go back to that
I heard you scream as he ripped you to pieces
Smashing your face on the table
I'm finding out
I never needed you to begin with
We don't need their charity
We don't need their apathy
Step aside
This is not your problem
This has nothing to do with you
We will never need you
We'll never need your help
Stay away from me
I don't need your help
All I wanted was to have my family back
To see my mothers smile
To hear my father say he loves me
One more time
Why does everything change
Why can't we go back to how things were before
I'll never take it for granted
I'll never fight for anything else
I will fight for this
I will fight for everything
So go ahead and shut us out again
Pray that someone takes your place
You are worthless
You better watch your fucking mouth
Before I rip it off your face
Right off your face
I saw you walk away
Right through the door
No goodbyes were said
No goodbyes were said to me
Leave the same way you came in
We won't be waiting here
Just start your engine
We've seen this act a million times
Don't think we don't know what you do
When you're on your own
Soak in the sex and greed
Enjoy this while you can
It's coming back
I saw you walk away
Right through the door
No goodbyes were said
No goodbyes were said to me
Leave the same way you came in
We won't be waiting here
We've seen this all a thousand times
It's time for you to stay away
We'll be just fine without you
Don't show your face again
We've been just fine without you
Don't show your face again
Just stay away
Who do you think you are
You're nothing to me 
There's nothing left to see
I'll tear the skin from your face 
I'll feel your bones crack 
Pray for yourself pray for forgiveness
I'm not the boy you used to know 
There's nothing stopping me 
Watch yourself I am not afraid 
Everything you love is gone Everything
There's no turning back
You know I'll never look back at you 
Everything you love everything you love is gone
Everything you love everything you love is gone
Everything you love is gone
A loving family with open arms and everything
I can see so clearly now
I can almost feel it right now
It's keeping me awake
Stuck in this empty room
Replaying everything in my head
I can almost feel it as much as I don't want to
I tried to show you the man that I could be
But now it's over it's time to let this be
I'm moving on with a new perspective
Leaving all the pieces of this
Broken home in my rear view mirror
It's time for me to start over
And every single chance I get
I say a prayer for you and your safety
Why God why have you abandoned me
Memories are all you'll ever have
I hope they stay with you forever and always
I hope they stay with you
I won't forget a thing take everything
Remember me
My heart is full
My bags are packed
I brought a picture 
To remember the fact
That the past is real 
And I can't change
I can't change
What's in front of me
reflections of a damned
by fiendish symptoms send
sarcastic roars of laughter
from far away it sounded
the rulers of eternal suppression
awaking from their hybernation
plundering and subjugation
bloodtrails gomorrah of the plains
no worthly penalty
never met their destiny
who'll take the part of catching hands
to get this scabby jacks
the rulers of eternal suppression
awaking from their hybernation
plundering and subjugation
bloodtrails gomorrah of the plains
reflections of a damned
by fiendish symptoms send
sarcastic roars of laughter
from far away it sounded
the rulers of eternal suppression
awaking from their hybernation
plundering and subjugation
bloodtrails gomorrah of the plains
hells breaking loose when the daltons rode
terrorizing aims get off the ground
fellowship by brotherhood in arms
despising law and order got remand
their soul has slept in cold eclipse
roused by fighting spirit
following the promised way straight
to the dawn of dying
dancing to the beat of the singing guns
another soul is passing by
at the dawn of dying
the dawn of dying
barrels sight their heads in coffeville
lured into the trap the end is near
at least the dead await the final storm
baptized in fire bodies to adorn
bullets flow dehumanized
but the purge is done
within the one who told the story
within the truth about the glory
of the dawn of dying
the dawn of dying
the final pulse of history
forever buried there where the others lie
old west infinity
perfect genocide is computerized
the laughing face of death around
the warning that nobody realized
will take us to the dawn
the dawn of dying
the dawn of dying
you pave the way for my robbing leech
there are no bounds and the souls are free
you'll stand in my path than you will see
all I need is just ten foot ground
and no emotion can stop the sound
evocation of everlasting brotherhood
I'm tired of your slanderous mockery
you're just a traitor without daredevilry
I have to face the man who wanna take my life
you know that I'm prepared for the fight
hey ho the final row
mournful fatal misery
hey ho the final row
with my gun and me
all I need is just ten foot ground
and no emotion can stop the sound
evacation of everlasting brotherhood
you see the tension in my staring eyes
look at my hand that's leap and strike
don't wait to long and stop to breathe
cause heaven awaits that somebody decease
all I need is just ten foot ground
and no emotion can stop the sound
evocation of everlasting brotherhood
hey ho the final row
mournful fatal misery
hey ho the final row
with my gun and me
we took a little trip just you and me
the lead that put us out of misery
no one will ever hold us in contempt
decision between the quick and the dead
praying to the wretched beasts
maybe they can forgive
the warriors of haunted souls
and common mavericks
sorrows of their inner lifes
hope burned down in flames
a king would trade his finest crown
to get out of their way
hearts will break a thousand times
not even just in dreams
guns will wait a thousand nights
gone with the wind
gone with the wind
dying with their boots on
the shadows of the proud
still sounding in their ears
the mating call of gold
places of immortality
millions sacred tombs
no medicine will ever heal
that never healing wounds
hearts will break a thousand times
not even just in dreams
guns will wait a thousand nights
gone with the wind
gone with the wind
upon a land where glory lies
the might of suns and moons
eternally under the sky
covered by the truth
when gods would lay their weapons down
and no more war to fight
you'll see em at the long horizon
finally unite
gone with the wind
gone with the wind
a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
pursued like a wounded deer
branded inhumanity
crime controlled
wild instinct to stay alive
the morning that will never die
fire down below
deep in my mind
can't be denied
out of sight
like a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
like a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
when they set my skin on fire
last resort desire
I can't resist
the man they couldn't catch
is the man they couldn't hang
they'll spiteful kissed
balanced on the edge
inseminated death
skeletons left behind
by a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
by a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
blessed by the gods
which path will he take
visions of freedom
that never awake
they don't shoot him down
and they don't hang him up
but the rattlesnake's bite
and the sun burning black
a rattlesnake shake
An old cowboy went out on a dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh
Ghost riders in the sky
Their brands were still on fire
and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shining
and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him
as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
and he heard their mournful cry
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh
Ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that head
but they ain't caught them yet
'cause they've got to ride forever
on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting as they ride
and hear their awful cry
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh
Ghost riders in the sky
As the riders loped on by him
he heard one calls his name
If you want to save your soul
from hell riding on your range
Then cowboy change your ways today
or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd
across these endless skies
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh
Ghost riders in the sky
riding the devil's horse
I'm riding the devil's horse
the sinister curse has me in it's spell
degraded scalps that adorn me so well
and every time when your death glare meets mine
a phantom is gazing through cynical eyes
bounded so faithful by spiritual beasts
scattering splendors of worshipping deeds
no mercy will pump out the damned tears in me
predominant signs bring just tragedy
to the perdition  that keeps me alive
riding the devil's horse
I'm riding the devil's horse
the devil's horse
it whispers to me with languishing lips
the evil is hunger and the fire I breathe
I know that there're two ways for me to walk on
within my rage under final command
and power was given to me by the sword
the day of my wrath who'll be able to stand
nobody surviving the passage of blood
and hell follows me when I'm rising up
so follow my trace  to the destiny
riding the devil's horse
I'm riding the devil's horse
the devil's horse
I dreamt I was in heaven
among the angel's gold
feeded by a pleasant hand
that dealt the playing cards
no sorts of bones whatever
creeping on the ground
'cause bonds of faith may always sever
but my gun is still around
now I just found a game
like a mortal upper story
play the final showdown scene
'til you are gone to glory
both friends and foes agree
accused of breaking laws
there is no money in this secret box
the fodder to my purse
maybe I am wrong
maybe I am right
maybe I'm not strong enough
maybe I will die
like a tawny snake
in a torrid clime
the twilight
'til the dawn of time
maybe I disclaim my honour
maybe I will jumping down the running train 
jumping down the running train
 jumping down the running train
the ballade of Jesse James
there was a little lady
she was twined in golden hair
don't want to take her to my heart
'cause dollars doesn't smell
she felt down on her knees
I cant forget the sound
'cause bonds of faith may always sever
but my gun is still around
from the deepground of the ocean
to the top of mountains high
where love threw up the sponge
fear got the upper hand
an insidious bullet from behind
the coffin let me learn
there's no money in this secret box
just fodder to the worms
maybe
threatening predominant thunder growls
sending felonious packs of hounds
dust covered the peace from bad to the worse
the silly red breed was about to burst
a place where the angels got prostitudes
and gods are precursors of breaking rules
casting a gloom over those who believe
denaturalized in a sea full of blood
no security to find in this crimson mud
dishonouered town too tough to die
like a leaf that is caught in the endless tide
a place where the angels got prostitudes
and gods are precursors of breaking rules
casting a gloom over those who believe
nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide
sing the song
you better keep inside
with loaded guns
on holy ground
like a deadly punch
desperados in town
nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide
don't try to be strong
don't even try to fight
for when we'll be gone
you might still be around
and you sing this song
'cause desperados in town
showdown has come
with deadly sound
it's a quick draw game
desperados in town
nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide
searching for a lucky game
or been thirsty by the way
come on boys and listen to me
don't pray the god that you should see
a place where all the honest men
the desert mice the desert rats 
wholesome honey stay alive
if you are dry step in and try
we'll take you to the valley's green
you'll hear the distant fairy sing
pretty maids bear up your pall
walk in and find your chance for sale
forget the plagues within your life
in this hive we're all alive
right down the freemont street you'll find
the loyal and the proud unite
enjoy before you leave the town
and don't forget to turn around
make your path straight to the moon
oriental saloon
rattle your spurs and swing your legs
dancing to the girls request
come on fellow fill up your glass
to the health of our glorious class
see the splendid flowers grow
before the rain begins to fall
even whiskey to your mind
best that you will ever find
we'll take you to the valley's green
you'll hear the distant fairy sing
pretty maids bear up your pall
walk in and find your chance for sale
forget the plagues within your life
in this hive we're all alive
right down the freemont street you'll find
the loyal and the proud unite
enjoy before you leave the town
and don't forget to turn around
make your path straight to the moon
oriental saloon
the scrapping of the drunken boys
exuberance ain't got no choice
are sinners now senseless grown
night careers they start to flow
the whipping of the willing whores
your soul can really wish no more
for noble hearts and blushing wimps
the outlaw rock'n'roll begins
we'll take you to the valley's green
you'll hear the distant fairy sing
pretty maids bear up your pall
walk in and find your chance for sale
forget the plagues within your life
in this hive we're all alive
right down the freemont street you'll find
the loyal and the proud unite
enjoy before you leave the town
and don't forget to turn around
make your path straight to the moon
oriental saloon
Child of atrocity  Progeny of Hel
Son of maiden fell
Bound in dwarven chain
Helpless roar in rage
Time for stars to fall
Ragnark's inaugural call
Odin holds the prophecy scroll
Release the beast
Fimbul winter comes
Fires dying fast
Wolfsong rides the gale
Frost whips with hail
Release the beast
Gluten maws in bloody feast
Horned trolls and mystical folk
Within the deep woods of twilight
Ethereal misty fingers entwine
Crooked boughs and mossy roots
Smell of the rain soaked ground
Yet hark What be this sound
Coming from afar
Haunting tunes the fairy song
They join in rings to dance
Plucking fiddles hewn of oak
Dwell in a citadel of fog
Horned trolls and mystical folk
These horned trolls and mystical folk
They dwell in the brooks
The dwell on the trees
They live under rock
They live by the sea
Astride frogs and dragon flies
The travel far and wide
Mortal dreamers they invite
To their realm of ever light
Perchance in thy strangest dremas
You glimpse fairies soynd asleep
There by the creek
Yet deeper still
They join in rings to dance
Plucking fiddles hewn of oak
Dwell in a citadel of fog
Horned trolls and mystical folk
These horned trolls and mystical folk
They dwell in the brooks
The dwell on the trees
They live under rock
They live by the sea
Great God of the storm Ruler of the skies above
Mighty everwarrior Thor
Thy name we call
Descend to Midgard
Great God of the gloom
We summon you
Rhyming with thunder chanter the holy Galder
Modi Thruder Magni  Thor
Master of the tempest lord of wintry call
Modi Thruder Magni  He is Thor one and all
Swing thy holy hammer
Warriors revel in the sight
With swords upraised
To hail the pouring rain
I greet thee chariot rider
Frost giants bane
Never fall always uphold this battle hymn of old
Mortal kinsmen die
As crops wither and subside
Wealth is passing by
Yet eternal remains a glorious deed's name
A legacy of honor legend for tomorrow
For what glory warriors await
Once their heyday goes under
Save a skald's praise rhyming with thunder
Swing thy holy hammer
Warriors revel in the sight
With swords upraised
To hail the pouring rain
I greet thee chariot rider
Frost giants bane
Never fall always uphold this battle hymn of old
Rhyming with thunder chanter the holy Galder
Modi Thruder Magni  Thor
Master of the tempest lord of wintry call
Modi Thruder Magni  He is Thor one and all
Spirit of the ash tree
Dweller in the oak Thy realm I wish to traverse
I whisper the ancient verse
Whisper the ancient verse
Passage safe to earn
Gods of the earth
You who made sylvan breath
Hear now my spells
Hear now my spells
As I flirt nightshade
In pagan forests primeval
Where dusk enthroned is king
Once upon a day
On the wings of fairytale Shamanic paths I take
Where in adoration
Wolves to the moon bay
To the moon bay
Another figure I bcome
Inside the sylvan canvass
Hidden away far from your world
I have ridden
Spireless lands await me
In a world of elder magecraft
Elven runes engraved
Upon hyperborean skies
Like stars arrayed
The man in black
There he awaits
And there's no coming back
Forest calling to mine ear
Distand echoes of the Dryad
Enthralled I stand by this woodland melody
Upon the altar of yew
Before Fangorn's palace
The Elven heart is beating
Rhythm of my breathing
My hands lie bleeding
Dagger bitten grimly
An offering of life
To ethereal folk I sing
An eerie moon beckons me
Gnarled boughs whistle
Attuned to a magic wind
Call of elder arts I hearken
Rings of stones Idols of crows
Whilst primordial wonders stir the air
Trees lively welcome me
In this mystical realm
Of eldritch sorcery and Faery runes
Faery runes
And Io do I see my father
And Io do I see my mother
And my sisters and my brothers
And the line of my people
Back to the beginning
And Io they do call me
In the halls of Valhalla
Where the brave may live forever
From death's embrace I awaken
Clutching the sword my life had taken
Roofs thatched with gold
Songs of warriors old
In Odin's court
My eyes behold splendor untold
What be this place
What maiden brought my sould herein
These are the halls
Of glorious Valhalla
Step forth ye hammerheart
Blessed champion of the Gods
Heimdall will guard it
Vidar will welcome
In Odin's court our Einherjer brethren
Come o beloved of the Raven
Feast on flesh and mead
Forever and all time
'Till Ragnarok arrives
These are the halls
Of mighty Valhalla
Heimdall will guard it
Vidar will welcome
In Odin's court
In Odin's court
I return to the ancient tree
What was shall forever be
Every nche resounds eternally
Warlike triumphant song
There in Odin's court
Hammers of thunder temper a storm
Wailing the wonds descend from the North
Dragons awaken in their sanctums of frost
Three hundred berserkers strong
Sail a' Viking ere the break of dawn
Plunder in the East
Raze village  burn monasteries
Wicked thralls of this pale Christ
In our heart we know no fear
In our eyes swells no tear
Should death we meet today
Let it be so
Crowned in glory we shall fall
Storm Ravens sweep me away
Howl blood to the wintry sway
In Valhalla for me Odin shall await
Call beyond the nigthly sky
The brave who lost their lives
Howl blood to the wintry sway
In Valhalla for me Odin shall await
Feel the rage of the Aesir and die
Storm Ravens come
With swords blessed by the Gods
Raging and furious
In battle they stand victorious
Twin ravens soaring high
Feel the rage of Aesir and die
Storm Ravens come
En sommarnatt
Varmen ligger tat
Sover och latt bedovar
Men Harald han
Sover inte sott
Nagot hans somn berovar
Flickan brevid
Hon var natt och grann
Fager som manens strimma
Harald nervos
Vagar inte be
Om dansen i nattens timma
Dansen i nattens timma
Men nar solen tittar fram
Han langsamt stracker ut sin hand
Och tar henne itu sin famn
Att dansa i gryningens timma
Nar ljuset lyfter nattens fang
Och snarjer den med grybubssang
Han bju'r henne pa en svangom
Att dansa i gryningens timma
Att dansa i gryningens timma
Natten var mork
Men ar snart forbi
Gryningen ar pa ingang
Den lockar trollskt
Med farglekar i skyn
Att bjuda upp till solsang
Harald bestamt
Reser sig upp
Tar modet sitt till fanga
Tar ett andetag
Tanker tillbaks
Pa ensamma natter langa
Ensamma natter langa
In the realm of the Tuatha De Danann
My delight was the sound of the hammer and forge
Shaping bronze into weapons of war
Strong was Cuchulain and shining was Lugh
Hymns of Gaelic valor
And the emblems of Rome hid the sky
And the sons of the Goddes Danann
Strong like Cuchulain and shining like Lugh
Die for Gaelic valor
O'er the realm of the Tuatha de Danann
And the anvils resounding no more
Cuchulain forgotten  forgotten is Lugh
For the lost Gaelic valor
How bovine is all the mud I have to choke down
The wounds of these parasites
The mankind is no longer destiny's child
As manic and possessed by fraud
The grotesque of paradox thinking
You feed the wold with earthlings as you are
I mourning and can barely feel me
You eat souls which also can feel
So your own
From where my hate comes ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ you asking
It's because I love so many things
Who ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ when they look into my eyes
Then they know they are there
On head you're wearing the roots
And wonder why you can't stand in your mire
Oh ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ what a wonderful meal I smell
I want to touch it
Is it what it seems to be
Oh ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ how I have longed for it
I have to taste it
Crawl deep into my throat
The force of the invincible was dried up
As we begun to made our clothes
From the skin of our children
Our greatness shadows have all marked lines
They are diverse
Unmistakable signs
Ideas of victory
All golden shots
A stone hierarchy which is drenched in blood
The flesh becomes machine
Life is resource
Our ruin silhouettes
The truncated mass gets scum as food
The sunset promises the slaves no good
The deeds leave traces and stinking wounds
Seed thrives above the head
Not on the ground
The fat cats masturbate their spitting dicks
Life became a machine
A selfkilling force
Our ruin silhouettes
Total war is already available
As a vaccination
But the poetry of suggestion
Has its beginning by far not only
On the right edge of the sheet
How many paradise are still promised you
The lowest instinct burns confidence
He leveled it
Since the beginning of time
Impotence will entice the brainless
To recurrent missteps
As long as the leader shows the way
The harvest will be a crop failure
The temples do not serve the people
They are monuments of coordination
But with the help of the word it heals itself
The clocks run backwards
To stop this world mean to do the same
The sacrifice of life as defense of honor
Just soulless tools they are
Since eons this scourge grows
A constantly recurring phenomenon  like a cycle
Is that what you call normal
I refused this idea
All in me upends
Sometimes somehow helpless
But I will not loose my focus  never give up
Mother of our earth  where are you
Let knowledge shine in these eyes
I can't accept that this should be the truth
It tears me into thousands of pieces
We stand alone  euphoria's end next to us
Is all hope gone  the signs are not the hoped
Not a step we draw back
This will not be our fight's end
You will end here  your own beast
You can't withstand
Nothing but ash should cover
The path of this boil
Freedom  arise and turn the blind to dust
Grow up in new hope and stand here
Your euphoria should end in doubt
It's a matter of the approach
But pestilence tentacles are long
It will be a tough fight
The ravens will be the first of our vanguard
Eyes of the wisdom
If the croaking sounds we are already done
This triumph will be ours
Your dream of the lost paradise
Will end if you asleep
The farewell reveals all your secrecies
You're damned to a silent demise
The seemingly secure upper hand
Will be cut off to you
The rest of you can not touch her again
Indifference will be your final destiny
The end is already been sealed
The ravens will be the first of our vanguard
Eyes of the wisdom
If the croaking sounds we are already done
This triumph will be ours
I spit my hatred
On your feet and you conscience
Overeaten  I am sick off
Always docile  conformist clones
Tripper of suggestive words
Reviewers of the gluttony
Appraiser of banalities
Beneficiaries and sycophants
All you silent smug greedy hypocrites
Unresisting slick obscuring of the truth
You betrayers
You feast upon the misery of innocence
Such a wretched lying
The perversion purest form
Overcrowded throats  bloated trivialities
Stupidity is chosen as the glorious
Your whining should never happen to a grace
Colored our thoughts in blood red
With bleary but burning eyes
The blast of a repressed ego becomes a curse
The guard is now a threat
In our children's world
A completely torn and drowned heart of a broken
Made of a stone
Uncontrolled and like a rabid dog
A veil of contempt covered his own stop
Calm and cold  without sun
The kindness is gone
We fell down  still do it
Blank and out of you hands
The belief in your strength  we lose him
Still do it
The cradle helpless but longing peek
There was surrender but no escape
All hope disordered
The love was slaughtered
Emotions murdered
And it does still hurt
The shadows of our lives banalities
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂOld  a fragile despot
His own world god
We felt abandoned  still do it
Blank and out of his hands
The belief in his strength remains
Closed to us forever
I'm climbing up the monument
Everlasting  disgusting  frustrating
All hating
Disturbing  reflecting and damning
Monument
I'm passing our success  so glorious
The haughtiness
Grimaces of races  creations of nations
The stations of insane
The summit  I can't reach him
He's growing
They cheat  they bleed  they puke
And they spit
Too bold  too hard to understand
I give a fuck
Their presumption over the others
The planets collide in the sky
The old ones command by a curse or by hand
That we've come to the end of our times
Thoughts paralysed a red tide will rise
Dystopia seen through cephalopod eyes
Creatures reborn from weird tales untold
Gods are descending a force unrelenting
Cthulhu will rise from the sea
Turning blood sea and awaking the dead
>From their aeons of suffering sleep
Monoliths rise to fiery skies
Empires dead in the shadow of flies
Serpent unwind to torture and bind
No one survives the ultimate fall of mankind
Atlantis will rise
The kraken alive
These are fortean times
No sanctuary no hail mary
No visionarycan save you from what has begun
Infidels fall to their knees and they start
Searing white light from the guardians flesh
Azrael rising wings of the angel of death
No sanctuary no hail mary
No visionarycan save you from what has begun
This is leviathan
Death of the sun
Age of darkness has won
How many chances do I get to find redemption
When I've been low so many times
But I've paid for all my crimes
Well I know I've done the wrong things
But I wanna tell you one thing
Cos' you've got to stand for something
Or you're gonna fall for nothing
And I'm not afraid to die
But I refused to lose my mind
My only master is the man I see in the mirror
He's done me more harm than he knows
But it's the place that I call home
Set sail on the good ship levitation
Eyes wired shut with fascination
Cold blooded silence in the vacuum
Astronauts dining in the backroom
Words go unspoken and deeds go undone
The mark of the devil engraved on the sun
Freaks and fanatics all losing their mind
Further to the east for liberation
Falling in line for medication
Drug addled comfort in the vacuum
Dinosaurs choking in the bathroom
Saturn is calling its children back home
The eyes of medusa have turned them to stone
Predators wait for the breathing to stop
Clinging to life til the very last drop
Coursing through veins as it cuts to the bone
Talking to someone but I'm all alone
Weight of the world has me pinned to the floor
The doctor don't mind so he's giving me more
Ghosts come and go but they don't know my name
Something is different yet always the same
Brain cannot function and hands cannot feel
State of a mind at large nothing is real
Nothing is real 
You line 'em up and we'll knock 'em down
You hit the lights and we'll hit the town
You're on the dole we're on the lam
Born free to ride we don't give a damn
You live by the law but we live for sin
We fight the war but we'll never win
We're born to lose but baby that's alright
We'll keep on ridin' through the night
Back down the open road
The only road we've ever known
Step aside cos' we're coming through
We are the filthy and the few
We're hot as hell and you're a stone cold queen
You see our faces on your TV screen
We got no money we got no friends
We'll keep on the ridin' til the livin' end
Scenic atrocities on a technicolour breeze
The sun will burn the planets turn
And I'm always going to be here
The ship of dreams ain't what it seems
So i'm always going to be here
Another ride I may have died
But I'm always going to be here
One they call the saviour but nobody's saving me
This is an ode to my condition
I owe it all to my affliction
Prayers go unanswered and I turn from the sun
Demons lead me Into oblivion
Oh won't you save me from myself
Come on and save me from myself
Oh won't you save me from myself
Come on and save me from myself
A nameless horror eye for an eye
Malefic demons here comes the night
This witching hour these sacred shores
These shadows cast into the depths for ever more
A mist is stirring the moon is full
Lock all your windows turn off all the lights
A rotting horror creeping slowly with the tide
It's gonna hunt you like a pack of hungry dogs
No way to stop is it's coming in the fog
I don't believe in fortune best of luck or bad
I don't believe in witches deities or gods
There's something in the fog 
A warning sign
Leave earth behind
Into the stars
Return to mars
This astral tomb
Mankind is doomed
Funeral of stars
Return to mars
Lights out silver in the darkness
Shadows of aquarius
Fading with the dawn
Freedom banished from utopia
Exiled to hysteria
A new age is born
Night follows day as life flitters away
On the quest for the ultimate high
Ride for tomorrow we beg steal borrow
To be where the earth meets the skies
Vengeance religion of the outlaw
The honour that you die for
The clearing of the mist
Martys the children and the stardust
Become one with the universe
The order of the fist
Carry the burden for chaos and order
The blame always laid at your doom
You reap what you sow it's the outlaw you know
When you've chosen to live by the sword
Scar them brand them as the outcast
Hound them hound them ever after
No gods and no masters no duties no shame
Lights out silver in the darkness
Shadows of aquarius fading with the dawn
Freedom banished from utopia
Exiled to hysteria a new age is born
Vengeance religion of the outlaw
Martys the children and the stardust
Scar them brand them as the outcast
Hound them hound them ever after
No gods and no masters no duties no shame
Full moon brooding over the earth
Empty prayer now for what it's worth
Band of liars all got something to hide
Heading north all under the eye
Skin crawling at the sight of the moon
Blood frozen by the reading of ruines
Paranoia starts to eat at your brain
Unholy curse to drive you into the grave
Atone for all your sins now
Wash away all the pain
Make your peace with god now
Before you go insane
Execration on the heads of the nine
Cruel dementia starts to prey on their minds
A plague upon them for the wrong they have done
A malediction in the light of the sun
Leave the city under cover of night
A guilty conscience and a fear of the bite
Savage visions in the dark of the trees
Hear the howling of the wolf on the breeze
Invocation of a suicide pact
Book of tongues decreed there's no going back
Turn to fire for the ashes you crave
Bishops wolf has led the nine to the grave
Beggars thieves and lifes downtrodden
Come to me as the king of the damned
They hang their actions on my blackened outlook
They take their lives by the slight of my hand
They bought a ticket to the gates of heaven
But all the saints see them coming and they run
No chance for reason
No hope at all
As sorry sign of weakness
A silly game to play
Dead eyes to find you
No tales to tell
Old hands are broken
Old veins are torn
We're trying we're torn
We're all dying from the day that we are born
We're trying we're torn
Sitting at the gates in the middle of the night
Scheming 'neath the moon
Casting wicked spells
Punish hearts so dark
Drag them into hell
Breathed its rancid stench
Reject humanity
Summon dead's return
Each day waits for
Zombies seeking out the flesh of humans
Zombies ripping up the flesh
Abandoned the world a cemetery home
Solitude so pure yet cold and so alone
Merlin weeps
Bastardized by the flesh
Captive souls cannot transcend
The supremacy of instinct
Wallow in putridity
The infinite stretch of the mind
An essence encased in dust
Cannot sever but we must
This flesh is ridiculous
Carnality eviscerates
Plagues the soul with waste
This flesh is ridiculous
In 1666 cobwebs lace the cluttered graveyard
Decaying tombs of scattered dead
Plaguing landscapes within the gates
Filled with corpses once reanimated
Back to life brought back to life
Reanimated
And Merlin sayeth
Get the fuck up you crazy corpse
Dripping from a solar flare
Molten time lubricates existence
Clouds of neurons
Dendrites impregnate the earth
Flesh is spawned
Decrepit art of mutilation
A cyclic universe
Empties its bowels
Beyond endless seas of time
Lost in translation of being
The continuum weaves
With tentacles so pure
A wretched rebirth
Cloaked in pain
Limbs contorted with grotesque symmetry
Spiraling to their final form
Amidst eternity fertility manifest
Putrid rebirth
Tonight it will rain blood
Like snow falling from mountain tops
Tonight it will rain death
Fire rising up from hell
Nothing left
This is the end of time
Disintegrate into obscurity
Universe deceaseHATE  Forever our motive
Feelings driven by rage
KILL  Is our intention
Steel caps marching from Hades
Trial by Power
Trial by Power
WARFARE  Pain and destruction
Rape pillage and butcher
CARNAGE  Is our true motive
Tightening our grip on this world
CHAOS  A whirlwind barbaric
Devour the world to its core
SIN  We are sinners
Sinners WILL conquer this world
STRIKE  Delivered with full force
No mercy an eye for an eye
CONQUER  The path of triumph
A scorching wrath from hell
Contorted face of deceit bound and forsaken
Fearful tales from a soul
Tempted in slumber
A puppet dancing to tunes
Nightmares bring them to wake
But the verdict draws near
Hear the cry
DEATH SENTENCE
DEATH DEATH
DEATH SENTENCE
The winter storm gleams of ice
It shatters the mind of man
Bound by the hands of fate never to forgive
Never to relinquish
Hear the cry
DEATH SENTENCE
DEATH DEATH
YOUR DEATH SENTENCE
THRASH
Nothing remains
Nothing NOTHING REMAINS
Dark visions still haunting
Spirits soon appear
Watching and waiting
Terror draws near
Protected by reality no more
Bow down to your master
Dark powers to weave a common goal
Hard as steel hard as the ground you stand
What was rotten and now corrupt
Shall be stripped torn asunder
A bloodied ravaged cloth
The remnants of betrayal
A mixture of innocence and wickedness
A piercing glare
A tale of another time
RETRIBUTION 
The torments of sleep a battle of one's will
Who fails who The Achilles shield
With or without the hammer of damnation
Bearers of life or death
Onwards reap destruction
Onwards come on
Onwards reap destruction
Onwards OBLITERATION
Fearless age what's to gain no after thought
Choice is yours don't repent
Tainted lies tethered cloak what's to become
I say this the choice is yours
We the bearers the axis of our time
Life's voracious
Life's a curse
Life's a test of one's strength
Life's voracious
Life's a curse
Take the oath pledge till death
BLOOD AND IRON
Rip the curse from the womb
BLOOD AND IRON
Destined at birth
Resting fire raven's throng
Path oh so clear
A path I so belong
Lightning rips shadows move
Hail the endless sky
Our endless song
Alright motherfuckers march or DIE
Insidious malicious
Draw your sword in troubled times
Honour pride
Believe from within
An age from beyond
Sons of valor consume your fate
I am your blade condensed in rage
My forthright bloodied fist
Spellbound salute my realm
I'll strike with hate enrage the curse
I'll toast a praise blood for blood
My hallowed turf is bathed in sweat
Tears and shallow graves
Once mighty here they came to maim
Reverence the highest claim
Enter the realm
The realm of the damned
Enter the realm
The realm of the damned
The realm of the damned
Face the west at sunset
Hear the bugle's call
The spirit of the ANZAC code
Will live on in us all
At the dawn of each new day
Turn and face the east
Hail for those who died
Remember the deceased
No room to raise their rifles
Clamouring over sun stench corpses
In dark conditions they fought hard
With sword and fist
Prepare to charge
Fix bayonets
Clear your thoughts
No bullets
This is hand to hand combat
All hail the legends of Lone Pine
The fighting raged relentlessly
Before the week was done
6000 more lay dead out in the sun
Blood spilt in the ridges
In the gullies in the trench
Stretcher man moved the wounded back
Out of the stench
They fought hard with sword and bloodied fist 
The awareness the drive of the mind
Possessed and self driven
A silence benign
Ride the winds of fate
A burning deliverance
It's never too late
The hands of the maker
The hands of the true
What pleasures I feel a thunderous image of doom
Ripped to pieces
An image sold through time
It's a fight it's a fight
But we are the first ones in line
Come on taste blood
Lost in your mind nothing in sight
Preparing to enter your grave
Torn between the goddess of fate
The objectives which you had laid
Body and mind at ease
Men and women cry
This is the fate of one man's choice
To conquer or be slayed
Choose your death
Looking down on the empire's ruin
To the land of no turning back
The howling wind carries the voice of pain
Shattering the midnight sky
Strength through fear
The reaper's blade
Strength through fear
The martyr's call a hero's grave
Strength through fear
The reaper's blade
Strength through fear
The martyr's call a hero's grave
Persecuted since his death
Lie on fucking lie
His portrait hangs in the gates of honour
An aura so widely admired
White boy why you wanna say sup
Why you braggin' like you bust shit up
Jump jump jump around 
Shake  that booty get down
White dude's can't jump or dance
Now what the hell is that all about
Here's a big boot to your ass hanging out
So you think you're a gangsta
More like a white suburban pranksta
Tagging up the walls hanging with the homies
Now you think you're a hoodie
You saw Colors and you got a woody
Then thought up the master plan
I remember when phat was spelled with an F
I remember if you couldn't hear you were deaf
I remember when you were where you were from
And not what you saw on the television son
wigga wigga  white boy
wigga wigga  gangsta wannabe

pull your hood up  pull your hood up
I remember when
As I enter the room it gets silent
my identity by itself causes violence
it must be the rebel in me
walking a line that's plain enough to see
don't step up  step off
cause my deadly bite will rip your head off
why even sweat never let it bother
I inherited Pride from my Father
who I am is what I choose
and that't the way it is
it's who I am it's how I live
the rebel you love to hate
The rhythm the rebel the music will level
hitting you hard like a ten ton shovel
I got pounds so understand
I got pounds and the Master Plan
taking out punks with the back of my hand
making a point and taking a stand
like 2Pac you're gonna get popped
don't care what you think  cause I wear the ring
don't care what you think  not a damn thing
don't care what you think  my shit don't stink
the rebel you love to hate
hardcore  hard to the core
the rhythm of the rebel makes you want more
so listen to the sound of the underground
criticize our country  kick us when we're down
criticize our military movements on the ground
you wanna be a martyr  we're happy to oblige
you wanna be a victim of a system that divides
you wanna be a hero  then we gonna collide
you wanna go to paradise  we'll pay for the ride
say we are the terrorists  that we are to blame
we brought it to ourselves  so you fuckin say
scream about atrocities
since it pains you so much to watch their fate
makin' friends is fun
criticize  our country
complain about our country  as coalitions build
scream  about atrocities
scream about humanity  America's insanity
since it pains you so much to watch their fate
why don't you pack your bags and leave
making friends is FUN 
neofascist fashion queens prepare for techno war
DJs spin a lethal mix hypnotizing neon lights
wearing proud the Iron Cross
dance around like Devo  
when they come to shine

Ramm  de men of Stein
you must know your enemy
destroy all the nonbelievers
drive them down onto their knees
ein  two  tres  GO
dance around like devo 
techno rules the world tonight
dance around like devo
Living in a country where freedom is provided
Blame society and the generations past
Hyping out everyone to fight for your cause
Blaming everyone for indians that fell
Rage  against  the mac machine
Cashing in  sellout hypocrites
Corporation dollars fund your benefits
As they press up all your records
And buy your krock hits
You fucking hypocrites
Fuck you fuck Tibet fuck your fans
Move there if you feel so sad
Raise alot of cash and ship it to Tibet
You hypocrites did you forget
There's people starving in our own backyards
A westcoast liberal douchebag dickhead
Millionaire's perspective
Rage  against  
Freedom  isn't free
Freedom  isn't free
Why do you rage against freedom
Rage  against  
Someone called for the doctor

I'm an extra  on Star Trex
It's my break  on TV
The fourth man in the landing crew
It's the last you'll see of me
They didn't ask me I wanted to go
And if they did  I would have told them NO
I'm an extra
Just stay up at the helm and help Sulu steer
I'm an extraDeath is not the answer
We're in this together
It's dragging us down
It's pulling us apart
Don't be scared to set your soul on fire
If we fall we'll rise
We'll rise again
And if we fall we will rise again
You'll always end up the same
If you're not listening
Disappear from the floor to ceiling
Realize that I'm not gone just yet
Disappear from the floor to ceiling
He said he's not ready to die just yet
Now I stand looking up again
After years of silence
Pushing on and falling back
Swimming in a pool of blood
On my way to hell
Through an endless sea of stars
It was cold and still
Drag me down pull me apart
Every time you feel alone
It's not the end of the world
Every time you feel alone
Just know I'm there
You'll always end up the same
If you're not listening
Now I stand looking up again
After years of silence
Pushing on and falling back
Swimming in a pool of blood
On my way to hell
Through an endless sea of stars
It was cold and still
Drag me down pull me apart
Voices for the voiceless
Together we can change tomorrow
We are fighting for the answers
Don't hide between the shadows
We are the voices for the voiceless
Understanding leads to progress
Wake up and see what's in front of your eyes
Express what you feel and come alive
This is a story of you living the truth
Only life itself is bigger than you
We are the voices for the voiceless
Together we can stop this silence
I want what I shouldn't
I tried but I couldn't
It's OK to feel like no one
Knows your name
They say
Spend time for your riches
There's no rest for the wicked
But that's what the evil say
It's all just a game
We're killing all our heroes
They've been hiding in the shadows
We are the voices for the voiceless
Don't be afraid we're making progress
Wake up and see what's in front of your eyes
Express what you feel and come alive
We don't know who we are
Until we shed our skin
No more fears
No more lies
Just strong within
I want what I shouldn't
I tried but I couldn't
It's OK to feel like no one
Knows your name
They say
Spend time for your riches
There's no rest for the wicked
But that's what the evil say
It's all just a game
When I thought that I was dead
It was all inside my head
Only hope brings a new light
We are the voices for the voiceless
Well Ive been running from this story for years
The ghost keeps chasing me
The grounds keep breaking me
Im not really lost I just havent found it yet
Let me just say let me escape
I know I can
I know I can 
Ive been alone Ive been so scared
I know youre there
I know youre there 
They said
Breathe in just a little more 
They said
Breathe in just a little more 
They said breathe in just a little more
This has to stop
It cant go on like this
Just get me out of this sinking ship Im in
Let me just say let me escape
I know I can
I know I can 
Ive been alone Ive been so scared
I know youre there
I know youre there 
Its only pain when it hurts
Its only night when its black
The only thing youll love is lost
And the light pulls you back
It seems like this road
It doesn't go anywhere
It doesn't stop
But still we have to pretend
It's okay when your heart stops
Swallow it will feel the same
Like everybody else does
Don't cry just numb the pain
Don't try to hide the pain
Cause it won't stop until your heart drops out
Don't think twice just chase the sound
No it wont stop till your heart gives out
Don't lose yourself to the crowd of here and now
We're addicted to this thing
They call medicine
It won't beat your fears nor hide your tears
We're addicted to this thing
They call medicine
It won't beat your fears nor hide your tears
Cause it won't stop until your heart drops out
Don't think twice just chase the sound
No it wont stop till your heart gives out
Don't lose yourself to the crowd of here and now
How can you think
We're blind enough
That with broken spines
We get ourselves back up
You separate the good from the bad
The poor from the rich and born from the dead
We get ourselves back up
We get ourselves back up back up
As its passing by
All the time
It's a constant climb
As we forget the things we know
So where do we all go this time
You said that I could rest awhile
Did I get the feeling wrong
All we do is wait in line
You were on your own
The streetlights on again
I walk without a name
Strangely beloved yet unrequited
Do you feel like you missed it
There's safety in your eyes
To walk without disguise
I was wrong and you were right
There's no need to lie
Your giving it away this time
How could you ignore your mind
When you were on your own
You were on your own
Your giving it away this time
How could you ignore your mind
When you were on your own
You were on your own
If you're careful with my heart
Everybody gets lost somehow
It's where we were meant to start
Now I was right and you were wrong
Every single night I sleep alone
You see some men can't face defeat
Some let it leak into their bones
But not me
I'm not scared of the things that I love
I'm giving it away this time
How could you ignore your mind
When you were on your own
You were on your own
Don't throw it all away this time
Only just to lose you're mind
When you were on your own
When you were on your own
When you were on your own
Waking up again in this fragile state we're in
Trying to understand what makes you a better man
Feel the raw emotion
This is who you're meant to be
They can see above our heads
They can see across this wasteland
On my knees I beg to leave every day
So sick of the air we breathe
If we compare the scars through our eyes
Close up yours are just as bad as mine
But we know yeah we know we are innocent
Innocent criminals
We're on the edge
We're under attack
If this goes on we can only go back
We're on the edge
We're under attack
If this goes on then we both fade to black
We want to lead you and oversee you
We've been waiting here for you
All that's left is your conscious
Everything you tried to drown
We're coming closer we're coming closer
Hold me nearer hold me nearer
If you say you really mean it
Then I want to be everything that you say
Everything that you say
From the ashes of our past
Wisdom shall grow
If we see the light I won't pray for the unknown
When everything is changing
When love is the only thing we need
We shouldn't have to feel alone
We shouldn't have to feel alone
If we loved ourselves we
If we loved ourselves we
We would love each other more
We would love each other more
If we loved ourselves we
We would love each other more
Hidden hands drawing you in
All created by a nameless king
In peace together as on
We walk towards the open sun
What happened to the joy we shared
I know that nothing is permanent
I miss the truth
I miss the feel and I miss us being real
The words in my mouth set the screen
No you don't understand me
It keeps me alive
Tell me the truth
Don't tell me a lie
Just know that this is real
How are we going to find out
Who we are and what we love
Are you connected to your heart
Are you connected to yourself
Just know that this is real
Hey listen up
I'm talking to you
You've got some fucking nerve kid
You can't speak with a mouth of stones
You can't preach with a false set of bones
Welcome back to the world
Believe in what you are told
We get confused so we feel abused
Day in and day out I stare into an open sunset
Waiting for the dark to arise
Oh god I'm feeling so blessed
Devour all good we have left
I can't speak through my mouth when it's moving
I can't sleep cause like I'm losing the fight
You had something to love but you fucked it
Hold it in this time just swallow your pride
Welcome back to the world
Surrender is the only way out
You're just a number dead or alive
Day in and day out
I can't speak through my mouth when it's moving
I can't sleep cause like I'm losing the fight
You had something to love but you lost it
Hold it in this time just swallow your pride
It's the reason you're bent and you're broken
You had something to love but you lost it
Hold it in this time just swallow your pride
You're all just like me
Lose blood and break bone
Move stone to get home
Just to find what you believe
We share the same hopes choke on the same ropes
I left my heart in the dark
Where it can't be seen
Thousand open wounds
They won't be hurting me
I'm the black sheep
That doesn't come when you call
Just treat me with respect
We're all made from flesh and bones
I'm stuck like a thorn in your eyes
I turn every living hour from day into night
I want you stab my soul once again
It's not gonna hurt
We are here until the end
It's not gonna hurt
We are here until the end
No it's not gonna hurt
Cause I refuse to be anything like them
Anything like you
I refuse to be anything like you
I wish I could be a stranger
If I was then you wouldn't find out
I've got a head full of violent pictures
No way to work it out and I know now
When I was young I wanted to grow older
Now I'm grown can I take it all back
I've got a head full of violent pictures
I made them all myself I know now
But my friends and memories of dreaming of you
Take me backwards I don't want to know who I am
You just walked away
By the grace of God
I'll wake up in the morning with nothing
But my friends and memories of dreaming of you
Take me backwards
Take me backwards
Take me backwards
I don't want to know who I am
Are you lost somehow drowning in the crowd
Are you on your own again
Right back at the start
Kid don't lose your heart
Until you're were you want to be
Down at the cold steps where no light exists
That's where you want to be feeling sick
You find your hopes and your abandoned dreams
That's where you find your purpose
Sometimes I take another breath
Another step to embrace what I have
Then I stare at you staring back
And I know that I'm not dead
It takes a voice to make a change
It takes courage to not be the same
If the world is silenced today
I make sure to scream my name
Take it in and let it burn
Are you lost somehow drowning in the crowd
Are you on your own again
Right back at the start
Kid don't lose your heart
Until you're where you want to be
Don't lose your heart
There are pains in life
It won't be easy
Don't lose your heart
Part of being accepted
Is to accept yourself
Don't lose your heart
It's the pulse that beats
And your voice that speaks
Don't lose your heart
If you're willing to change willing to fight
Promise me
Don't lose your heart
Remind yourself
You're breathing
Remind yourself
That you are bleeding
Are you lost somehow drowning in the crowd
Are you on your own again
Right back at the start
Kid don't lose your heart
Until you're where you want to be
Here I am alone
Watching demons sing
I've feared their smiles
When they stared at me
Out of darkness springs the light
From the fire we ignite
I can feel it
Can you feel it too
My heart has placed itself right next to you
We've lost the moon
When we swallowed the sun
And then we realized we were not the only ones
We were not the only ones
Who fight like we do
Who love like we do
If you could see the things I've seen
There's a bright side to suffering
It doesn't matter what you think
You know that we're all the same
It shows your colors and sheds your skin
Where do you go where have you been
We have to wake up
Before we fall asleep
Hands on the pulse
Till it fucking beats
Here I am alone
Watching demons sing
I've feared their smiles
When they stared at me
Out of darkness springs the light
From the fire we ignite
I was dancing with the devil
I was kneeling to the cross
There is one thing I can promise
Love is my only god
If you could see the things I've seen
There is a bright side of suffering
Show your colours
Shed your skin
Where have you gone
Where have you been
Where have you been
Where have you been
come down to my echo mind
feverdreams of neurotic kind
but I cannot feel you
head down and straight in line 
feverdreams of a foreign tribe
but I cannot feel you
come ride on a starfish's spine
6 1  7  and 49
but I cannot feel you
would you join my starfish ride
for a 6  1  7 and 49
no tears no more cries
no predicted paradise
no dreams  no more scars
no love to forever last
hey little lucifer inside
way down for handshake time
scorn for the devil and love is mine
but I cannot feel you
would you join my watergun ride
for a 6  1  7 and 49
but I cannot feel you
no tears no more cries
no predicted paradise
no dreams  no more scars
no pain to forever last
hey Mr Lucifer  you're mine
deep inside I'm dying
deep inside I'm hiding
deep inside my every word a cry alone I cry
deep inside I'm heartless
deep inside regardless
kill for me  my every word a lie
deep inside a child
when tears and dreams go wild when
deep inside comedian for life
say will I die for you
see I was always there to run
will I deny for you
the smiling scarecrow on your tongue
say will I die for you
see I was always there to run
say will I die for you
deep inside I'm dying
deep inside I'm hiding
speak to me the words
of love and trust
I feel distrust
burn for me my neonworld to dust
say will I die for you
and in the distance I'm alive
and in the distance I'm alive
and in the distant smile I'll pass on by
and cross the plans you made the suns you burned
the distance walks away
say will I die for you
we are children of the sun
we are children of the rain
pale and wonderful and wild
we are children of the rain
we are children of the sun
we are children of the rain
walking handsome brave and sane
we god's children down the drain
you know this night we can't save you
goodbye small world undergone
you know this night we can't heal you
goodnight small world undergone
you know this night we can't save the world
nor do we save you any time at all
the autumn in your eyes
the salty dark within your veins
we walk the streets at night
a searing spark inside our cage
your light it burns so painful
turn around and burn me painful
no light can release my pain
not a young god
I spit in the eyes of the marching sane
and in the young ones
and the world will turn in vein
the autumn in your smile
don't dare to walk another way
and when there's no behind don't look back
we praise the dawning day
your light it burns so painful
turn around and burn me painful
no light can release my pain
no light can release my pain
not a young god
a tiptoeing knife in the back they reign
all the young ones
no light can release my pain
walk in the rain boy
hurry my pale boy  run
talk to the screen boy
splinter the green boy  run
and while we're waiting to feel the sunlight
and while he's running so far from home
and while we welcome the same old morning
our dreamer walks alone
bury your spleen boy
feed the machine boy  run
slave to the grind boy
ashgrey in mind boy  run
and while waiting to feel the sunlight
and while he's running so far from home
and while we welcome the same old mourning
our hero walks alone
kill the sun
kill the moon
kill the stars
kill the sun
kill the moon
and your stars
kill me entertain me
get the hell out of your stars
kill me entertain me
get the hell out of your scars
we laid on the back on a latesummernight
when we ran out of words we could say
like two stranded stars on a deepfrozen sky
so gone but afraid not to say
we counted the stars any latesummernight
and we watched their departure all day
tomorrow we'll join 'em we dreamt many times
but tomorrow was so far away
and the moon and the stars
and the summernight sky
that dirty old barn and the grey in our eyes
the harbour the sea and the rivers of plight
and still we're so far away
and still we lay on the back
another latesummernight
so gone but afraid not to stay
you run deeper and faster
you run past the disaster
you run a smile in the suitcase
you run a nowhere inside
you know you'll never fly
so close you tried to feel the fire
but to forever try
one day your wings will learn to fly
you run restless and wired
you run trembling and tired
you scream  out to the nowhere
Justine  alone against the tide
you know you'll never fly
your name won't be no running fire
but to forever try
one day your feet will sear the sky
and while the miles fly away
memories decay
the years are dying
each year for birthday a card
few words from the heart
a note from the run
you stop
taking a breath while
you lock away the past miles
sit down
the running is over
Justine  I know where you hide
you know you'll never fly
your name won't be no running fire
but to forever try
one day your steps will take you higher
all night  fire longs for fireflies
all night  lightened by a handgun fire
war is over  and tonight reload my arms
all night  shaking down the smile I hide
all night  happiness when words collide
war is over  and tonight we'll carry on
war is over and gone
war is over and gone
there' no god there's no god on my trace
there's no god in the smile on my face
there's no god in the hands that I shake
there's no god in the kiss that I rape
silence in my heart
silence in my heart
war ain't over  and tonight I'm out for more#
all night  burning down the bedroom light
all night  carnage people by my side
Merlin the sea lunar delight
Merlin my dear uranium bride
Merlin my birth my solar grenade
Merlin so real is what I elate
come and get me
and we dive away now
utopian grey now
Merlin my fear my cosmic perfume
Merlin the seed the snake I consume
Merlin my sin my Lilith in flames
take me away on luminous trains
come and get me
and we dive away now
utopian grey now
Merlin try to break me take me hate me
Merlin try to haunt me be my sun
and we dive away now
utopian grey now
there in the dark it's the only abuse
walking frail to the guardian light
there in the dark where the road is a fuse
And he said
will you be a light for me
to seduce to elude to grin
will you be a light for me
walking in for a holy sin
there in the dark it's the only abuse
that I can't get out of his sight
there in the dark it's the only abuse
when the frail old man he smiles
And he says
will you be a bride for me
on your knees for a second run
will you shoot the sky for me
stealing streetlight just for fun
I cannot see your sun so far away
I cannot be four lightyears far away
I cannot see your sky so far away
I cannot see your light another day
there in the dark  
ten years older and wise
still there's a frail frail guardian light
there in the dark  back to preach of the night
see the face of the old man is mine
gaze of the old man is mine
for a while sunlight has faded
for a while the liveboats have passed
for a while children corroded
and all we see is utopian grasp
for tonight I feel not sorry
for tonight a cigarette for god
for tonight don't dare to call me
'cause I'm not here I'm out for a walk
for a life for god and the nation
for a life forget how to love
for a life walking courageous
and all we fear is the heaven above
and for now I drink to the faithless
to the weak the crippled the tall
and for now tomorrow and anon
I don't know if I've survived my sleep
Don't you know me I'm your agony
Don't detest me Try to live inside me
I want to break through your skin but
I don't mind I don't care
I can't see the sky from here
What have you done
I don't mind I don't care
I can't feel my soul down here
What have you done
You're getting closer trying to leave
Begging for mercy please let me be
Can't you see it
Life becomes unreal
Can't you feel it
I'm inside your skin
I can't see you when you're here
I can feel you when you're near
Smell your breathe somewhere near you soar
Saw your smile it left my soul to die
You can't make me do your deeds
Never gonna feel your greed
I can feel you're there between the lines
Faceless at the time
Wounded smile choose among the lies
Saw your smile it left my soul to die
Jesus Christ please stab my eyes
Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
Deep inside the shell rankles the pain
Knee deep inside yourself wreck of the insane
You serve the shame
You serve the shame
Loss to fill expose your will use the child
simple needs perversities abuse the pride
Loss to fill I'll be your sin without name
simple needs perversities you serve the shame
Wallow in the deeds Unable to feel
Too late to repent this mind must be sealed
You serve the shame
You serve the shame
Turning into my mind
The mirror's eyes smile back at me
Fed me with your madness
Burnt the cradle to the ground
Created a beast of sadness
Now I'm searching to be found
Reaping the seed you sowed
Left alone to grow
Where do we go
I don't know
Reaping the seed you sowed
Time has come no longer care
I wanted love you gave me fear
See my life broke in half
Frozen sea you left for me
See my life broke in half
Set my soul to fly
Someone has to die
And I feel you
Someone has to die
And I feel you
Someone has to die
I know I know
You know you know
I'm the one to be
There can't be two of us in me
And I feel you
Someone has to die
And I feel you
Someone has to die
I know I know
You know you know
I know I know
You know you know
Someone has to die
Someone has to die
Seal your eyes and use them inside
See if you know who I am
Feed your lies and breed them a while
Meet them again when you're near
Under skin left within
Seamless scars can't deny
From the inside Crucified
In silence resentment bleeds through
Somewhere your past will resort
Feeling dry I'm dying
You know why
Drained from the wound that won't heal
Under skin left within
Seamless scars can't deny
From the inside Crucified
So I lie in my stench
Decorated in my self
Scarcely here mind astray
In myself hate I crawl away
I still burn for you
I saw you bleed
Same mistake I made again made again
Who am I faceless mask
All what's left cracked like glass
I still burn for you
I saw you bleed
Same mistake I made again made again
So if I burn
Would have done it all the same all the same
So I lie in my stench
Decorated in my fence
I saw you bleed
The same mistake
Don't fade away into the gray
Don't fade away into the gray
Don't fade away into the gray
I'm using life
It's true I don't mind if you leave
You're fated I'm always relieved
I hope you understood the words unsaid
So many rooms inside my head
Too many different places
Sometimes I'm dying to be dead
Too many lovely faces
It's like a poison to me
I ain't what you see
I'm too scared to be
Won't you set me free
Leave it all to be
I won't pretend
I'm not scared to death of being left alone
My love for you is still unknown
I'm getting closer and I use my wile
I crack the liars smile
I won't just live my life to die
I'm getting high from being vile
There is no use to ask me why
It's like a poison to me
I see you drowning in my eyes
I crack the liars smile
I won't just live my life to die
I'm getting high from being vile
There's no use to ask me why
It's like a poison to me
I don't know and I don't care
I ain't going anywhere
I don't care and I don't mind
Pound my head against the ground
Once I've seen your face
I'm caught up in the maze
I'm snared in your fatal embrace
Turn inside yourself ease your mind
Turn inside yourself release your mind
My body's alive but I'm not inside
And I see broken pictures floating body overmine
Floating high
What I only wanted was to fly
Turn inside yourself ease your mind
Turn inside yourself release your mind
And I see pictures coming clear
See your body next tomine
Floating high
All I ever wanted was to fly
And I see pictures come alive
Broken faces twisted smiles
I've seen enough and close my eyes
Can not live and can not die
Mind floating high all I ever wanted was to fly
Take me in your arms
I need to rest
Rest my head against your chest
Stop me from drifting
It feels like I'm fading away away
Father O Father I know you can see
I'm in pain
Always remain lost out in the rain
Help me to carry carry the stone
Life's running out of an open wound
When twisting and turning
Endlessly burning you soothe you soothe me
Seems every beat of my heart brings me
Closer to death every breathe
All my candles have burned out
I wish there could be
Mercy for me
Begging on my knees
Praying to find peace
I wish there could be
Mercy for me
Begging on my knees
Praying to find peace
Hope is wearing thin as ice
When my feelings slowly die
Is there anyone there
Am I all alone
Through the flesh to the bone
Thorn sticks deep inside me
Can you feel me I am wrong
Can you see me I am gone
From the things I have denied
Feel the smell Feel the smell
From what once was me
I am trapped in myself
Buried in my body
Can you feel me I am wrong
Can you see me so long gone
I am lost I'm on my own
All my feelings turned to stone
To stone
To stoneHell on earth the day has come
The beast is here don't try to run
Bodies decaying  nothing is left
Burning your churches evil remains
The Army of Darkness is finally here
The Angel of Death is nothing to fear
Demonic forces are hard to resist
Feeding your hunger beyond the mist
Evil Will Rise
The Beast Has Survived
Ruling The Night
Taking Your Lives
Human survivors are taking a stand
Fighting together they do all they can
Screaming for help they die one by one 
Your Life is over the damage is done
Evil is back now the day has come
From hell they came to claim his throne
Demonic forces are hard to resist
Feeding your hunger beyond the mist
Evil Will Rise
The Beast Has Survived
Ruling The Night
Taking Your Lives
Blood from the wounds of the one you call Christ
Fills the empty void evil is alive
Feel it inside it's burning you away
Rotten to the core my body will decay
I see it in your eyes the fire's burning bright
Demons want you soul they're hiding in the night
You're hoping to be saved but God is just a lie
Everyone obey now or you'll fucking die
Shout at the devil evil all around
Powerful and merciless Satan wears his crown
In the final battle  we must choose a side
Apocalyptic nightmare wont you run and hide
Fighting till the end with Satan at my back  
Killing Gods angels an all out attack
Into the gates of hell you see me disappear
Vengeance rains
Highest in the end
And its gonna burn
You cant tame
The beast
He's far too strong
Choose a side
Walk with us and be proud
Or he'll suck out your soul
Hunt you down
Suck it out
Woah
Marching to the fields leaving all behind
Bliss and satisfaction is what we get for hell
Take away your soul your just a empty shell
Kill with no remorse a total genocide
Dance with the beast and no ones left alive  
You're hoping to be saved but God is just a lie
Everyone obey now or you'll fucking die
Fire burning proud in our veins
We await the thrill
Feeding the darkness as we charge to the front
Blood turns to boil
We cannot change the fate of the night
Flames are burning hot
Turning our heads to the left and the right
We're aware that something's just not right
Some faces just don't belong
Their heat spreads like disease
And it's spreading fast
As the lion hunts the gazelle
I feel you creeping near
As my body embraces the ground
My vision is redeemed
Adrenaline feeds my hunger now
You cannot escape the flame
Feed the fire
Feed the fire
Feed the fire
I've lost all control
Feed the fire
And burn 'em slow
Something snaps inside of me
My hell is breaking loose
Fire is unleashing
The pain that is hunting you
I light my torch carburize the flame
Melting your eyeballs to your face
Hang you up high waiting to die
I watch and eat whatever hit's the ground
Feed the fire
We cannot change the fate of the night
Flames are burning hot
Blood vessels dilate animal thirst annihilates
Nuclear disaster there's nowhere to hide
They're taking no chances I'm losing my mind
Faster and faster I'm not looking back
Start the reactor It's time to attack
So gather the troops and get ready to fight
Slashing the head of the queen in the night
The bombs are falling we ran out of time
Women and children the first ones to die
Nuclear disaster
Pile up the corpses get ready to die
Just a disaster 
Start the reactor it's time to attack
Killing for money just sign on the line
Living and dying is just part of life
Give me a gun or just give me a knife
Filling your head with deception and hate
Don't try to run it's just too late
Leaving behind all the humans remains
Mindless destruction all over the place
Nuclear disaster
Pile up the corpses get ready to die
Just a disaster
Start the reactor it's time to attack
Nuclear disaster
Pile up the corpses get ready to die
Just a disaster
Start the reactor it's time to attack
Nuclear disaster
Start the reactor it's time to attack
Lurking in a shadow not far from hell 
Silence in the bone yard before the storm
666 is the mark of the maker
Awake the metal monsters to begin domination
With nothing to loose
High tensile they stand
To battle they soar
Metal machine 
Peening your skull
It's an attack
Eternal destruction they spare no lives
There is no hope total genocide
Metal machine with pride they ride
The toughest anvils bareback and free
Metal machine
Metal machine
Metal machine
Metal machine 
Metal machine
It's an attack
Grinder to the faces of those who breathe
Chop sawing bones into little pieces
Pile drive the mess into human stew
Metal machines ruling the world
Metal machine
In the beginning
Rimmed with wind and storm
A great black wrath of infinite math
Spat snarling into form
And there was Heaven
Lit up with precious stones
Each one could fall but for the rule
Of Faith and love and stronger thrones
And therein rose vast wonders
Affections to be seen
Fathered from the plundered
Reflections of a dream
Fogging into nightmare
For him whose place was set
With wayward stars that absent marred
All creation with their theft
In the beginning
Bewinged and ringed with dawn
This favoured Avatar enthralled
Swansongs from those that thronged this shore
With Gabriel and Michael
He shone with fierce intent
For loyalty their joy to see
Him spur the hymns to heaven sent
For sculptured lips of seraphim
Whom fate then cruelly rent
With sleight fingered strains of harmony
Each note to grim portent
As grinning nimbus gathered
Over spires arabesque
For Him that blazed with holy praise
That for a jealous God was meant
Shining Feriluce
Lustrous scourge of fallen spirits
Basked in glory flew
To lakes in sacred altitudes
Sweet haunting music swathed the breeze
With curling tongues that lapped the lead
Until at last past grasping trees
He paused to draught forbidden streams
That whispered siren promises
To drown his thirst for sports amiss
These waters held secrets
Like raped Russian dolls
Wherein evil and good
Tore his soul for control
And drunk with the verse of desire's first words
The weight of the universe
Slunk in rehearsed
Horror in numbers too great to discern
The rotting of worlds to the conqueror worm
And love a rare orchid so fragile in bloom
Espied gasping breath under dark sheeted moons
Shining Feriluce
Reflected in jaded mirror
Climbing from the noose
Of time in divine servitude
And thus a strange new melody
Of will and wanton fantasies
Whetted by the veiled seen
Danced from his ashen lips
In red dawn scores the silver scream
Of truth and her deleted scenes
Was taken up as far it seemed
As God his words eclipsed
Those waters hid visions
Like butchers in war
Perverting the course
Of life's blood evermore
In the beginning
Skinned well with gibbous tones
Of countenance and ignorance
In equal measures sewn
A marbled arc of Angels
Sworn to the morningstar
Shared His pride and deep inside
Felt Chill Shadows sweep their cards
Distant vistas
Swathed in the haze
Of the reddening sunset
Fell to whispers
'Neath stars that marred descending skies
From the cusp of midnight mountains
Wending as a mist
Rebels truced with Feriluce
In truth few could resist
Came praising his hellraising through
The sparse and marble clime
Where Virtue bathed their ravings made
Her fountains flood with wine
Lifted with the gift
Of their dark seductive songs
She drifted from the path
She was surely set upon
Courting chaos
Prized in sight
Of the covering angel
Taught in ways of
Smothering another lover
Other than God
Worshipped in each other's arms
Like spider eidolons
The moon conducted like a charm
Those strange arrangements on
And this is how they came to be
Dragged before the throne
Through tongues that hung whilst theirs were run
On soft white throats and punctured moans
Though fated now than later
By his tutor that had been
He baited the Creator
With the future he had seen
Of Michael psyched with jealousies
A reich right by His side
And worming Man about to be
The apple of His eye
His children lost to free will
And the cost of beaten hearts
Like the night 'twixt vice and Virtue
When Her kiss became a scar
Seraph enemies
Why has my lord forsaken my judgment
From embittered lips
These words were slavered
Split with the whips
Of their witch hunt gathered
He sought Her gaze
Midst drowning crowds that howled in rage
Blasphemer
Blasphemer
Though she was gone
Not lyriced to the song of their spirited throng
But ghosted back where she belonged
A grace embracing Michael
In a lace of tears that bleared Her pride
He swallowed
Blood followed
Though with spit for all things divine
Though with spit for all things so fucking blind
His seal He tore
And to the floor
He threw this tie to heaven
Signifying holy war
And watchful of this sign
A thousand flames unauthorised
Left celestial posts
To coalesce and unified
Return their fallen leader
As he turned one final time
And threw a glance
Like a downward lance
That stung like guilt in every mind
As pride precedes the downfall
So he took His place before the firewall
Of dissonant choirs whose faith in one
Was embraced in this wraith whose fate was hung
Between forgiveness and the damage done
An electric scent over drear decay
Lent a violent surge to their serenades
Through white glades as His winged parade
Bent to silhouette and to sharpen dull razors
Within vast skies unversed in starkness
His might grew
And blew light hues to grey
And worse a third of stars to darkness
Then thunder seethed
And wreathed in thickening night
A line was drawn midst wrong and right
And across the throat of thieves
As love fell choked the tempest broke
From Heaven's farthest shore
Descending to eclipse all hope
Repentance might stay holy war
He would not heel nor fake a bow
Murmur curses to the wind
Enraged he raved in balrog howls
Upon a storm firstborn of sin
Incensed anew rebellious tore
Like frenzied beasts of prey
Through temple doors
Thrown east before the midnight masses
And where once bliss reigned so serene
In sweeter glades
Now veins ran openly
Like eyes that shed from kindred ashes
When suddenly
There shone a hideous light
And a voice like three insanities
Soared up in thistled speech
Thou hast bred hate where there dwelt none
And for this grave mistake
How thou art fallen Morning Sun
The proud will be abased
He would not heel nor fake a bow
Murmur curses to the wind
And lo the wrath of god swept down
Thou art no more an angel filled
With light but a leech to be abhorred
And thou shalt suffer My burning will
Quoth this raven Nevermore
Never fucking more
And with these words like heavy stone
Cast against that gilded throne
With many legions still in tow
He turned his wings to flee
His eyes a picture of distaste
Drawn to tears and in their place
The dawn of time and fates to face
Through all eternity
I wept for him a deep red river
That ran like blood through scarred ravines
To sluice away the guilt that slithered
Like a serpent tongue to Eve
For once as I in heaven climbed
Too high for truth to truly see
My sunken mind drunken and blind
Saw the lie The fool was Me
Alone and cold face to the crack
Beyond the dark gates with no way back
His crown of gold faded to black
Like a bruise upon the heart that lingers
With thrillkill culture shock wave lengths
Of rope to hang high
Ten commandments by
Snaked about his upraised fingers
Better to reign in hell
Better to reign in hell
Heart in hand passed clasp of pain
In dark lowland that set bad blood in veins
Burning like penal fires roused to strain
The jaggedtoothed skyline braced with crosses
The golden dawn
Lay lost to mist where
Emboldened thorns
Made their bed with toppled stones
He closed His eyes
Sunken to dream there
Of crowblack skies
And a great white empty throne
Horror stalked the bilious fogs
That balked his visions
He licked the spittle from the cheeks of the wry
And drifted back to when His stung its target
The sneer of Michael on a glorious high
Of angel dust and Virtue by his side
Drowning in the past
That downfall seemed like yesterday
Though blurred moons passed
As enemies in high places laughed
Moved to mirrors cracked with heavy lines
He rose snowblind through shifting sands of time
Erased the trace and taste of bitter wines
The grapes of wrath grew fat on the vine
She came to Him
A little whip of tantrums
Thrashed on velvet skins
That lines Her wishbone Henge
Her name was Sin
A warming spurt of mantras
Splashed on occult tongues
That whispered sweet revenge
For the shame of their crawl from grace
Cold and hollow as the grave
And for a rape and ruinous scourge
Spared for souls that shared God's worship
For now their throats coated notes with dirge
That poured from parapets to the pits below
Drowning in the past
A wretched scream like yesterday
Died at last
With the rising of the revenant dark
All sharpened claws and blunt discharge
I shall bow no more to the dogs of the Lord
Tearing at my carcass heart
I shall fall to my knees only at the keyholes
Of Virtue slipping into bondage masks
Freewill made me better to reign in hell
And with new wings
Unfurled and spoken
He took to things
That would desecrate the world
The seduction of both woman and man
For a bastard masterplan
Drowning out the past
Fool Fates unwound cruel yesterdays
beneath the stars
That staggered from the blast
So adept was unspoken Man
At dusting ledgers of the seraphim
That Lilith swept across the broken land
In a whirl of lust to pleasure him
This bland Adam a reaper of the sun
Breathless as the wind
Adam prowled fell foul to Sin
But not before She spread Her grin
Across His silent lips
At crack of day though what was shame
The raptor's nest wherein they lay
Bore witness to Her soft parade
Of fingers come to grips
His undivine attention won
She deftly spun
From 'neath His thrusts to writhe above
In ecstasy
Pendulous She swung
As if her limbs imbibed His tongue
To spill as with His rod
The secret name of God
But no seed passed those fruitful lips
Serpent Tongue
For fearing Her who grasped He slit
Serpent Tongue
Her throat from ear to where She fled
Serpent Tongue
With tail and blood between Her legsss
So very kept was the virgin hand
That brushed the treasures of Utopia
And how the greed swept across the desert sands
In late August just to measure Her
This hallowed Eve a creature of the moon
A simple dish born with a silver spoon
Giddy sniffing orchids that opened after dusk
Incubus and Prudence two such swoon to touch Her
Restless as the skies
Temptation bloomed found room to rise
And snatching breaths between Her thighs
He crawled to Eve
At dead of night the sticky clime
Smelt perfect to this serpentine
This shining Angel
Palled in mysteries
Her undivine attention won
He deftly spun
A web of  for the one
Great sacred tree
Bejewelled  and lit
As if a thousand shades did flit
About boughs of forbidden lore
Hidden for the want of more
And when seeds passed those fruitful lips
And Mankind basked in vast eclipse
A Devil shot of thin disguise
Surmised to better paradise
Lurking in the shade
Of dark and fragrant trees
Shirking from the rage
That tore the heavens free
A vagrant Angel
His with span to see
The garden swell with terrors
To banish man and Eve
Another fall from grace
Whiplashed from the gates
Halfnaked and insane
Fullblooded breasted
Nerve ends tested
To behests of pain
A sombre lot to gain
A storm slid in
Borne by carnal winds
The upper ether thinned
And therein sat abominations
Satan seated there
Savouring the reek of desolation
Their dank despair
Moved His speech to leech the air
Behold the golden door
To paradise is lost
So praise Me as you raised your Lord
And I shall thaw this gnawing frost
Another fall from grace
Whiplashed from the gates
Halfnaked and insane
And destined for a spiteful Fate
Wherein evil sought the shamed
As pawns in greater stakes
Across this cosmic game
To win the hand
Of darkness and
Set Her in her rightful place
At the throat of the human race
With claws engorged and poised to rake
With that the pact was sealed
And as creation reeled
Bewitched oration filled
The hearts of all
Who came to crawl
Upon these earthen fields
A sombre lot to till
A wracked black acid song
Spat from the massive throng
Of Seraph knelt along
The deep red welt to domination
The deep red welt to domination
Reigning at the feast of Phantasia
Heightened pleasures were endeavoured to bow
Before My coronation and vocal aspirations
To rule this fool creation fallen 'neath me now
I knew deep eyes
Of a distant Christ
Were scarred from afar under starry lustre
Sighting my recitals on the rites of vice
Perverting Virtue
Enslaving grace
Behind the glittering mask of pride
Saving face finding thorns to pierce His side
Desire the fire
Spread hell throughout my soul
And higher the wire
The more I sought control
Straining from the leash in exultation
Head to the wind to breathe with ravenous lungs
The global scent of fornication
A writhe of many vipers deciphering tongues
I whispered schemes to dreamers then
To pursue an Eden
That screamed of me supreme again
As my world bloomed
So too the moon
Through Adam to Seth Enos Cainan
Mahalaleel and Jared blew
Perverting virtue
Enslaving grace
Behind the slippery guise of lies
Saving face making waves to drown their faith
Messiahs Pariahs
Aeons reversed the two
This higher their spires
The more cursed grew their roots
And suffering
I swept cruel seas
On the galley of the shadow of death
A fist in the cunt of the spread horizon
A kiss for the sun risen red once dines on
The coast of Menses
Discharged from celestial wombs
A first degree murder of ravens
Followed in fugue through the crack of doom
The Goat of Mendes
I set regime
In the galley of the shadow of death
Angels in raiments
As pure as coal
Taking their payments
In tortured mortal souls
A bold direction
The abyss edge
But on cold reflection
One they warmed to nonetheless
As they preyed the paths of the righteous
Through the myth of thistled orchard floors
Bearing gifts of plenitude for
The apples of the Lord were rotten to the core
Temptation my ambassador
Attila Hesiod Pharisees and Nero
All begged of Me for more
Down dark steps of history
I waged war with a heaven
I could not see
Beyond my wildest fantasies
Throwing sixes over deadly sin
I traded whose who played to win
Skin for precious kin
And that that wormed within
Staining the reams of revelation
Etching everafters in accursed verse
The limpid rags of resurrection
From papal parapets were to dirt dispersed
Desire the flyers
Spread hell throughout their souls
And higher the fire
The more I held control
To and fro through freeze and thaws
From zenith to nadir
The universal tug of war
Saw lines drawn in the sands appear
Divisions of a promised land
And Hell for those that dwelt
Beneath a Pharaoh's granite hand
Where death wed something else
Millennia swam passed
Since the covened Ark
Ran aground on Ararat
But anew tempered shadows grew
Out of Midian strewing fear
Over verdant lawns the resurgent storms
Led a desert son to sear
From the palace orchard I espied
Where swooning trees and moonless beams vied
For the painted eye of the royal bride
Whose gliding curves were deified
beyond Her grace where love would die
Wretched destiny arrive
Back and forth the prophet came
Riddled with a tongue of plagues
That would render might Egypt lame
If the rage of God stayed unassuaged
I listened with a heavy heart
But unveiled to the threats
This Hebrew in a jackal's mask
Would dredge into effect
Thenceforth the Nile reddened
s if Set stretched His hand
To beset the damned
And bruised with flies
The skies grew leadened
But these miracles feared
Were all but reared
By nature whose law alone
Stood that revered
This hysteria passed but still the mark
Of Yahveh burned on in the dark
One final time on the steps to the shrine
Of Thoth I twined with fate
Let my people go
Still my word is no
Then Death shall be the deciding plague
Since the crimes divine I left behind
I'd warred with every tribe that plied
In holy vestament but with time
Bored sore of clawing what was mine
I laid my bones and made my throne
With a view to paradise
Thenceforth the heavens deafened
As if great beasts
Were unleashed to feast on man
And with carrion span
Michael was weaponed
To descend with scorn
A dark reform
Through PiRamses
Skinning mine and Her firstborn
Thus suspiria passed each sacred mark
Of Yahveh bleeding in the dark
With nauseous dawn a cry forlorn
Unified from plazas deep
The prophet's curse
Far worse had worked
To wrest the war in me from sleep
Drowned in light a downward light
Bathed the snaking exodus
Through the wilderness
As the Aeons crept
Impressed with fresh bloodlust
I bled on a pivotal stretch
Like a clockwork Christ
Bears sore stigmata bored
And as I threw Job I drove
Myself to a martyred wretch
To see if I drew pity
Or pretty litanies from the Lord
So the plot sickened
With the coming of days
Ill millennia thickened
With the claret I sprayed
And though they saw red
I left a dirty white stain
A splintered know in the grain
On Eden's marital aid
So glad for the madness
I walked the walls naked to the moon
In Sodom and Babylon
And through rich whores and corridors
Of the Vatican
I led a sordid Borgia on
I read the Urilia text
So that mortals wormed
As livebait for the dead
And as I broke hope I choked
Another pope with manna peel
Dictating to DeSade
In the dark entrails of the Bastille
And as he wrote I smote
A royal blow to the heads of France
And in the sheen of guillotines
I saw others fallen dance
I was an incurable
Necromantic old fool
A phagadaena that crawled
Drooling over the past
A rabid wolf in shawl
A razor's edge to the rule
That the stars overall
Were never destined to last
So glad for the madness
I furnaced dreams a poet for of sleep
Turning sermons with the smell
On Witchfinder fingers
Where bad memories lingered
Burning as when Dante
Was freed to map Hell
I sired schemes and the means
To catch sight of the seams
And the vagaries inbetween
And midst the lips and the curls
Of this cunt of a world
In glimpses I would see
A nymph with eyes for me
Eyes of fire that set all life aflame
Lights that surpassed art
In sight that no intense device of pain
Could prise their secrets from my heart
I knew not her name
Though her kiss was the same
Without a whisper of shame
As either Virtue or Sin's
And pressed to Her curve
I felt my destiny swerve
From damnation reserved
To a permanent grin
So glad for the madness
Burning flesh
Dripping sweat
Using them all
like the paralyzing snake
Charmed and enchanted by the babylon whore
Led to other worlds
By the girls she curled within
I took their skins to see Her
Be my mannequin
Be my mannequin
I cannot remember
How it was that we first met
Curve of moon and haunted shore
The stars were not those Heaven sent
Did we come together
At masked palatial Balls
In silks and flesh and leather
Or did we come at all
I dreamt a midnight castle
The eerie song of wolves
And eyes that danced with fire
As they have forever more
Our rites of sin
Have long fathered a hymn
To burden Him
Whom by slip of after whim
At genesis
Dressed Her like the wind
In Autumn gowns
That pinned Her down
To be my mannequin
Be my mannequin
Always poised on winter
But never would She break
My lovecraft and black witch heart
That pounded in Her wake
We kissed on distant balconies
A law unto Her own
Thirteenth dark commandment
Of figures pressed to stone
Turning cream with fantasies
That God alone would know
We graced vomitorium
With the sweet excess of Rome
Flagrant in the past
Led to other worlds
By the girls she curled within
I took their skins to see Her
Be my mannequin
Be my mannequin
I tongued the nuns at Louviers
But not one word possessed
Her divine right an archetype
For mortal Goddesses
I I still recall the first fullmoon of May
'Neath whose rays we lay together
And those bright nights on glassy waves
When we would glide lightly away
From the grain
For wicked flights of pleasure
Those visions fade
Like ghosts to life's parade
Though incisions once made her so vivid
A scarlet whore
With both heels in the door
Of a heaven severed from me insipid
And midst the writhe of parapets
Where angels sigh lonely she sits
Upon the lip
Only a slip from whence I beg Her
That I would wish
Her kiss a chrysalis
To break to make my fluttered heart amiss
And in those frozen moments won
From grief that creeps to wreathe the sun
in drapes inwove with deathshead wing
I thank God for the suffering
Love would have conquered all
But for the Rapture
That ancient plan for my defeat
Denied Faith skies that would have set Her free
It seems again dreams wend to capture
Once dancing in a spotlit waltz
Through shadowed dimension
Given to the rivers that bedizened Her eyes
The world drifted by in lost momentum
With no divine intervention
Regardless that the author
Of sin was me and I
Lay chaste of hate in Faith's embrace
As Mortals warred with more besides
They warred with life itself
And in those frozen moments won
From grief that creeps to wreathe the sun
In drapes inwove with deathshead wing
I thank God for the suffering
And I thank God for the suffering
As still I burn
For Her return
I would make my peace with everything
I I still recall the first fullmoon of May
Consigned to flames like secret letters
And midst the writhe of parapets
Where angels sigh lonely she sits
Upon the lip
Only a slip from whence I beg her
That I would wish
Her kiss a chrysalis
To break to make my fluttered heart amiss
And in those frozen moments won
From grief that creeps to wreathe the sun
In drapes inwove with deathshead wing
I thank God for the suffering
Love would have conquered all
Were we not parted
Her splintered loss rekindles rage
The winter frost dwindles across my stage
Lit up once more to score finales started
Love would have conquered all
Love would have conquered
Hate
Earth and sea cower from my screams
As I climb into the skies
Atop sins towered heaven high for me
From whence I see no reason why
I should not smite with vengeance
And hurl thieves down from paradise
For storms before were as nothing more
Than a breeze next to this night
I am Methuselah of the Tribulation
The Moonchild come to harm
A riot of stars shaken from their station
The choking smoke of Jerusalem burning
Six vices become wrath
And though halfblind with ravening
Like Phineus now I see
The end declared from the beginning
Love won through my defeat
But now I fear I will never peer
On Her radiance again
I shall glimpse instead the slurried red
Of faces pressed to bloodstained panes
Betrayed and played by God
Who alone but He
Scapegraced and goated me
Now I wish to piss on His parade
Angels clawed with burnished wings
Still loyal kiss the seal
Bent on knees and harrowing
Promise overkill
Know that you shall die like whores
And the cries of your writhings shall rise
To please their Lord
So before the sword
Side with me in slaughter
I am Methuselah of the Tribulation
The Moonchild come to harm
The spoken horns of desolation
Drink the pouring of my fury
Those darkened waters spur
The brink of war as my judge and jury
And rapist executioner
Our time is short the horsemen ride
A foulbreathed chora howls besides
Damnation and a day has passed
This divine right to genocide
Weld the gates to heaven shut
The abyss leers in hissing ruts
Unhilt the black grimoire of death
Inscribe all names that God has left
I lived the dream of nymph and men
But now the nightmares come again
Now the nightmares come again
Days has turn into perpetual nights
The horns of anguish is blowing hellish
Our doom now sealed in utter darkness
Tormented and weak we rest in pain
Eternal affliction will confine us all
Bereavement shall sweep through every soul
Punishment from below has come to reap
Heed the call of Armageddon
This is the day for Revelation
Kneel before the gods of Devastation
Sense the wrath of unholy Redemption
The blackened sun glimmers in obscurity
Lasting and blazing our minds insane
A final harvest is soon to commence
The dead shall now wander the earth
Down on our knees we fall
This is Doomsday's call
Praying to be speared
No mercy will be shown
Heed the call of Armageddon
This is the day for Revelation
Kneel before the gods of Devastation
Sense the wrath of unholy Redemption
This is the Ruin of Mankind
The night humanity shall fall
Now inhale your final breath
Sense the apocalyptic aftermath
The infected smell of a turning tide
Winds blow cold for the petrified
I can hear your prayer call what a pityfull lust
I see you faint I see you die
I spot a glimpse in the burning sky
I nail the book of which you feed
I watch you suffer I watch you bleed
The cult is gathered for the final round
The cross shall burn to the abysmal ground
But the flame that will burn shall never be seen
I can smell the future the oblivion dream
Chain of Royal forgotten blood
Is sealed under the rose of love
Whispers from the deepest core
Speak of Revelation the time of lore
I see you faint I see you die
I spot a glimpse in the burning sky
I nail the book of which you feed
I watch you suffer I watch you bleed
Rotten blood from head to feet
They who doesn't count their reap
The pride of what they do is shame
I shall walk the path of pain
Fear carved once in flesh
By the grails mighty nest
A wind bring fourth the greatest fire
A breath of Apocalypse as I desire
As young I traveled alone
In places the sun is dark
A land even the dead fear
Immortals with axes and spear
Born in the shadow
A shade beneath a stone
Taught by the night
How to die in fight
Forged by hollow screams
Vengeance is my beast
Immortals tore my home
I shall walk alone
I venture back and fourth
I failed to sacrifice
The mighty gods i heed
Lost is now my bead
Black is now my mind
Devouring hatred fulfilled
The dead are leaping back
It's time for another attack
Steel shimmering in twilight
Voices of helfspeak arise
I spill my blood to the one
Realizing my inner con
The legion is thoroughly formed
The ranks are reset and waiting
Swords replaced my sarkened soul
A Warrior of Northern Twilight
In the past I dreamed a dream
Of coming home to light
I found my path of walking
A roar where no ones talking
The road to perdition I ride
Amongst skulls and bones
The dead I travel along
A rotten ghoul I've become
The chill is freezing lungs
Our journey leads north
To lands where I haven't been
Castles and thrones none has seen
Humans split the ranks
By the smell of warm flesh
I hear the scream of pain
The screams that made me insane
My corpus is written
Coven many steps ahead
A great battle is dwelling
More death than the story telling
The legion is thoroughly formed
The ranks are reset and waiting
Swords replaced my sarkened soul
A Warrior of Northern Twilight
They taught me none of joy
Their mouth was all so closed
They didn't tell me right from wrong
When I wrote my ending song
Craving for blood
I stand in the front
Legend has become never ending tales
As the legion set up their mighty sails
Savage and fast
We storm their fort
Rebelling with their human mind
Reaping and thrusting every kind
What do they hold
Why do they speak
We've come here for glory
We've come here for pain
Swords sing the golden song
Survival of the sickest
Shield bash momentum
Battleages ultimatum
The legion is thoroughly formed
The ranks are reset and waiting
The clockwork frames pending
A Warrior's life ending
Hollowed by the face of fiery
I call you now a distant theory
The tale I tell is all but done
The book is open and dust is gone
The hag she goes from room to room
And weeps an endless song of doom
She's measured and weighted in torture and pain
By all of us who have gone insane
I'm in The Orphanage I used to roam
I dream a dream of coming home
My life is ending I fear it not
This is my story I haven't forgot
I'm four I think but I ain't alive
When I'm not asleep I'm down at the hive
There she beats until we bleed
So we can suffer and she can feed
In the darkest hall of domination
We pray to god for revelation
Trapped in cells of gore and steel
I tell my story the seventh seal
Soon I'm gone I hear my call
She's coming now it will be my fall
At the end I see her incarnated face
The fog has faded let me receive my grace
My tale is ending but be aware
The hag is in there spreading fear
I take my things I'll walk away
Commandment of light I will obey
The gate of Hell now open
Eternal suffering to come
No mercy to be shown
Tartarus awaits
Into the abyss we descend
Diabolic afterlife awaits below
Purgatory unleash it's wrath
Tartarus awaits
By the flames we are reborn
Slaves of the diabolical kingdom
Our souls teared apart our minds insane
Tartarus we now heed
Tartarus we now heed
Come enter the dominion of Niflheim
A wasteland so gloomy and cold
Inhale the mist and steam of death
The Day of Judgment is soon to appear
The march along the Shore of Corpses
Suffer the serpent Nighogs fury
Fallen warriors will mark the way
As twilight encircle these lifeless fields
Pass through the town of Valgrind
A black forest linger in the haze
The storm of Hraesvelg raise hellish
Gjallarbru now waits in the north
Come forth to the domain of Helheim
Come forth to the throne of Hel
Cross the bridge of no return
Fear the skulls and bones from below
The flames of Munspelheim grow higher
Garm and Modgud bid you welcome to Hel
Sense the dark aura of Helheim's rage
Lifeless souls are lurking in the fog
Look upon the dim hall of Eljudnir
The paths of Helvegr is onto an end
Come forth to the domain of Helheim
Come forth to the throne of Hel
She rest there so silent and bleak
A gruesome creature of hatred it is
The night has come for you to be slain
We we are the men with blades of bronze
We we have the Lambda on our shields
May webe given to kill
Don't need any war cries
to rush the blood to our heads
Three Hundred men the Elite Guard
You can't stop the Spartan Phalanx
Stand in the front no fear to die
You will see the Hellenic valour
Wall Wall Wall of spears and bronze
Wall Wall Wall against the foes
Bloodbath dead bodies lay on the ground
Strike now fighting our way trough their rows
Hold fast Roll in the uproar of the fight
Keenness is the key to subdue all tempting fears
Three Hundred men the Elite Guard
You can't stop the Spartan Phalanx
Stand in the front no fear to die
You will see the Hellenic valour
Wall Wall Wall of spears and bronze
Wall Wall Wall against the foes
We are the stout spawn of Valour
Bred by the Mother of War
Die like a man of Sparta
The sign of the Lambda prevails
Just a child with a blade and a shield
There's no fondness no place for the weak
In our childhood we just learn to fight
Children trained to kill for their Land
Lakedaimon  the man with no fear
Lakedaimon  the faith and the spear
Dying like a man the way of the Warrior
All my life at war under the laws of Sparta
Spartan man of war  Lakedaimon
Spartan man of war  Lakedaimon
In my eyes so cold what do you see
Is the will of the gods or is love
For my land so beloved and so strong
Spartan warrior you fight with your heart
Lakedaimon  the man with no fear
Lakedaimon  the faith and the spear
Dying like a man the way of the Warrior
All my life at war under the laws of Sparta
Spartan man of war  Lakedaimon

Brothers in arms giving their life
Fathers and sons brave men of Sparta
They stand as one against the foes
Hellenic Pride fight with Andreia
Thunder from the sky Gods of the Olympus
Marching by my side Zeus Soter Nike
Ares God of War with Phobos and Deimos
Spartan with no fear praise the Lakedeimon
Spartan man of war  Lakedaimon
Spartan man of war  Lakedaimon
Golden like the sun and as tall as our standing
We in the wind not to break nor to bend
We shining on suffering on in a blaze of glory
With a spear in my hand
And my mind in command
Pounding drums in my heart
All of you torn apart
See through the tides and the ages of time
Now it's the hour final test is at hand
Purpose in mind no retreat no way out
With a spear in my hand
And my mind in command
Pounding drums in my heart
All of you torn apart
Softly is whispering the wind
Yielding a measure of hope
Yielding good crop very soon
It'll feed our dears back home
Harvest of brave men at heart
Will truly give faith to the land
Our shields shall be not cast away
In deeds we will prove our Valour
Valour Valour
Valour Valour
The Valour of the Hellenic Blood
Fighting side by side
Closing all the ranks
Marching on Smashing On
No mercy for the foes
Sons of Heracles
Blessed by the Gods
Bravest men of all
Always fighting full of Valour
Valour Valour Valour
The Valour of the Hellenic Blood
Three hundred heroes into glory ride
They fight with courage no one will survive
The morning sun is sad the morning light
Will we see it again Leonidas is leading us
Ooh can you see the sparkle of his crest
In this day of despair in the search for victory
Across the Pass we stand surrounded everywhere
Hellas needs our blood a Martyr for this war
Brave mighty warriors
In battle blood we bring
Death is what we seek to find Glory and Victory
The sun is full of sadness we are going to die
Our weapon is our courage no regard for life
The Noble blood of Sparta falling one by one
Is this the last goodbye
Sparta is calling us
Victorious with my shield or dead upon it
I will return to my Land
Thanatos is my fate
Oh cry Hellas cry
your king has gone to die
Three hundred heroes into Glory ride
They fight with courage no one will survive
Oh cry Hellas cry
Leonidas's sacrifice
Wait for the final stand
there's a lion in my Heart
We're not afraid to die
there is Victory in my death
Wait for the final attack
Fight tooth and nail
all is lost
We march off to war
Be strong we will die
We fight to the last
Be fierce as we die
We march off to war
Be strong we will die
We fight to the last
Be fierce as we die
In the foray of the fight
A sweet whisper ascends into the sky
Is the whisper from the Martyr
Who will rise again no more
His soul's ascending into the sky
He's a fierce foe on the battlefield
Defeated on the Pass now he's dead now he's dead
But his glory will be eternal
Of Noble origin his birth
And Noble his spirit
Dressed by Courage and Honour
Pride his daily bread
I was born to die on the battlefield
A life so short destined to find
The Glory and the Victory
Through the ages and pages of History
On a green mantle of spring
His body lies
Red hair soiled by blood
Sweat on him dripping pain
Trampled down by friends and foes
'Till the end of this brutal fight
Sparta
Can you hear my voice
Can you hear my cry
Can you hear my breath
Sparta
Can you hear my call
Can you see my fate
Can you hear my name in the wind
An army of three hundred men
will arrive
Will try to defend our Mighty Homeland
Leonidas will come for the final stand
Taking the final steps
Entering life
A life of mysteries never to be seen
Struggling for survival
Then the silence is back
Leaving the flesh
Why is my world created this way
Empty existence
I wish the void no more
My weak cry sounding deep down from below
A sound of another world so fragile
I'm telling a story of a destiny
So devastating my soul can not rest
Murdered by the womb in cold blood
Shame forcing the mind and the will
A crime above all crimes
Never baptized nor nursed
My vengeance will strike hard
All sinners must pay the price
Blood of their own blood
Mother descending down to hell
Please give me a name
Please give me my peace
Bury my body
Deep down in the dark soil to rest
Unwanted left alone
Starving rotting screaming
Until the silence comes
Leaving the flesh
Where's the drink of life
Help me to find the well
Blood from the core
Lifeblood turns to death
Please give me a name
Please give me my peace
Bury my body
Deep down in the dark soil to rest
Say my name
Please save my soul
Bury me
In the dark soil to rest
Loved by all he was
Protected by the oath of no harm nor death
Dreams of fright haunting at night
He saw his own demise
The one eyed god he has forseen 
The loss of truth the loss of light
The end of all is coming soon
The one eyed god now he knew 
Mother of concern casting a spell of protection
Immortal now he is
Fire water and stone on his side
A blind arrow piercing his heart
The world will fall with the truth and the light
The death of Balder his ride down to Hel
Goddess of the underworld Hel please release him
The loss of truth the loss of life
The long winter is coming soon 
A wind blows through the trees
The moon shines through the clouds
The black Nordic sky brings sorrow
It's so cold and darker than before
The snow is raging down
Covering all signs of life
The birds are gone
Only shadows remains
Silence sweeps out over this frozen land
A tragic curse lies here
The cold black winter over forsaken fields
Nothing can disperse it
The sun can not be seen no more
In ages it's gone behind dark clouds
A tragic cure lies her the cold black winter
Over forsaken fields lasting until the end
The time of the Axe is here
The time of the Final War is here
Fimbul winter is coming upon us
Followed by winter and winter again
Brothers fighting against their own
So is the prophecy told by Odin up high
The time of the Axe is here
The time of the Final War is here
The Ground will burst and unleash the wolf
With his jaws open wide devouring all
The snake from the see is crawling up on land
See the blade of fire from Muspelheim
The time of the Axe is here
The time of the Final War is here
The sound of Heimdals horn over the lands
The time has come the time of the wolf
Gods awaken by the sound of the horn
Beasts against gods blood and steel
Apples of Idun falls with them all will fall
The dagger of shadows deceiver's blade
Silence is spread all is lost
Lost in the annals of time long past over
Deep in soil shallow and unkempt
Brothers and sisters in ground hallowed sacred
Their blood this earth we will consecrate
Their eyes once boiling with life
Their hearts bursting with passion
With dreams they carried forever
Through days that promised the world
Then came the black winds burning
The beasts with fire in their hands
The execution squads surrounding
And their children in pieces at their feet
and who stood watching
From El Mozote to Amritsar
From Nanking to My Lai
From Srebrenica to Algiers
From Wounded Knee to SabraShatila
From Tiananmen to East Timor
From Warsaw to Darfur
From Guernica to Halabja
Their spirit lives in defiance of it all
Graves of our fathers vanquished
Entombed in their furrowed prisons
Soldiers programmed show no mercy
and the world stood watching
Regret nausea and rage
Never Again was the phrase
Lest not our conscience we betray
as we stand passive in our guilt
Choked by the hidden hand of God
What eyes have seen the world
From wellworn knees
Where corpses lay at soldier's feet
Conquistadors  God Speed
The Prophet and the angel
Inside his oval lair
She whispers to his empty head
Conquistador war is peace
We'll trample stomp and segregate them
Conquistador why would I lie
Have another drink of wine
Toast it to the terrorist
You're brothers in each other's arms
Doppelganger's in distress
The clash of the fools he arrives
Blinded and faithmartyred
Cleansed and reborn
In the shadow of the crescent moon
The crucifix shines in its petrol graveyard
In what God's name shall they rule
the Cowboy and Caliphate in love with each other
Then appearing if by magic in freightlined bins
Things upon blessed things
In idolatry where death is worshiped
Now what did God say in that old testament
And what about those workers in exotic Chinaland
It does not apply to those heathen abroad
As long as they slave I'll have them to thank 
It's more cash in hand to spend at the mall
Woe to the children of God
O Suffer thy misguided ways
You're sold
Looking in from the outside
Each city pukes its wounded forth
A world that time forgot
Along 95 from south to north
From gray to greener lands
To exburb suburb inbetween
Some choke and some breathe
A fact of life in this plutocracy
As the best of the worst plan our lives
Brother wave your trust in faith goodbye
So this is the ideal system 
Millions shunned in urban tombs
Easy for the rich to suffer
As they smile wave and lock their doors
Driving away from the failures
So trivial and so normalized
Back to their pristine pastures
To forward and secure their perfect lives
This nation bloodbound with its ties
Flood pouring gates open wide
Ghosts in concrete veils haunt Katrina's winds
Gasp as charcoal air fills lungs as black as tar
And they drown
Outside your gated homes
The world begins where your street ends
Yet in time your demons will come crawling back
Praise God for what you have in life
A nightmare in three dimensions
This opulence embraced by man
Reapers of the peasant's harvest
Gorging on the fat of the land
Caged in worldly mansions
Picking vassals out from the poor
Worship at the altar of avarice
Where Bourgeois man is born
As dead men walking spoiled earth
Who spend their shining coffers dry
With thirst never quenched nor quelled
You ever think to question why
Outside your window of comfort
It's like night of the living dead
For each dime you bleed from another
The stench of your poverty spreads
Defining the world in equations
Commodity prices and fees
You see other humans as cattle
To service the gluttonous beast
A werewolf's banquet
Of ostentatious parody
Masquerading fortunes
Amassed through servility
As you eat them alive now meet your slaves
Gomorrah caving in on your precious homes
Four walls falling fast
Burning time the specters of a past life lived
Another year to wallow in the bitterness of loss
Recast into this languid mold
Back to a state of Thermidor
Entranced by the reminiscence haunt
But what could have been now is gone
Demons breeding demons in my head
Is this how the book of life ends
Dead drunk dejected and unsung
Left with no purpose but to grieve
And far are the cosmos that twist and unwind
A lefthanded path into the black
As youth dissolves quickly and tensions divide
I stand frozen on that day I left
The stare of Medusa the death in my eyes
Numbing reflections from senses deprived
Walking out onto streets of blight and misery
Where strangers glance then quickly look away
With eyes that speak a thousand words in one
From weathered faces lined with years of pain
Reliving each act in hollowed atrophy
Tasting pleasures of the flesh in absence
These countless ways we sacrifice and lose
Doom
Born under black skies with no expectations
Awaiting resurrection the great unwashed seethe
Is this the present
Can we call this life
And for the future utopian dystopian or death
Is this the present
Can we call this life
these dreams in the gutter unspent
Desire traded for dearth
And Hope for destitution
As eaters and eaten break bread
They learn their trades in time
But the teacher must be taught just as well
And as such this tragedy unfolds
we never asked for
One small step into life and your taken
Taken by a storm of fear
You can't stop the fleeting of the years
A reflection of inert violence
In my million dollar box of regret
I'll spread disease to protect it
My reality is life in the backseat
Heed the call of the Suicide Shepard
When they jump I know I'll follow
Proclaiming your opinions law
As your average American always doing all I can
Forgiveness was my greatest sin
So I took a knife to my pity
To the people in black city
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Truth chooses the strangest words
Not the tongue of the common herd
So take a blade let it bleed
Fuck the people in black city
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
I was a brazen prince and cold
Now a king on an oaken throne
These dark ages mean nothing to me
For I have forsaken black city
So never bow to any gods
Tame wolves are nothing but dogs
So take a blade let it bleed
To the people in black city
On a course to fight
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
To the heavens we take
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists
The thrill of the kill in the hunters chase
Brandish new force like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours
Subservient dogs
Crippled by the pack
Crawling in blind honour
Head down to be shot
Feel the new force like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours
You crawled in the dark
Blind faith broke you down
Face down in submission
Laying down to be shot
This dawn is ours to rise
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
Destruction force to strike
Clenched fists rise
From the dawn has arisen the hunter
The banishing force the new world dominator
This is retribution
 for all those who died
So come to me all you philosophers
I have a use for all your words
And as for poets and bards
Sycophants to every scar
Burn burn BURN
And as for you lovers of light
You are prisoners on all sides
Burn burn BURN
And as for you humanists
I give the gift of pestilence
Burn burn BURN
This is Tyranny
This is Retribution
 for all those who died
And as for your politics
You march in circles with semantic tricks
Traitors
And as for you occultists
You hide in shadows with your books
And fuck you all religious fools
Your gods your temples your fucking rules
Burn burn BURN
I have no need for pessimism
I believe in Nihilism
Burn burn BURN
Spare none the blade
Spare none the fucking blade
This is Tyranny
This is Retribution
For all those who died
From those who lied
And emperors of golden halls
You built your tomb within your walls
Burn burn BURN
So blessed be the murderers
Who work like wicked conjurers
Thrown into the fire
Spare none the blade
Spare none the fucking blade
Rape the world
God is dead
Praise hail Satan
Cross has dread
Will to power
Victory is one
Satan has rise
Phallus demons break
Jet black fire
Evil they make
Victory is one
Decimation on command
One word  ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK
Decimation on command
One words  ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK
God is dead
World is burning
People die in plague
Victory to the grave
Victory is one
Ride forth sons of perdition
Dominate fuck and destroy
By blood and thunder  rise of the heretics
Satan has won
Stealth it rapes
Black shark takes
Dark war awake
Victory is one
Sons of perdition
Inseminate
Wolf kult religion
Victory is one
Ride forth sons of perdition
Dominate fuck and destroy
By blood and thunder  rise of the heretics
Satan has won
They came to her house in the dead of night
They came to take her
Her mother screamed and her father cried
Let them take her
So the poor little bitch is taken as a witch
To the dungeon
There she is stripped and beaten with a whip
Then they raped her
And she liked it
So this is how you fuck with a crucifix
The poor little bitch well she likes it
So they held her down while they took their turn
They had to break her
Said she was evil and she would burn
Then they raped her
So why does this tale turn you on
Why does it excite you
Cos we are beasts like the beasts in the wild
Or more like barnyard pigs
And you like it
Gather 'round all you firestarters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come sons of Remus
The beast now calls
Wolf sire children
Daughters of Rome  come
Gather 'round all you fire starters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come sons of Remus
The beast now calls
Wolf sire children
Daughters of Rome  come
Come all you mountain lions
Come to our mountain fire
Come and heed the call
We are what you're looking for
Come all you wild wolves
Women with sharpened claws
Come to our mountain fire
We have what you're looking for
Yes you are what we're looking for
Gather 'round all you firestarters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come to our mountain hall
Come and heed the call
Come all you immoral seizers
Fire starters and whirlwind reapers
To the victor the spoils
Outside  War The ruthless slay
Basking in horrors as my tyranny reigns
But even now I can't resist
Pounding bone with my studded fist
Dawn brings promise but I was cursed at birth
To rule or die like a storm upon this earth
As a mercenary first I came to be
Then the armies hailed and bowed to me
Wolf serpent ritual fire
Blackens the skies like a fucking pyre
Behold my banner kneel to me
Behold my banner my legions see
Cruel undead relentless beast
Animal now as always been
For some are born with the curse
Wolf serpent ritual fire
Chokes the skies like a blackened pyre
Witch hunter  seeks a scapegoat
Witch hunter  words blow in the wind
Witch hunter  seeks a way out
Witch hunter  know all that is sin
Witch hunter  herald of plagues
Witch hunter  would kill to morality's name
Witch hunter  the virulent keep
The lies of pigs and their fucking disease
There are those who will come to watch you die
To stand around your funeral pyre
The first to cry and the first to fall
The first to come to the witch hunter's call
The first to curse whatever is free
The first to fight and the first to flee
The first to do whatever is done
The first to sing the witch hunter's song
And yea tho' you walk in the shadow of self
Do not be afraid if you find it is hell
Do not be a slave to just what has been
To make the virtue of demons is the ultimate sin
So fear not my friends for the hour draws near
Though the old may be wise
No strength to they wield
They envy the young
For by life not death they are killed
Woe to the city of blood
Where murder rushes in like a flood
Completely full of pillage and lies
Where prey never escape alive
The cracking of the whip
The rattling of the wheel
Galloping horses blood on steel
Horsemen charging forward
Swords flashing spears gleaming
Slain bodies steaming
A mass of corpses endless in sight
Horsemen stumble over the lifeless
Destroyed with overwhelming might
Because of the many acts of prostitution
Nineveh brought destruction on herself
Charming and wellfavored one
I will throw filth on you
Make you vile and treat you with contempt
You shall become a spectacle
You too Nineveh
Will become drunk with the cup of Gods wrath
You too Nineveh
Will search in vain for a rescue from the enemy
Your fortresses are nothing
Your people are weak
The gates of your land are opened wide
The fire will devour you
Multiply yourself like the creeping locust
Multiply yourself like the ones that swarm
Your shepherds are asleep
Your nobles are lying down in death
Your people are scattered on the mountains
And there is no one to gather them
There is no relief or healing in sight for you
Incurable is your wound
All who hear the news
Rejoice at your demise
Surrounded by principalities and powers
Entrenched deep in desert lands
Wickedness resides in supernatural realms 
Sifting lives like the falling sands 
Ideological displeasure
Hatred of Christ is manifest
I refuse to renounce my God
Behold my faiths final test
Prepare the blades
Herded to the shore
Revealed to eyes of the world
This shell will soon be no more
Surrounded by principalities and powers
Entrenched deep in desert lands
Wickedness resides in supernatural realms 
Sifting lives like the falling sands 
Ocular disparagement
Execution imminent
Line us up one by one
Forced to my knees I cannot run
I cease not speaking Yeshuas name
The name by which salvation comes
No other name is given under the heavenly realms
And there is salvation in no one else 
Extremist militant mind
Starting to slice
The spurting of blood
Lacerating the skin revealing the organs within
Off with my head
Behold the scroll
Under the Altar of Souls
Of my God
Holy and true
He is Lord
He is God
Almighty
For all time 
Cursed ancient one you slithering snake
Trails in the sand and dirt you will make
Eat the dust your sustenance made
For your deception the price you've paid
The ageold falsehood by lies to ensnare
With forked tongue tasting the air
Precision strike the venom inject
Years of mendacity ways to infect
Equivocation untruths are told
Beguiling the masses a concept of old
Jealousy to God your plan of condemnation
Entice humankind with multitude temptation
Your crafty ways the plan to deceive
That day in the Garden when spoken to Eve
Jesus took it all the Lamb who was slain
His payment on the cross body wracked with pain
Death could not hold Him divine resurrection
Took the keys of death  hell sin disconnection
Doomed to destruction your fate has been sealed
When Christ returns His glory revealed
Crush the head of the serpent
Lucifer you better run Run
He's coming He's coming
It is finished
Supreme awareness reign for all eternity
Understanding insight Maker of Infinity
Where will you go when you run from God
What place can you find
He is allseeing and allknowing
Searching the heart and mind
Intelligence beyond human comprehension
Bring forth compassion eternal lifeextension
Encompassing consciousness
Word was made flesh
Jesus Christ the only begotten Scion of One
Brings forth compassion
Eternal life through the Son
The universe expands by the breath of His word
Majestic Creator not of this world
Like a thief the Great Day is near
Deafening roar the heavens disappear
Conflagration the elements destroyed
Earth is stripped completely lifedevoid
Behold the fire
Great will be the destruction
But God keeps His word
A place where righteousness dwells
A new Heaven and new Earth
Since creation life will persist
But by His word the heavens and earth exist
He's patient with you His promise not delayed
let me out of prison
I'm just killing time
every time I turn around
I start to hear familiar sound
counting down as time stands still

Old enough to know better too young to care
Bent of selfdestruction going nowhere
If I had a reason I could make it work for me
If I had an answer I wouldn't be so hard to see
Feelin' all just the same
Feelin' all like a pain
No I'm not down the drain
Make my own decisions just to go away
Take the consequences just not today
Got enough reasons still not workin' for me
Got all the answers still so hard to see
Somethin' is confusin' me
Somethin' is abusin' me
Somethin' is refusin' me life
Let me live
nothing to fight for
I wanna give
nothing to cry for
Take me there
nothing to lie for
I don't care where
nothing to die for
And show me why there's nothin' to die for too
Old enough to know better too dead to change
Went in with a full deck goin' out deranged
I had all the answers I was too blind to see
Mirror man in my eye
Mirror man gonna cry
Mirror man make you die
Let me live
nothing to fight for
I wanna give
nothing to cry for
Take me there
nothing to lie for
I don't care where
nothing to die for
And show me why there's nothin' to die for too
standin' at the crossroads
which way you gonna go
and what you gonna do
when it comes
bargainin' a gasoline
take a ride on this machine
gonna get me some
when it comes
just how far you gonna go
somebody should let you know
once you're in you ain't get it out
put aside your foolish pride
so you take just one more ride
I don't think you know
what it's about
here it comes
ridin' on a livin hell
got another soul to sell
right is right and wrong is wrong
life's a dream
on this machine
and lasts just about as long
so ya think you know it all
and when you ride you never fall
well I got some news for you
entice you with a wicked smile
take a ride for a while
seems that the news is true
yes it's true
oh take me away
on the ride of your life
oh put me away
deathpusher
last time of my life
skullkrusher
ten thousand nightmares
ten thousand years
ten thousand martyrs crying
ten million tears
all the thinking never done
all the murder all the fun
wash the blood from your hands
bury your secrets in the sand
and forget
your mouth gonna dry
shortness of breath
symptoms of fear
symptoms of death
tracks go on for miles
through the agony and smiles
layin' there in pieces on the ground
what the hell you take a chance
crusher calls make your stance
when you're dead you never make a stand
race with the devil
engine's slowin' down
fifty years too early
you're laying underground you're crushed
you're killing me your mouth is movin'
but I cannot hear you speak
life's a tragedy go on livin'
in a world not for the weak
keep your dreams inside your heart
never let the pressure tear you apart
truth is whispered on a breath
loud enough to cover the smell of death
never thought too important to mention
livin' through the birth the birth of tension
never thought too important to mention
livin' with the tension tension tension
don't you understand too much tension snap
where you lose your grip
too many demands start at birth snap
from the bomb you're ripped
leave your dreams inside behind
never had a reason that you'll never find
tension builds another way
gonna make you all go away
too much tension all around
too much tension bring you down
all the pressures in the narrow mind
all the reasons you'll never find
did you kill your father sleep with your mother
idolize your sister jealous your brother
did ya kick the dog were you beat a strap
were you really be abused were you fakin'
all that too tense
you're killin' me so many ways
so little time to think
life's catastrophe my glass empty
and I really need a drink
movin' all so very quick
movin' so fast that it makes me sick
let me outta here
who tends the fire
who keeps the torches lit
who fills your eyes with smoke
so you can't see
I need the fire
I need the torches lit
to see through all the smoke covering me
I have seen the fires burning
burning through the night
I have watched the tides a turning
and they go from dark to light
what is this meaning
what does this writing mean
where do I go
what do I do for now
prophecies are foolish
they never last
they never speak the truth
so why are they calling me now
I don't know cause I cannot see
all I'm sure is gotta be
I'm not sure that I'm even me
but I know that I gotta be
yes I know that you're gonna die
birth life death is the reason why
save those fears that you're gonna cry
cause I know that you're gonna die
yes I know I cannot see
and I'm sure that I gotta be
all these voices are killin' me
but they say that I got
say that I got
say that I gotta be me
who tends the fire
who keeps the torches lit
who fill your eyes with smoke
so you can't see
I need the fire
I need the torches lit to see
out on this road takes its toll
and you pay for everything you do
underlights made me blind
this place is the same as last night
out of control takes its toll
but you learn to live with your dreams
speaking your mind to those you find
listening to what you have to say
I wouldn't change the way
I wouldn't stop the decay
promised the world as your world
changed before your eyes
and the days became the weeks
and the weeks the years
and no one remembers that very first day
or how it slipped away
forever I wait pulling in pulling out
as the motors whine
to remind me I'm home
and I'm here to stay
as we decay
another day
decay away
I'm goin' home I don't know where
I'm goin' home not far from here
out on this road paint this toll
make me whole set the stage
fill it with anger fill it with rage
no I don't know what's today
I know it falls in the years of decay
self sacrifice everynight
and together we paid a price in blood
that spilled out through the years
and another day passes away
look to the black drawn farther back
look to each day see the decay
times I've had good and bad
win or lose this is what I choose
revenge is sweet for thouse who wait
never early always late
waiting now to consummate
a marriage made in hell
hand in hand walk alone
as good advice seems to drone
evil cuts right to the bone
has it come awakens me
is it done and will it ever die
will it go taking me
don't you know
evil never dies
keep me close to your heart
adversity will come apart
and finish just before you start
never question why
today was then remember when
skipping numbers one through ten
permanence through the pen
read the rights a prophet's word
I've learned to deal with the absurd
and reach a darkened
pinnacle of light
money hungry power thirsty
penny piching fear inflicting
double crossing back stabbing
promising eternity for a price
suckin' brain washing
mind raping soul stealing
constant preaching salvation reaching
lowest form of human fucking life
evil never dies
laughter stands accusing me
emotion stands abusing me
the battered and the bruising me
is there darkness when you die
I heard a sound no one there
I heard a shot no one cares
laughter turns into despair
evil hidden everywhere
evil has a chilling stare
null and void of any care
is where the answer lies
it does no good to beg or cry
it does no good to question why
it does no good it never dies
evil never dies
I'm looking through a hole in the sky
I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I'm getting closer to the end of the line
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine
I'm living in a room without any view
I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head
Hole in the sky take me to heaven
Window in time through it I fly
I've seen the stars disappear in the sun
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars
I don't believe there's any future in cause
Hole in the sky take me to heaven
Window in time through it I fly
Yeah
I've seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
Why do you treat yourself like that 
I have a question I need a response
No 
This faith of yours will seal my life 
And you promised not to scorch the skies
This faith of yours has sealed my life
You're a child of your own demise
I've seen the face the author of my faith
With my blade I'll sever the strings of fate
The rebellious axe of man cuts you to your knees
These games you play gamble the minds of man
Man is consumed with majestic swirling light 
I've had a vision of a life without jealous gods
With the fury of a broken soul I plan to 
Burn down towers that dwell in front of me
Through my eyes I will see the fading of kings
Beneath your throne I wait for battle unseen
3 mad gods will frantically search for a cause
With the sunrise I'll act on my words of deceit
The head of gods will be burned in the streets
Sending mankind into a world that's unknown
My mind will finally be freed
In the war over minds my furies lost
I am left a souless shallow void
My heart is a blackened pile of ash
I can't fight my way out of this
3 beasts who share one mind have claimed me
As I rise from the ashes 
Through the celestial sea
An empyreal light calls 
And provides the vision I need
I'm enguilted by a presence I cannot see
My senses are heightened to a world unseen
There is nothing left the time has come to leave
Make your way to the altar of hyperboles
Deep in a chamber surrounded by bones 
Shrouded in mystery could this be the key 
The smell of sulfur and death is comforting me
As I descend into darkness I see a light 
I reach out to touch it a mysterious sight
This can't be real I saw them die
3 odd beasts this must be a lie
I take my blade thrust it deep inside 
As I tear through bones bloodlust excites
I'm ending this quest
My journeys over I've lain to rest all my foes
This raging pain is out of my life 
Like a priest with no God
You noble seekers made a mistake
But my head is clear and you're still gone 
The end of your life will be erased 
You're gone 
As I carve my way to the valley floor
My eyes are fixed on the serpent's soul
Across the valley I see a mountain peak
This is the path to seal the serprnt's fate
I take in all that surrounds me
This land has claimed many bodies
My blade leads me through the valley
The stench of the serpent's breath surronds me
Across the twisted maze of fire
I can feel the stare of a thousand eyes
The winds starts howling
The sun disappears
As I make my way to the shore
I unsheathe my blade preparing for war
Up the mountain and into the cave
Colossal creatures won't stand in my way
I hack my way through a sea of bodies
My eyes are set on the stairs above me
I march on
A glowing light is all I have to guide my way
This serpent's soul I'll slay
I march on
It's getting close
I can gear its call
And its heart beats louder
Echoing through the halls
As I round a corner and come face to face
The serpent cowers and I hold my place
I take my blade and starts to hack
As the serpent squirms the sky turns black
With a flash of light the place goes dark
The reign of gods has ended I've made my mark
He burst through the door blood fills his hands
Exclaims the black storm is coming
It's time to pay for our past
Run fight hide it's no use
Run fight hide it's no use
Don't let that beast gaze in your eyes
I can hear her coming as she purges the land
The goddess of pain can't be stopped 
She leaves bodies in ashes 
Entire cities crushed in the palm of her hand
Run fight hide it's no use
Run fight hide it's no use
Don't let that beast gaze in your eyes
She's coming to get you like it or not
I'd say a prayer for you 
But what's the point when you're dead
Goddess of pain I beg you
Deliver a fast blow
I'd say a prayer for you 
But what's the point when you're dead
Goddess of pain I beg you
I keep deep inside of me
You can swim with the masses that's OK
But don't count on me
So long I've tried
Out of control we're only a bit too loud
But that will hurt noone
Let's start the show
If you're not in it
You'll never understand it
The calling
That tempts me so much
Tonight we're going to change the hands of time
Is it hard to see
What this means to me
This is my gate to hide and to be free
Take a look from the distance
See dreams burned to ashes
Searching for something to be proud of
At the end of the day
Tonight is the night
Reviving the gods inside you
They are all asleep
I can hear you scream let's breaking the silence
Like so many times before
Gazing starlight the full moon is rising
The book of fate dreams and forgotten
Tales is reopen once more
Long for mercy while I've walked
Through the ages leave centuries behind me
See that freedom has a meaning for me
Come on howling with me
Close your eyes
Glance at paradise
I saw Atlantis rising
Take your chance
Life is a fairytale
Be not just one of a kind
Free your mind
Reaching for ever life
Don't you follow the blind
Take your choice
Dive into the mystery
Take a deep breath of life
Path forlorn long and winding before me
Find me walking on the wind
The horizon is telling me I'm near
Eternity is just a heartbeat away
Won't you take a trip with me
There's a million ways behind me
Still a million ways to go
Where it starts I can't remember
Where it ends I'll never know
Find that moment try to capture it
And this is how it's meant to be
Let's draw up the curtains
Spotlight hits the stage
You'll be welcome to the show
Watch the tales of madness
Listen tales of hate
It's all been shown to you tonight
Give me your advice
I'm living in a world of lies
A place of disgrace
Once we have to pay the price
Don't close your eyes
Watching the raven's flight
Release your mind
There must be more to find
Don't watching for a guiding light
Start now changing minds
Join a world of constant fear
Live form species disappear
Where is your final destination
Headline news hear what they say
Desperation makes the day
Look at the evolutions crown
Don't waiting for a guiding light
Start now changing minds
The vision of a better world
Starts with me and you
Now you know the time has come
More things to be done
Fight your fear and turn the key
Create your destiny
How many minutes has the light
If you be waiting for the night
To break the seventh seal
We celebrate a show tonight
The energy it gives to me
The ignorant will never understand
Tearing up the gate to Promised Land
What's been suppressed for so long
It's rising today
There's just one thing you should know
Listen
Nights children Break silence
Go through Hold up your irons
One nation Creation
I've found my inspiration
My heart is pounding can't you see
The lights are flashing in my eyes
A serenade of steel
Hoping all wishes to be real
Believe in miracles today
I know this time we'll find a way
Ignite a fire that will never end
Light up the stairway to the sky
The edge of infinity
Join this magic carpet ride
Seizing the day
There's a place we call Earth
A paradise lost
Almost Eden before we all exist
Loot the planet and what all live on it
Its subjection brutality
No more trust Hope is lost
Society is sick
Realise it's the price we have to pay
See the road now has come to an end
No solutions no time to spend
Time to see what we have done
Time to realise what has begun
Mother Earth exploited and raped
Stop destroying of paradise
Kill Steal Lie  Till' all beauty has died
Cheat Fool Heap  We are living in golden chains
See the cradle of filth
We're parasite like
Sucking off all the energies of life
Greed and envy are real Human scourges
Slaves of our own reality
Stop the madness
Find back to the things
We have lost on that long and winding road
It's not easy but possible
Let's work together and we will win
Find myself lost in misery
Days gonna fade into grey
Daydreams imprison me there's no way out
Your scent is still everywhere
I try to hide from the past
God must be hating me
Life chews me up and spits me out
I wonder if the sun will ever shine on me
It's so hard to face the truth I can't deny
Embracing emptiness I've lost my strength at all
Only the pain inside me proves me I'm alive
Come on save me
Come on save me
Before I'm falling
Come on save me
Come on save me
Before it's too late
Echoes are whispering voices from the past
Never thought eternal love could hurt so bad
Corroded by emptiness these walls are closing in
My heart is bleeding
I'm afraid my wounds they will not heal
Beyond my visions lies the fright
It's turning all my senses
Inside my wishes ocean wide
There is a place to hide to
And on the edge of time
I saw the future sign
I looked at all the answers
Twilight misery
And on the edge of time
I saw the secret sign
I have heard the anthem calling
Lead by history
I fell into a vision of the end
I promise my friend we'll change it
I am still here to face the fear
To find my piece of heaven
Remind the past we would recall
A promise for the future
Mirror mirror on the wall
You're the one that shows it all
Can you tell me what's the meaning
Food for oil became oil for blood
A little different as they're told
Look at the ruins down my feet
Noone warned us when we went
To bring the peace to foreign lands
All hope now is buried in the sand
Eden's never been so far away
Seems out of reach
We have never been so many
But we never felt so alone
We cry for love
We cry for mercy
They talked of honour they talked of pride
Never thought so many died
We've learned the hard way that they all lie
Fear at night I shed a tear
The cries still linger in my ears
The dreadful sights won't disappear
Can't close my eyes can't fall asleep
The fallen ones wont let me go
Their screams are echoes here forever
Eye for an eye till all been blind
No peace of mind no hope to find
So welcome back on Devils playground
A mighty king a fortress build
To save his life and gold
By Daedalus plans the labyrinth was done
So he comes and with him his son
A trap great of stone to hold everyone
Minos laughs I've got to say this
No I cant let you go
There's so much you know
Arrested you'll be
No daylight to see
Deep down in the dark no ray of light
They made plans to hide
To build them wings like birds
To fly away from tyrants hands
Don't fly too high up to the sky
Sun burns your wings and you will die
Don't fly too high up to the sky
Sun burns your wings and you will die
No I cant let you go
There's so much you know
Arrested you'll be
No daylight to see
I see you rise
I see you rise
I see you rise
You fly you can touch the sky
I see you rise
I am riding the wind across the oceans
Hiding over the seas noone can hold me now
Father look at me why can't you see
We could almost be gods
Come and follow me
I see you rise
You thought you can touch the sky
I see you rise
Over and over again
I see you rise
You thought you can touch the sky
I see you rise
Son why don't you listen return to my side
Father please help me I was a fool
Look what's happening to me
I don't want to die
Rise so high try to touch the sky
Ever thought that you could fall
Rise so high try to touch the sky
Never thought that you could fall
Now now it's the time to say farewell my son
I'm here all alone my heart filled with pain
I know its the end of all our dreams
You left me to stay gods what a day
Oh I wish you back right here in my arms
Light brings back the pain
I cant escape It's too late
All that's left is just the pain inside of me
In my dreams I can see you fly again son
I hear the lament of the wind
In my dreams I see you fly again son
You were my light but now you're gone
Now you're gone
Feel the oceans breeze the wind in my hair
The agony hurts deep inside
If I could turn back time this time I would
You did had no chance to be what you could
Oh life is unfair no justice at all
In clouded minds where hate and anger collide
Then the secret of my inner self will reveal
I see tears in your eyes
I sense weakness inside
I will take you far away
To the deepest of your dreams
Let me in on your stream
To the entrance of your deep
I watched in disbelief
Imprisoned in a deadly maze
The enemy rise from within
Risking their lives on a dangerous search
With conspiracy in mind
Taste the hate within
Human weakness
A solution to the mystery
With conspiracy in mind
Now hear my warning
All you sinners on the porch
Sweet relief from the pain of longing
Remember this twisting smile
Unspeakable anguish
Heaven's out of reach
When mother nature will surely
Descend and sleep for eternity
Please release the weight
That lies on my shoulders
Please release the weight
That lies on my shoulders
I spiral into a grand illusion
In a world of reality beyond
I see tears in your eyes
Always out of reach
I want to sleep for eternity
I see tears in your eyes
I sense weakness inside
I will take you far away
To the deepest of your dreams
Let me in on your stream
To the entrance of your deep
I watched in disbelief
Imprisoned in a deadly maze
The enemy rise from within
Risking their lives on a dangerous search
With conspiracy in mind
Taste the hate within
Human weakness
A solution to the mystery
With conspiracy in mind
Always in a state of evolution
Some people try to differ from one another
To beat life's quiz is not an easy task
Hot pepper produce an unpleasant pain
Yet fools come back to feel the burn
Are we lost in the garden of hypocrisy
Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point
Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point
All system lock down
Go to selfdestruct
All system lock down
Go to selfdestruct
Always in a state of evolution
Some people try to differ from one another
An unpleasant pain when we feel the burn
Leaders sit high as we live like worms
The circle is closed history reversed
All we have done for you to be
The world has become what we didn't see
It's time to rise there's no easy way out
Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point
Now we have formed a riot against the masses
Information lost before it reach the point
All system lock down
Go to selfdestruct
All system lock down
Go to selfdestruct
Always in a state of evolution
Some people try to differ from one another
An unpleasant pain when we feel the burn
Are we lost in the garden of hypocrisy
In the shadows that falls from the trees
Deep in the black lake don't dare to go near
Don't you dare to go near
Behind the door to the closet
Reflections in the mirror
Every sounds you hear at night
Hiding under your bed
They feed on our fear
Where all the creatures of the underworld lives
Never out in the light
Afraid to die in the morning light
Tale of a Dream weaver
Stories about a beautiful siren
With a song that fool's every man to follow
She lives deep in the lake
Raving along in the full moons light
Watching her children play
Fooling around in the dead of night
Be home by dawn
Walk in the obscure
In the silence of the night
Don't wake the sleeping child
A window of glory light
From deep within our dream
From dusk till dawn we can hear them ponder
In the night they come from deep within
Frozen to stone while asleep at night
The night awakens our fear
But were always saved by the morning light
They feed on our fear
I have seen their eyes
As lights that glows in the night
Hiding under my bed
Dream weaver
We ask is this the way Do we believe
No one's answering
A few words may be heard
Temptation within my head
Now I'm filling up inside
A snake sleeps by my side
Once it opened I climbed in
Communication  wondering
Once it opened I climbed in
Communication  wondering
Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
Blood flows in the pulse
Like liquid hate we fall as deep
In the network soil no one's wondering
Generations lost
Holy devastation to land
Guns and bullets won't work
Vaporize their souls
Our land slowly rots and decay
No pride left
Once it opened I climbed in
Communication  wondering
Once it opened I climbed in
Communication  wondering
Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
A few words may be heard
Temptation within my head
Now I'm filling up inside
A snake sleeps by my side
Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
Lost in the connection
Communication sublime
One hundred miles are not so far away
In spite the map of our world
A planet with so many good intensions
What can we do when we ask our self why we try
The winter is closing in
Invisible frost tears on my skin
Like in a fairy tale we fly away into the night
Like in a fairy tale we fly away into the night
My arms my arms
Growing strong by being alone
Knowing that you'll soon me home
Like in a fairy tale we fly into the night
What can we do when we ask our self why we try
The winter is closing in
Invisible frost tears on my skin
What can we do when we ask our self why we try
The winter is closing in
Invisible frost tears on my skin
Like in a fairy tale we fly away into the night
On the shadows line where whispers creep
From the world above to the world beneath
On waves of silver I dreamed of gold
And rang the mark where my shadow fall
Take away this illusion  hide all the lies
Show no more fear  rise with the tide
And a silent shore waits with silver sand
Divide the sun  reveal my desire
Take away this illusion  hide all the lies
Show no more fear  rise with the tide
With beauty before me beauty behind
The sun in the morning is the beauty I find
Where sky land and water reveals together
I lay my body down in the ocean forever
The seaweeds in the ocean shall be my deathbed
Untie my hands and let my spirit free
Should I die to forgive
As colors fly
Try not to live
And paint my skin
Be with me here
To wake me up
At the ocean we are free
It stops the time
She cast her fair body and long blond hair
And closed her hands around me
In our ocean bed
I'm caught up in this wet web she's spun
As eyes of the ocean watch our secret vow
The seaweeds in the ocean shall be my deathbed
A silent ocean line
Awaits with silver sand
To suffer when all hope is denied
Waged down by sorrow marked by grief
To suffer when all hope is denied
Waged down by sorrow marked by grief
A home in flames fathomless night
Seek shelter from pain I wish to forget
Feeding on the enemy with a clean shot
Deadly screams don't reveal your presence
It's hard to ignore the blackened debris
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Unthinkable days man against man
Fighting on plains streams of pitch and soil
Brother fights brother over poisoned water
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds silence grows
A word so tall brother we are close
A sleep so deep stance wounded ear
Unthinkable days man against man
Fighting on plains streams of pitch and soil
Brother fights brother over poisoned water
At the edge of the world man against man
Living on fear deadly screams can be heard
Seeking shelter from pain wishing to forget
 to forget
Then a strange light came from the north
And light went dark under heavy sky's
Then a strange light came from the north
And light went dark under heavy sky's
A strange light came from the north
And light went dark under heavy sky's
Then a strange light came from the north
And light went dark under heavy sky's
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Silence surrounds
A broken voice
Watch over yourself brother
Watch over yourself brother
Time has come to fight or die
Enter the arena coliseum of the beast
The hunter the hunted the carnage for the feast
Chapel in peril prey of the possessed
Harboring foes forgotten by all
Returning Babylon worship the whore
The finale in geneses sabotaged by war
Holy are the wicked into the white
Cast into purgatory all must face the light
Crucifix and serpentine
Condemned before the law
Domination of the anarch
Crucifix will fall
Armies approach the final gate
Gathered there to watch and wait
Their time has almost come to rise
The darkness grows to deadly size
Overwhelming evil force
Too late to stop their bitter course
Invaders conquer without a fight
Like plagues of blackness blocking light
Persecuted subservient to tyranny
Witness to thine own elegy
Execution of the deed
Unlamented sympathies
Assassins led by blasphemy
Buried without thine dignity
Dawning sky a day so dreary
Seeing faithful weak and weary
Wanting so much more than is had
To give up anything in trade
Temptation flirts about you
Reach out the gold ring could be yours
Leading to where no one can save you
The lust of excess brings you end
Unearthly voices choirs of the dead
Calling for mercy darkness rears its head
Evil is rising mortality condemned
Onward and onward to the living end
The choice is ours what will we do
No one will know just what to do
Will the infernal fires of hell
Entombed into the need to be
Venomous conquest darkens the world
Trails of lifeless carnage left behind
And in the end you pay the price with your soul
A frightening scream pierces the night
A deliverance of an oppressive plight
Terror engulfs satanic life
A suffering of eternal strife
From mortal fear in your life
A stand to fight no more wrong or right
The accuser will be judged by sanctity
Stricken by the curse of heavenly sin
Legions behold the final day
Allegiance to the end a blood feast at the hands
That wash themselves of their foretold decay
Laid down to die martyrs saints all will cry
Save us from this eternal stay
A call to arms by high command
None will try to make a stand
To battle back the cold caress
Of death possessed by wickedness
Embodied spirits let through the gate
No hope for life scarred by death and hate
No longer are the dogs held bay
A frightening scream pierces the night
A deliverance of an oppressive plight
Terror engulfs satanic life
A suffering of eternal strife
From mortal fear in your life
A stand to fight no more wrong or right
The accuser will be judged by sanctity
Astral guide in mercy comes
A seeker of the fortune
Heir to the throne
From the horn of plenty
I taste life alone
Memories soon disappear
Through the haze becomes the twilight
An omen for the future
The destination lies in sight
Even gods in their infinity
The immortals fall away
Sanctuaries uncertainty
Masterpieces turn to grey
In twilight I witness higher fall
Leaving from where they once belonged
Sands of time forgotten so quick
Ages pass as none regret
On their knees I see supreme
Fade into their mortal place
The ending of some passing dream
Genocide or higher race
Even gods in their infinity
The immortals fall away
Sanctuaries uncertainty
Masterpieces turn to grey
The mighty must now scrape and crawl
To keep from losing what was owned
Evolution mercy non betray
The gift of life arrives with death
Creation let to sentence lives
Declared exile ancients survive
Escape to heavens halls to wait
Poised to loose their touch of hate
Sands of time forgotten so quick
Ages pass as none regret
On their knees I see supreme
Fade into their mortal place
The ending of some passing dream
Genocide or higher race
Even gods in their infinity
The immortals fall away
Sanctuaries uncertainty
Masterpieces turn to grey
In twilight I witness higher fall
Leaving from where they once belonged
The mighty must now scrape and crawl
To keep from losing what was owned
Believing their all seeing vision
Saints of hell of desperate cries
A veil was placed across our brow
Anointed one and all to die
No Father Son or Holy Spirit
Nor defences from the foe
All are battered tortured shattered
Allegiance without death is woe
A veil was placed across our brow
Anointed one and all to die
For lust of life
Tides of blackness pull you toward it
Consuming within its doors
Both life and death
Estranged to nocturnal light
In search for what is known but lost by the time
And when you see the light of lights
Out of the corner of your eye
There and then you will be falling
For you must answer to your calling
Revolving on a never ending journey
A glimpse into the gateways of eternity
Led to the edge then pushed to falling
For you must answer to your calling
The conflict raises swift before you
Abominations of human life
As if you've seen it all before you
Join the celebrated strife
From somewhere deep beneath the surface
The calls of millions just fade away
Signalling their new traditions
Timeless honour the proud must pray
Submit to force
I will stand my ground to the bitter end
Submit to force
None deny me my right to die
Submit to force
Now the terror is real
Submit to force
Closer to fear than before
Holy light of dawn is coming
Prince of darkness now retires
The black cat eyed feline mistress
Chants by the cauldron's fire
Packs of human wolves are howling
Smell of blood is in the air
Banshee screams her hellish aria
Faithful souls beware
Projectiles of death falling from the sky
Destroying humanity
As the mist of darkness rots the lives
Evil's presence is seen
Tartarus is rising through the Earth
As darkness fills the world
Voices are howling through the air
But no one speaks a word
Mephistophelian boundaries trap the souls
Who walk the night alone
No tomorrow except for those
Who follow what they know
Plutonium children attack the world
With Lucifer at their helm
Ascending from the infernal empire
The spirits of doom take hold
The final day the final battle
The final judgement call
Bleeding souls of Armageddon
Bloodshed plagues us all
Blessed enough to see the light
Shining in the sky
Blind enough to walk the night
Tempting flames shall fly
Who's the one to save your life
And turn the night to day
Hidden in the magic darkness
Befriended by the night
Lies the war torn ravaged victim
Treason complete a new order arrives
Pain the trouble drone infests
Everlasting night befalls revolt
Loot the storehouse of the lamb
The lion will be
Damned to hell compulsion of the thief
Driven by greed tempered by force
Sweet evil tendencies the easy way out
Fallen soldiers bleeding their sins
Fearing death the cowards tremble
All so afraid to fight
Laying down their earthly treasures
Trading possessions for the light
Fighting back without fighting
The blood on them it flows from us
The slaughtering of the lamb
Insures the lion to be
Rising through the mist around me
Shackled to my vice
The stench of my own sins surround me
Deep inside I need to live
Feed the fires for now but remember all
Deceived by the whore to evil
Voices in my mind revolt
Telling me trust in nothing
Questions begin the answer
Believe in nothing the deceptions sure
Revealing that which has always been
Programmed but not forsaken
Listen not to the charlatan
Question all without regard
An empty ringing breaks the silence
A voice upon the astral wind
Tears upon the trusting face
Turn away while you still can
From the gaze of your temptation
Rebellion is upon our hands
Sacred breeding desecration

Welcome to the gallery of bleeding art
Where I create pain on the canvas of death
In this realm of mine the revenge can begin
In a blackened place within me
Where reason is eclipsed by rage
In edifice of inviolable justice
Where my vengeance is coming to life
In all the beautiful colours of affliction
There is no dawn in this blood red dream
Just an endless night of anguish supreme
No more lies will be told
I will make you suffer in my mind
When I have ripped out your tongue
No more lies will be written
A thousand deaths for you inside
When I have smashed your fingers into pieces
Each stroke of my brush
A condescending strike against you
Each dash of paint
A scar upon your body
An eternal monument of your worthless existence
In the darkness I can hear you weep
You can't wake up from this breathless sleep
Every image of your tormented face
Every depiction of your lacerated body
Every instant of your suffering
Is a grand piece of bleeding art
Live through a thousand torments
I don't feel the pain anymore
There is no life in this world of scorn
Just an endless night with tragedies adorned
No more lies will be told
I will make you suffer in my mind
When I have ripped out your tongue
No more lies will be written
A thousand deaths for you inside
When I have smashed your fingers into pieces
Death so close yet so far far away
My wrath is eternal I will never let you die
Because your suffering is keeping me alive
No more lies will be told
I will make you suffer in my mind
When I have ripped out your tongue
No more lies will be written
A thousand deaths for you inside
When I have smashed your fingers into pieces
In the dazzling white light we can no longer see
What we created  a one second triumph
Rivers of our finest plutonium
Melting into the ground like an open wound
Standing without the ability to
Behold our finest yet final creation
Mortal senses die in the light
Watching our masterpiece with dead eyes
They are blind
We are blind
Erasing parasites manmade extinction
Vanishing lifeforms manmade perfection
The time has come for our slithering existence
To return into the womb from which it came
Shattered flocks of ignorant beings
Blown away in a carnal thermonuclear storm
A onesecond holocaust
Realizing that they have realized
A ritual of massdestruction
Man made extinction  extinction made man
Killing for inner peace
Man made extinction  extinction made man
Ruling a world where all life has ceased
In the blackest of voids we can once again see
The uncreation  our absolute triumph
It is the dawn of the neogenesis
The rebirth of all that ever was
Standing with the ability to
Behold our finest yet final creation
Mortal senses die in the light
Watching our world with dead eyes
They are blind
We are blind
Recreate paradise  manmade creation
Exalted lifeforms  godlike  perfection
The time has come to be as one with the gods
To return into the womb from which we all came
Shattered flocks of ignorant beings
Blown away in a carnal thermonuclear storm
A onesecond holocaust
Realizing that they have realized
A ritual of massdestruction
Man made extinction  extinction made man
Killing for inner peace
Man made extinction  extinction made man
Ruling a world where all life has ceased
Man made extinction
Extinction made man
Trapped inside a world distorted
Thick air pounding pulse
Climbing dead walls seeking cure
Chemical solutions giving no relief
In this relentless circle
The spiral heading downwards
Chaos is closing in
Temporary solutions for a
Dislocated mind
Embrace the dawn they say
Daily escapism
And seek the light they say
Where the walls have already
Absorbed whatever rays there were
Patters seem unbreakable in this room of decay
The only wish is the wish to endure
This endless journey of selfcontempt
The sun is rising upon others
Laughter is echoing but not here
Only elsewhere
Truthful words and acts of deliverance
Every reason evident but not here
Only elsewhere
Trapped inside a mind dismantled
Hollow words echoing
The only wish is the wish to hate
Where the will to live equals the will to hate
Forlorn mind scorched and barren
Unbalanced led astray
Sixty nights past endurance
Consumed by this room where
Destruction has brough no life
Snuff the rebellion
Destroy the intruders
And seek the light they say
As if the light was not only
A fragmented memory of yesterday
Sun rising  but not here
Only elsewhere
Laughter echoing  but not here
Only elsewhere
The sun is rising upon others
Laughter is echoing but not here
Truthful words and acts of deliverance
Every reason evident but not here
Only elsewhere
Soon to be taken away
From this world that I once destroyed
Seconds feel like hours
As I return the time I took
Those I blessed with deepest hate
Were only drops in the ocean of blood
that cleansed my mind but left stains that I
Have not managed to was away from my hands
Epidemic yet healing parasites
Spawned in the chambers of spiritual genocide
Dead senses awaken as my body is injected away
Emotional intolerance
No one can provide the callous with fury
No emotions no forbidden thoughts
No strength
No emotions no forbidden thoughts
Not even death can kill this cancernow
The smile of the open wound
Is yearning to be free
It will only take seconds
To wipe away the vertigo inside me
Fear takes control
In this everlasting machinery
Body lays dormant
Festering spite in pale semblance
Those I blessed with deepest hate
were only tokens of my physical demise
Body is drained but a seed has been planted
That they have not managed to take away
No emotions no forbidden thoughts
No strength
No emotions no forbidden thoughts
Not even death can kill this cancernow
The parasite is holding me back
The disease erased my free will
Swept away by the comforting apathy
Not even death can kill this cancer
In my dreams at least I can kill myself
I am the fire that is burning in your eyes
A memory that never dies
In your raped and strangled mind
I am the performance
That is played in front of your eyes
A final disentaglement of your mind
But you are blind
Without the possibility to see
That you are the shadow of my pain and existence
Dying without any sign of resistance
Depredated you seethe with hatred
And despise my being
But what is left of your life
Only memories that are utterly repressed
Do you belong in this world
When you are the one who bleeds
Eternally
Realize  you are the one who bleeds
I'm alive  causing the pain you need
Realize  you are the one who bleeds
Sacrifice  freedom to be redeemed
Flesh  tainted with blasphemies
Death  seeking tranquillity
Pain  losing the inner war
Sacrifice your freedom to be redeemed
Visions  clinging to your mind
Feeding you with lies
Hatred  burning in your eyes
Revealing the open wounds
That were caused by the shards
From the mirror that you destroyed
In home to smother the memories
An act of desperation
For you are doomed
I am the shards 
Each one symbolising the pain and suffering
That you set in front of me
What is left of your life
Only memories that are utterly repressed
Do you belong in this world
When you are the one who bleeds
Eternally
In ignorance shaped to live suppressed
Devoured by a sheltering light
Obedient and restrained
Rejoicing in innocence
Indefagitable prayer for heavenly grace
In fear for the reckoning day
Praising a bastard
An unconditional devotion
To the unyielding one and his ways
Devoured by his protective rays
But as it was written
A bite so small enlightened all
Cognizance took the holy saviour's place
Greater than any revelation
Unyielding ways and values replaced
A gathering living to die no more
Abandoned light  delivering bite
A gathering dying to live reborn
Remoulded their vindictive crusade began
Blinded by wisdom they ran
Aggressive formations unleashed
Wrapped in cotton
Thriving victorious alive
The hour of triumph has come
Praise our wisdom now
Turn to intolerant choirs chanting the words
Praise our wisdom now
It is your way to freedom
Praise our wisdom now
Turn to beautiful theories consuming the earth
Praise our wisdom now
It is the only way
Through centuries of time imbalance in bloom
For those who defined freedom
Devoured by the sheltering truth
Obedience replaced by comforting nothingness
But with every yearning pleased confusion arose
Resistance began to grow
Where nothing is more or less true
A world beyond common knowledge
Greater than any revelation
Unyielding ways and values replaced
A gathering living to die no more
Comforting light  heavenly grace
A gathering dying to live reborn
Praise our ignorance
Turn to intolerant choirs changing the words
Praise our ignorance
It is your way to freedom
Praise our ignorance
Praise our ignorance
It is the only way
Praise our ignorance
It is your way to freedom
Looking down at the masses below
And the yearning for divine presence on earth
Caused rather the opposite
Crippled angel  a martyr with wings sawn off
Calling for vengeance
A dead saviour transformed into the great being
A guardian angel fallen from grace
A merciless smothering of any tendency
To break free from the cursed chains
Where every step forward is heading into
The arms of the being
Crippled angel
Welcoming every man too far away from the
World on fire that fell into oblivion
This journey will continue
Can't hide from the wretched being
Can't hide from the reality any more
Can't ignore the failure
Or that the downfall was unavoidable
Can't hide from the wretched being
Can't hide from reality any more
Can't ignore the stricken's chantings
Or heal the wounds that were selfinflicted
He has won
When a hundred years have passed
And the silence still remains
He will celebrate the victory of time
When the earth is dead and everything is cold
He will come back for more
Because in the ashes of yesterday's creations
There may still lie traces of hope
Walk in his footprints  settle for the earth
When time has stopped and all hope has gone
He has won
He will celebrate the victory of time
When the earth is dead and everything is cold
He will come back for more
Because in the ashes of yesterday's creations
There may still lie traces of hope
Walk in his footprints  settle for the earth
for he is your wicked superior
When everything is dead and there is no escape
And there is no tomorrow days that never came
The journey continues
Visionary  an angel with wings sawn off
Begging for mercy
Diminished  I am the shadow
Watching the slow uprise
I shall not stay nor shall my body
A timeless journey
Angellike voices are fading away
Buried in ashes so cold
Where there is no light
they took him away
he comes for me diety diety diety diety
diety
he comes for me
with respect
Die  Die  Die  Die
Scumsuckers  Debility divulged
Anal fuckfest thrill Olympics
Savage scourge supply and sanctify
So what  So what
So what  So what
Die  Die  Die  Die
Die  Die  Die  Die
You said it
Sedatives supplied become laxatives
My eyes shit out lies
I only kill to know I'm alive
So what  So what
So what  So what
Die  Die  Die  Die
respect
Die  Die  Die  Die
Destroy us or make us slaves
A screaming headache on the promised age
Killing time is appropriate
So what  So what
So what  So what
Die
Die
Now that I know what it's like
I'll kill them all if I like
Only time will decide
No one listened to reason
it's too late and I'm ready to fight
So what  Now I'm ready to fight
I'm ready to fight 
Fight 
So What  
Will these dreams still follow me
When the dark comes curing time
Can't you see it off in the sky
It kicks you in the face and sucks you dry
I really couldn't be bothered with you
Get out of my face watch me die
Burning inside  Burning inside
Absolution and a frozen rule
All the dreams of men below
I try to grab it but the touch is hot
The mirror collapses the image may not
I'm scared of the darkness in light
I scare myself because I know I'm right
I see the evil the savage eye
That cuts right through the sky
Burning inside  Burning inside  
Call me the mantra with a blade in his skin
Holding demons within
I feel the pain as they start to decay
The lesson never fades away
Don't need no shadows turn them away
Become a man through the window pane
Another slave and a victim of fate
Another lesson in hate
Burning inside  Burning inside 
Burning inside 
It's burning Inside
Thieves thieves and liars murderers
Hypocrites and bastards and lechers
Get up  Get up get on your feet
Hey thanks for nothing
Morals in the dust
Twofaced intellectual cripples
No trust
We are all fighting for a new race of man
Not the race of these pigs
And their racist society
Take off
Thieves  Liars 
Inside outside which side we don't know
My side your side their side we don't know
Who started it  Who started it
Who started abandoning abolishing hate
Who started it  Who started it
Who started affecting freedom
Inside outside which side we don't know
My side your side their side we don't know
You're like a great big fucking cock
Just waiting to get squeezed
We're gonna rip this mother fucker off
We're gonna tear this mother fucker down
Get up  Get up get on your feet
Breathe  Forfeit erection
Toxic our injection
Geriatric fuckfest
With a scintillating lie
Kill him  Kill kill kill 
Take off
Thieves  Liars 
Inside outside which side we don't know
My side your side their side we don't know
Who started it  Who started it
Who started the fight between color and hate
Who started it  Who started it
Who started affecting freedom
Inside outside which side we don't know
My side your side their side don't wanna know
Power to the people  Sieg heil
Power to the people  Police officer
Kill kill kill   You will not kill
I like peace you want peace
I can't hear you I still can't hear you
You ran out of lies
You ran out of lies  Lies
Stronger than reason stronger than life
The only truth I know is the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes
Just like a car crash just like a knife
My favorite weapon is the look in your eyes
You ran out of lies
You ran out of life
You ran out of lies
Get out of my life
And I'm chewing on glass and tasting my fingers
I'm not the one who's run out of lies lies
You ran out of life
You ran out of time
Judging my faith and walking on splinters
I lost my soul to the look in your eyes
Your eyes  You ran out of lies
Ran out of time
Stigmata  You ran out of lies
Oh you have empty eyes  yes
Oh you have empty lies  yes
They told me nothing
Nothing but lies
Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes
Fuck  Fuck  Fuck  Fuck
Fuck me  Fuck me
Fuck you  Fuck you
Fuck everyone  Fuck the church
Fuck Jesus  Fuck Mary
Fuck the Jews  Fuck the Bhuddists
Fuck the Hindus  Fuck George Bush
Fuck his ugly wife  Fuck Tipper Gore
Fuck everyone  Fuck Gorbachev
Fuck Noriega  Fuck all these assholes
Fuck you  Fuck me  Fuck all of you
Stigmata  Stigmata  Stigmata  Stigmata
They told me nothing but lies
Lies  Lies  Lies  Lieswith age comes regret
but regret never changed a thing
when will i learn to grow from my mistakes
or hating my friends for living their own lives
no matter what it takes from me
i know i'm only human but what more could i be
has done nothing but hold me back
i'll show this world my heart forever unbroken
my words are anchors they hold me back
my words are anchors and i'm easily attached
i try to live my life in reverie
but those thoughts will never set me free
will they ever be reached 
or will the rain just wash them away
time keeps disappearing as i lose my youth
every dream ends with a promise
a promise of something greater than this 
but theres nothing left to show
from the burden left around my neck
i just cant let my life be forgotten
if i can make it through these days of longing
then i'll learn to sing a song of hope
but sentiment is all i have to remind me
that i was meant for more than this
reflection
this is my conviction
where am i drawing true inspiration
like i've got it all figured out
i am no godsend
i am no walking saint
an endless search to fill our lives with purpose
i know that i have been selfish
but that's something we all can change
we all have the means to break our chains
we are supposed to be the change we wish to see
what does it take to make a man
i've made my amends
love let me go and this is what we've become
i never knew how i'd get myself over this
was so much more than a whisper in my ear
the coming fall air will be my best reminder
we were never meant to last
you just walked away
but even with the lungs you stole from my chest
i found a way to breathe without you
this is the end
i'll never look at you the same way again
and really it's not like i'm some golden boy
do the world a favor and never sober up again
you play the victim so well
as if none of us can tell
that's no way for a woman to carry herself
that's no way for a woman to respect herself
World in panic the first victim falls
Mass confusion bloody stories told
As you feel your insides being eaten away
Glowing with florescence
Insectile demons fly
Tunneling though your flesh
No hope to survive
A meteor from deep space
Exploding through the atmosphere
Sending microinsect death
Upon the world just like a plague
Leaving colored trails behind
A whining sound from beating wings
Delivering instant agony
A living bullet enters your skin
The pain travels quickly
Never in a straight line
Chewing a crooked path
Devouring your innards
Tunnel through your
Tunnel through your flesh
Missing vital organs
Leaving you a wreck
Partially hollowed body
About to fall apart
Instant digestion
Their feeding never stops
Ferocious tiny creatures
Stripping bones and flesh
Numbered at 10000
Or have they already bred
Tiny razors in their faces
Make powder of your bones
Leaving us their mangled prey
To die a drawnout death
The world seems to glow with a multicolored haze
Eardrums bursting as billions now attack
The planet now consumed its time for suicide
Tunnel through your
Tunnel through your flesh
Tunnel through your
Tunnel through your flesh
Runaway and fear its you I want to kill
You went too far its your time to die now
Had to push your luck dickhead attitude
Without your friends here now youre nothing
Thinking of your pain with a smile on my face
Knowing to myself it was worth a long wait
Almost in my grasp gonna break your bones
Your talk was cheap now fill my wrath
Got away with it once its my turn
No second chance
No second chance
You apology is no accepted
No second chance
This is more fun than I expected
No second chance
Splitting teeth bloody nose
Looked diseased smashed his toes
Sliced him up poker in his eyes
Ripped his ears he almost dies
Broke his ribs pissed on him
Shit himself I had to grin
Broke his arm broke his legs
Took his wallet smashed his head
Hypocrites with their comments
What really do they know
Let this be an example
Of how my anger grows
Laughing at your lifeless corpse
Knowing not a soul would care
Id do it again if I had the chance
Tear you limb from limb
Laughing at your lifeless corpse
Knowing not a soul would care
Id do it again if I had the chance
Tear you limb from limb
Got away with it once its my turn
No second chance
No second chance
You apology is no accepted
No second chance
This is more fun than I expected
No second chance
Youre bound by invisible chains
Stricken with terror as I spread my black wings
Waiting in line one by one
No more crucifixions this is more fun
Dreading the thought you must be in hell
Choking on vomit the sickening smell
A huge deep razor just paper thin
Cuts right down through the bone as I grin
Crying innocent wondering why
Is this the way that they should die
Lead single file on through the gates
On to the slaughter all life I hate
Levitation guides their way
As the pictures growing clear
People being skinned alive
Sliding down a huge steep razor
Chunks of meat falling to the ground
Lifes now pain as it turns out
Soul awake a painful gory birth
Sliding still a shredded skeletal mess
Feeling the pain of a thousand paper cuts
Gravity forcing the weight of your body
Down the throbbing pain of release
Dismembering slicing down though your soul
I scream in joy as I watch you fall apart
While I play in the ribbons of your flesh
I bask in the glory of the remains of my victims
Your once human form just a pile of lifes pain
Time eroding the surface of the earth
Consuming process increasing its speed
Ignorant humanity not thinking of the future
Atmospheric disaster is taking its course
Caustic rain burns away our grim future
Aerosol chewing hole in the ozone layer
Industrial waste smog pumped down your throat
Burning
Ultraviolet rays searing death
Burning
Crusted skin from contact with the sun
Burning
All life will cripple lie down and die
Burning
Global suicide
Burned out planet running out of its resources
Natural disaster showing us no remorse
California is about to drift away
Million dollar corporations destroying the earth
The surface of the earth reduced to ash
Cause of corporate scums quest for cash
Buy our product its not so bad
And we listen what the fuck
Like I should talk I buy them too
Alternative products for us to change
Whats one more spray can gonna do
Times one billion this equals doom
Problems the whole worlds away
Seems like no one fucking cares
Fucks with my head to fucking think
I might get to see the world die
Planet in flames all lives dying
Evaporation of our waters
Death comes with every rising sun
Abused planet dying quicker
Forget about a fucking future
Revolution is whats needed
Boycott of destructive products
Pollutants waste away our atmosphere
How will we breathe when there is no more air
No one will care to be alive
When our planet turns into burning hell
This must be a purgatory for a life full of sin
This is my hell but it is the place for me
Theres plenty of pain and a lot of misery
Ill be fine as long as they bleed
Cause nothing here dies and we all have to feed
This must be a purgatory for a life full of sin
This is my hell but it is the place for me
Theres plenty of pain and a lot of misery
Ill be fine as long as they bleed
Cause nothing here dies and we all have to feed
My hell
Our worlds destruction can only be prevented
For so long until its termination
Technological advances 1000 years behind
We have no choice no choice but to die
Maybe by the wrath of god
Or maybe Satans finally won
The planet kept its fucking peace
It didnt matter still begun
Death is here apocalypse
No more future souls are ripped
Armageddon in the skies
All thats heard are whimpering cries
Not a single missile launched
Just a couple bullets fired
Natural disaster caused the earth to expire
Now
I like that
Earthquakes collapsing cities
Destroying electrical power
Our source of food cannibalism
Only blood quenches the thirst
The oceans we knew crashed themselves off
Coastlines which are now extinct
Like animals we hunt down our prey
And countdown our final days
Volcanic eruptions coating our cities
Rivers of fire causing annihilation
Acid starts to rain from blood red skies
The planet we once knew shows no signs of life
Walking through a mist towards a reddish light
I wander for what seems to be days
A vision of a child just steps away
But she remains just out of reach
I lived a normal life did my share of sinning
Not enough to burn in hell
I realize I was wrong  my destiny is clear
Fucked over and Gods to blame
Transformation the demon takes its form
Attacked and dragged through the gates
Rewarded by the guards of hell
Revenge is on my mind
Evil beings inform me of my fate
They say Im to serve the master
Sitting on his throne hes laughing
Knowing I will bring disaster
I burst through the earth in the form of a demon
A winged living corpse with great intelligence
Feeding on people and taking their lives
Fuck morality I wasted my whole life
I tried to live a life of morality
Expecting a free trip to heaven
Overlooked by God to suffer for eternity
He will never be forgiven
Sleeping in the meadow lands among the shit
Romping through the cemetery destroying it
Blowing off everything blowing off God
Dont regret a single thing I was born a slob
18th year creeps up on me
So the cops keep telling me
They cant wait they point and laugh
I was the one they could not have
A violent breed of sickened child
This place is so fucking embarrassing
Would you come here on vacation
Stepping on an AIDS needle or kneehigh in shit
This place made me what I am Psychotic
22 a man of the world full of responsibility
Live on my own just getting stoned
Sucked even more into the city
Look out my window
The trees growing from concrete
This state is my enemy I cannot defeat
Welcome to New Jersey
Put a gun to your head instead
Welcome to New Jersey
Youd be better off dead
Theyre in control
Torment my mind
They have my soul
Poltergeist
Apparitions souls from hell
Have my mind theyre in control
No escaping invisible forces
Their deafening laugh makes me cringe
Thoughts of ending my life are here
Theyre in control
Torment my mind
They have my soul
Poltergeist
Staring yourself blind
Into the flame of no return
You blew out the candle
With the key to freedom in your hand
The only light in the darkness
Is the reflection in the mirror of your soul
With bleeding wounds you seek refuge
In the comforting red light
In suicidal glory
You were drawn into the flame
No life no regrets no return
Blew out the candle
Awaken suicidal glory
Once consumed by the fire
Life ceased to exist
And you once again awoke
With blind folded eyes
In suicidal glory
You were drawn into the flame
No life no regrets no return
Blew out the candle
Awaken suicidal glory
The clock is ticking  time is running out again
Proud visions burning in a fire of emptiness
Depression anger sin passion fear and pain
Words spoken through a filter of apathy
Holocaust  the world is burning again
Chaos  direction lost a long time ago
A shallow piny for all of us to see
And my phrases got emptier every day
It's been a journey through a hundred years
That never seems to come to an end
Nothing but ashes remain
The clock is ticking  time is running out again
A repetition of what seems to be fate
The failure is complete as the angels fall
And my phrases got emptier every day
It's been a journey through a hundred years
That never seems to come to an end
Read my scars like an open book
With pages made of human flesh
Letters drawn in purest pain
Telling you of a life in vain
I have written my final chapter
I died because i did not die
Now i stand among others
Their human lives Disintegrated
I felt I dreamt I bled
Cold silent dead
I felt I dreamt I bled  still i stood
Incarcerated
Cold silent dead  human life  disintegrated
Incarcerated
Disintegrated
Right there at the top of the world
Watching the exalted masses
Nowhere to hide  nowhere to run
The day of death has finally come
No remorse this time
It's execution time
The slaughter has just begun
Frustration growing bigger every day
They all knew  his day had to come
But their lust kept them silent
Nowhere to run  nowhere to hide
And their hunger for more have drowned in blood
No remorse this time
It's execution time
the slaughter has just begun
Frustration growing bigger every day
Afraid you hide from what you cannot believe
The truth ain't stainless it will only deceive
The primal fear is loosing control
Regaining life but without the soul
Abort the lies and tell me  What do you see
Misanthropic truth kept deep inside of me
Of skin and bones the will is inside
You cut me up and left me open wide
From the burning core comes
The guidance of sin
Use when all is lost
When nothing's left to win
Sick of built  anxiety deep within
Your own life  is your biggest sin
I can see through your illusion
For i deny your sickening love
I walk alone through the chambers of death
Reopening the wounds of my soul
From the burning core comes
The guidance of sin
Use when all is lost
When nothing's left to win
It's bitter how the world has become
Tied up untold controlled
The power invested in me
The paralysis of the strongest man
In trust
Human lust
Emancipation of embodiment
Breeds no control
Who will abort the last child
Will it be me Take a stand or be passive
Who will abduct the last child
Let us decide it's human control
It's painful how the human beholds
The paralysis of the weakest child
In trust
Human lust
Emancipation of embodiment
Breeds no control
My words told
But silence hold
yes/no
It's human control
Who will abduct the last child
Let us decide it's human control
A pointless being with primitive ideals
Keeps crawling under my skin
And his world is built on lies and dreams
Passenger
Time is burning fast
I'm struggling to be released from these chains
So i keep exploiting the hunger that i appease
And i know that time is on my side
Passenger
Your time is running out
Your journey has come to its end
Passenger
Time is burning fast
Insanity I hear the dead men speak
In agony I watch their healed wounds bleed
Scarred but not yet fragile the questions I read
Let me take you to my haven
Where you can become
Stronger than all the soul is immortal
Let me take you to my haven
Where everything's told
Everything's done the life is immortal
Tranquillity i watch the dead men sleep
Blasphemy something that someone once told
Scarred but not yet bleeding the answers are old
Let me take you to my haven
Where you can become
Stronger than all the soul is immortal
Let me take you to my haven
Where everything's told
Our existence through a one dimensional hole
Welcome to our doom what we call earth
And then when the written word will pass away
Nation of an enigma a troubled existence
This is how people lose control
'Son this is the worst in me'
'Father we will bring you relief'
Fear my wrath
Flashback of our coexisting disorders
nightrage of our upcoming disease inside
Let people raise their flags
Hell no Waiting the dawn waiting the pest
to summarize how to merge with the everything
We are waiting the dawn
The men who are waiting to be get known
Hold on I wont raise the sea
Father bring this back to me
'Son this is the worst in me'
'Father we will bring you relief'
If there is a sign that we are all waiting for
You are setting up this world to an end
New ark Ready to be released at the end
And scream it as your last words
I dont even know What and where we want to go
Desperation kills the sun of our hope
Two more lies or we will return to the center
I raise you you erase me No you cannot erase me
Wave the flag of grief beyond recovery
Let the world not to consume
Erase and reach them for our sources
If I could reincarnate as a deadly virus
Dealing with the same hell round and round
Round and round again
Tear this world apart
If I could reincarnate as a deadly virus
The meaning of life
Let the thousand knives inside your mind
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂIf I am really a part of your dreams
Ascending to our thrones
Had no choice
Eternal together
Systematically wreck down the walls of disrepair
Two parallel dimensions and a reasonable care
of what we had and what we wish for
three methods of an inward warfare
You sound this mental alarm
Command to isolate them all
Systematically wreck down the walls of disrepair
Two parallel dimensions and a reasonable care
of what we had and what we wish for
three methods of an inward warfare
Hey what and what we gonna tell you
Take your chance to wake up from your daydream
Awake right now
Its so good to breathe again fulfill to awake
Awake right now
This is a symbol of fracture a symbol of heart
our senses are repeating to the sound
Callousness designed at the natal of our life
We maintain for a supply framed in your dreams
We call it out do not obey to the sound
Beyond the frequency range of visible light
towards the sun and scream it from your heart
InfiniteÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂI amÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinfinite
infiniteÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂwe areÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinfinite
Substance of the point within the untouchable
a useless effort to seek for an empty silhouette
Beyond the frequency range of visible light
towards the sun and scream it from your heart
If the doors of perception were cleansed
Everything would appear to man as it is
InfiniteÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂI amÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinfinite
infiniteÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂwe areÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂinfinite
Substance of the point within the untouchable
a useless effort to seek for an empty silhouette
What and what we want and where want to go
This future hum of the underground
What and what we want and where want to go
We will not allow you to burn down our kingdom
I am the one I am the one who knocks
Let the world not to constellate the sun
the one who sails sails across the globe
What and what we want and where want to go
This future hum of the underground
Determinate
What and what we want and where want to go
This future hum of the underground
One is evil
The other is good
empathy generosity compassion and faith
Which wolf will win
The one you feed
Slay your furtive self
Your inside sorrow is my inside hollow
Here we are for the world we know
Let it go what is past is prologue
Ahol arany egyenl
Our insecurities will crumble this society
We become the face of a new extinction
Justifying genocide
We will adapt to survive in this atmosphere
Genocide of reason will lead to extinction
Our dominion has ended behold the fall of man
Nothing to lose no friends or family
All my fucking life I've never known peace
I will return to inflict my torment
A beloved name inside my heart
A fleeting glance became the start
A missing word I am still awaiting
A wretched deception I am creating
I am a sinner and I worship evil
Blood is thinner but you will never know
Can you confess that you thrive in chaos
You're a sorceress and your eye is on the lost
But you're dying
It's in your eyes
You're a charlatan
You get everything you wish
You're a harlot
Carry poison in your kiss
Beg forgiveness
With a dagger in your hand
Sow your death seed
And reap the dying lands
But you're crying
It's only vice
Empty vessel
Drained of hope
And none the lesser at the end of
A rope
Have you ever hated like I
Know I still awaited the absence of lies
Watch your eager tongue
Attack me from behind
Riddle whispers
Bleak futile control
Like a twin sister
Adapting to a role
You're a murderer
Bloodlust increase
You're a harvester
Come close to spread disease
And you're hiding
I hear you cry
Sun hangs high I turn away
Failure underground
Heart is sick and fever is high
Waiting for a sound
Like a trail of insects to me
I watch them from afar
Feeding breeding scheming
Tell me I am wrong
Hiding from discovery
Staring down into the ground
Had they seen the posion in me
A tide of spite wound be found
Moving faster lingering gaze
Feasting on my sanity
A grain of sand against endless waves
A wish for the slaughter of conformity
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Inside me sleeps a violence waiting to be freed
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light as the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Blinding light and the flames grow higher
Searing skin on a funeral pyre
Should I speak and they'll call me a liar
I'll retreat to my funeral pyre
My sanctuary a thousand centuries
I'm not waiting I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting I'm tired of waiting
I'm not waiting
You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife
And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh
You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife
And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh
And time it waits for no one
It heals them when you die
And soon you are forgotten
A whisper within a sigh
You're stuck to the failures of your life
Marred with the sorrows of your strife
And you can never find the satisfaction
When you can't outgrow your false distractions
And on the furthest day
When you lay down
Discard your disarray
And your rusted crown
And face the wretched image of you and I
No trust in what you say
You are a dead poison seed
Stronger when you're away
You have nothing that I need
The rhyme has settled in the ghost of a sigh
Nothing now remains
Now you will leave me be
Sunrise into the moonlight
A broken body lies in wait
Your prize won you the stark night
And you made peace with your fate
Blind eyes sensitive only to white light
Reacting just a bit too late
Preying on insecurity
A design of your schemes
A true believer of purity
Must tend to what it means
Or allow its gospel to turn into a lie
You forsake everything you feel
In favor of despair
Immune and blind to everything that is real
In your secret lair
And cast away the captive heart that was thine
And you will go and leave me be
Winter in your soul building a wasteland
And you tread a thin ice 'neath your feet
Sneering and everyone you would shun
Collecting flowers to your wreath
Lifeline a river cuts deep in your cold hand
It's changing when you try to breathe
Leave it all behind you
There is comfort in giving up
A seed in barren soil
Might curl up into a coil
Flourish into something new
Give back what you thought was you
And give way to all that is new
Leave it all behind you
Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line
And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away
Until I take my final breath
In a year or even less
I hope you will give me all your time
And do not forget me down the line
And I will never ask you if you will stay
Or if you will cry when I go away
Ice melting into the sea
Your river flowing back to me
And when you take your final breath
In many years from now no less
I hope you feel a peace at heart
Do not be afraid to kiss the dark
And do not ever wonder if I stayed
My love for you cannot die away
Hold me in your arms
Never do me harm
Never do me harm
Hold me in your arms
A raging sea in your eyes
Gives away your disguise
Grants me the peace to leave
And finally leave you be
An afternoon walk through the park
I keep to the shadows until it's dark
I am not educated nor free of sin
I carry thoughts of giving in
There is a void surrounding me
No sound and in the black I can not see
There is a chasm between you and me
You have no face no body no words to speak
There is a wickedness in me
I cannot seem to make it go away
I am a spiritual leper but I can see
A flock of believers gone astray
There is eternal night in my gaze
I am cast out and I am not like you
Find my way on through the haze
I am liquefied in a strange brew
An early morn walk through the park
I look to the sun when it's cold and stark
I blend with the crowd of robot minds
Never a leader I am always behind
A voice through the rain tells me I'm here
A glance from a veil brings me to tears
Up until recently I have been alone
Leading a tranquil life but never at home
Something had changed and I turned to the wind
That blew through me and told me
How long How long
Silenced the voice of my heart now for years
I was perplexed by a fleeting blank stare
Then came clean
Or am I wrong
I spend all my days contemplating my will
For the weak shall inherit the earth
When it's still
A government bid for my life
I was sold as a cog in a machine
I walk the line
A fleeting glance again
Tells me everything
Took a chance in vain
Drawn to a futile idea
A pursuit of happiness
As the storm rolls in
An idol of helplessness
Paved the way and then gave in
I met with my mother and I asked her why
For ten years or more she would never reply
Suddenly she said we're all born to die
Gave me purpose
Freed me
How simple it can be
But it's fading away from my mind
There's another me waiting behind
But it's fading away from my mind
There's another me waiting behind
There is a sign in the rain
Every now and again
It's a symbol of hope
In the midst of a catastrophic episode
In the hour of death
There is a spiritual wealth
When we dance through the rain
And form the signs once again
If even for a second
I hear a voice on the air
It has a warning to share
Do not believe what you see
You cannot perceive what you feel
But if I do what I am told
And shun the spirit I hold
I am no longer a human
And I will not shift with the sands
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you
There are moments of doubt
When I do not know what to do
And giving in is the only way out
When there is too much shouting
About how I should choose
Incapacitated I am left behind
In a sea of hatred I go blind
A storm is coming I hide away
In the years of need reason leads astray
The end of an era
One starts anew
You know the devil
He lives in you
The years went by with disquieting grace
A past obsession sunk without a trace
I moved into winter and found my home
As my boiling blood had turned to chrome
I am going away
I am going down
Sifting through a memory
Before it fades away
Adolescent secrecy
A million words astray
I cannot remember happiness
I thrive within the dark
The security of a loneliness
Is a veil that keeps my calm
By the way I am doing fine
I have a place to stay just behind the sunshine
And by the way I do not need sympathy
I have a place to lay
I have more than you can see
I walk the streets alone at night
It helps to ease my mind
I lay me down come the morning light
And leave all woes behind
On a wind that is sailing through the morning
I have cut the harness off of my heart
On a tide that's rising with the dawning
I find I belong inside the dark
And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
Carry me home
There is a dream that tells me I am haunted
It comes to visit every fortnight or so
I wake up having lost all I have ever wanted
And a bleak apparition wants what I hold
And when the waves roll in to cover me in shame
I avoid another sign of the efforts made in vain
Carry me home
Should it disappear should it go away
Could it reappear like a familiar tale
All you know is that you think you know it all
Its your mistake
You cant be saved
Its so hard to hard to ignore you
Making me so angry I could explode
Ill make you know it
And rip out your throat
You never change
Im looking forward to the best days
But all I can do is wish that I never met you
Cause I hate you
Its just the way I work
No time for your blank stares
Its just the way I work
Save your bullshit for someone who cares
You cant be saved
I live by a code of fucking disrespect
If you want me to stop
You better not hold your breath
Im looking forward to the best days
But all I can do is wish that I never met you
Cause I hate you
Ill never stop disrespecting you
All eyes on me center of the pit
Feelin good and feelin free lets move this shit
Judgemental piece of shit
take your skateboard home and just fucking quit
Ill tear those snake bites right out your lips
You are all so much cooler than me
Hes as hard as a rock right now
Talk about a boner
He keeps on asking me for her number
Ive never been attracted to that bitch
Cause Im not into skinny ass scene chicks
Nobody here even likes music
This kids crew and that kids crew
They just wanna fuck with you
Why dont we turn the music up
And shut the fuck up
My scene is dead because of you
Aesthetics and the music too
You sing about things youll never fucking do
Judgemental piece of shit
take your skateboard home and just fucking quit
Ill tear those snake bites right out your lips
Jack Starkey got a black eye
I think hes gonna cry
Like its the end of the world and hes gonna die
Oh my god our so cool
Youre smoking Newports
I love this music
I hate these kids
All eyes on me center of the pit
Feelin good and feelin free lets move this shit
Judgemental piece of shit
take your skateboard home and just fucking quit
Ill tear those snake bites right out your lips
All you kids in the crowd
Ill turn your smiles upsidedown
Dont blame yourself blame everyone else
I choose not the road of the righteous
Anyone whos ever felt an ounce of pain
Or shame in their life can play this game
We dont give a fuck and well never regret it
Call their bluffs
Let the world know thats enough
Raise your hands into the sky
If youre out of your fucking mind
Were all a little crazy sometimes
But Im out of my mind all the time
Its so hard to look the world in the eyes
Theyre everything I despise
Everything is wrong
Everything you love is gone
So raise your hands in the sky
And make sure they know
that youre out of your fucking mind
Call their bullshit
Call their bluffs
Thats enough
We dont care we dont regret anything
They can fight it but they know were the kings
We will stand strong
we wont ever let anyone take us down
The worlds a cold bitch
Fuck if I care what they think
So raise your hands in the sky
If youre out of your fucking mind
We can hardly be defined as human beings
We make our mark on this world we have a meaning
We have power but not enough
The way we live is tough to contain
Well tear your walls to the ground
and build our own in their place
Just watch your back in this place
You disgrace you will live in shame
You disgrace you will live in shame
You are man hear you roar
Fuck you cause were so much more
Well tear your walls to the ground
and build our own in their place
Just watch your back in this place
You disgrace you will live in shame
You disgrace you will live in shame
The only way to save yourself is to give up and
Run away run away
Dont look back turn your head you might be okay
Either way its too late youre already dead
Run away run away
Dont look back turn your head you might be okay
The prideful acts of murder among men
Let this be the death of our era
From this bowels of humanity
Does murder prove right
Below the skies that are lit at night
Hail the gun of the warmachine
2000 years of destroying life
What does that mean
200 years of tyranny
What does that mean
A fraud of a country
Weak in respect we thrive on neglect
For those who surround us
The third world means nothing
Poverty  disease
Quarantined to never plague the white lives
This is the cost of murder
Let these be the words
To sound from your feeble mind
Venomous hate forms the agony
I have placed upon your heart
A tyrant falls
Not at least
Death has overcome
My eyes are able to see
No more will lives be plagued
Clad in your scornful shadow
I watch from afar
To sever the bonds between humanity
Under the moon the crescent light
A tyrant's demise is brought forth
I have banished all the lies
We will not fall
Degradation of the sacred
The almighty has ruined the earth
Endless agony that violates our human rights
Unable to see through the fog  smoke
We walk blindly through the halls
Which lead to nowhere
Here the sun never shines
But is covered by the ignorance of man
Cloaked  drenched
In the unforgiving substance of apathy
The future of tomorrow is bleak
With the self righteous
Commanding the tyrannical armies
Soldier s trained not to think or breathe
Killing machines reign supreme
Eyes upon the beautiful
There is no salvation
Into the depths
Of abysmal torment
Let me stop this spreading disease
The betrayal runs deep
Into the veins of man
To cast down and degrade
We have been betrayed
Tear down their heavens
Set ablaze their sorrows
Denounce the name
That was given
The plague will be killed tomorrow
Enslave the angels
Conquer the divine
Plague the thoughts of men
Take away their dignity and self pride
You died for me my slate is clean
Not due to false ideal
I call out your lies to the public eye
Behold the future
One that will lead to casualties
He holds all men equal yet you claim to be god
The war of ages is never ending
It boils that blood that fills my veins
Stirring nothing but hatred for the world
You bring many people peace on your crutch
Remove it they can stand without your touch
Sincere are the actions in men
Initiated simply by the thought of mankind
A world without your presence
A world better than the present
You have awakened the giant from it's sleep
No more will I fall victim
To unwanted emotions
A heart so cold a color of black
Not a shadow lighter for weakness
Will rise to the surface
Why is a body plagued with this
Enough pain to crumble the human mind
This time the tables have turned
For a soul that is so filled with hate
Will endure will endure
Give me the will of martyr
To prove a lesson learned
Help me remove this
From my stream of blood
A pain that yields fear
Do I fear what lies ahead
Neglect that feeling of weakness
There is no option
An open mind brings me to rest
Nothing less
With these lungs I inhale the air
It slowly escapes through my throat
Into the polluted sky
The air that gives life is gone
Removed from this earth
Each breath brings you closer
To what is the end
But the sky darkens
My lungs start collapsing
The air that gives life is taken away
How has the earth become this way
Out of my esophagus it has escaped
My breath is no longer
My lungs are empty
Waiting for a pure intake
There will be none
I am here waiting for a source to live
We're stealing the air of life
What has become of us
Must we follow
Must we beg for mercy
Breaking from this shell of silence
And solitude standing against the lies
We are ending the eternal reign
Tearing down the hierarchy
Given strength to the week willed
Force fed never again
Belonging to ourselves
No one else
We are ending the eternal reign
Save yourself
Silence has been shattered
such a fool to be so blind
serpents hide behind your eyes
and I'm their prey tonight
Here we go another game
designed to butcher someone's brain
is that emotion I see feigned
all reason's lost on the insane
Sincerity has not been found
beneath your self appointed crown
these bitter tears in which I drown
will soon be yours to drag you down
You're telling me
that I'm the most important thing to you
but can't you see
you're killing me with all the things you do
and I really want to believe it's impossible
I really want to believe it's all a dream
but I just can't seem to wake up
I just can't seem to turn on the light
one step off the edge
and the world will seem all right
You did it again
yes you in the mirror
you put your faith in a cruel world
here to drag me down to Hell
just say goodbye
Just answer me
what was the point of all that treachery
and soon we'll see
the truth behind all of your blasphemy
No never again
I'll never trust no one again
Oh the witching time
like a blackened pearl
Oh how useless seem
the offers of this world
A shroud is wrapped and bound
to Gallows led away
though innocence is mine
The dog will have his day
All the Love turned to Hate
Oh wits misery
the madness of your stay
The best revenge
a price which you must pay
The children hide behind
behind their little masks
They are at their games
the only ones who laugh
All the Love turned to Hate
So did I deserve
your lies and treachery
The curtain closes now
The bell it tolls for thee
All your lies all your shame
Step into this picture
release all your light
I think God has gone mad here tonight
You can't believe your eyes
control is so hard to keep
obsession can be hell
from which you'll never be free
It's all for the taking here tonight
Where good girls go to die
that's where I'll be
Waiting for my love with my heart on my sleeve
Forget about the future
forget about the past
My heart beats so
my hands are cold
please God make this moment last
You seek to fill me
with virtues I lack
I'll turn your pure white wings to pure black
You've pushed too far and now
you've lost control can't you see
You thought you were the master
but you're down on your knees
It's all for the taking here tonight
Where good girls go to die
that's where I'll be
remembering our love as if it were a disease
Forget about the future
it wasn't meant to last
My heart beats slow my hands are cold
Oh God it's the end at last
Innocent child
how you thought you knew me
understood my ways
my dark needs
the hunt is not the thrill I'm after
I want the kill the conquest
to be your master
wrap your arms around my pale skin
it's too late to back out you're in
on your knees and praise your new lord
deeper now and here's your reward
take me to bed and rip me apart
Is this life this degradation
this pointless game humiliation
Born to die we're born to lose
and not one choice we make we choose
And when this life is at an end
we find that Death's our only friend
Must we suffer through your games oh Lord
Can God really be so bored
We waste our lives destroying hating
while beneath our flesh a skull lies waiting
Blind to beauty blind to love
we fear of our loving Lord above
Some live their lives to play their games
some live as victims the insane
Your experiment oh Lord has failed
It's futile so I'll end this note
and find a knife and slit my throat
and come to track you down oh Lord
you better watch your back
be sure that when we meet you'll be surprised
no loving praise no glee filled cries
Just pain and hate and tear filled sighs
and the question in the end is Why
I've knelt at your alter
I've cut out my heart
I've lived in your Ruins
my pain is your art
my wrists are bound tight so as not to bleed
my eyes were so dark so as not to see
the memories of the past
are fading like a bad dream
I've never been so alone than with you
I've never been scared to dream until now
I can't close my eyes
I'll carry on screaming
your words are like ice
they melt in the heat
the cold and the pain
which you seem to breed
have become what you are
and left your ruins empty
You'll never understand
the meaning in the end
we're standing at the gate
you'll meet the darker fate
your purity and rage
your passion and your hate
you promised more than bliss
with your God and with your kiss
I'm on my knees
I beg your mercy
my soul is my loss
I'm well hung from your cross
Take me
take me in your arms my love and rape me
don't hide behind your rage
I know you love me
and always will
you're my possession
of that my love there really is no question
don't hide behind your rage
I know you love me
and always will
my better half it's true
has seen the darker side of you
innocence stripped away
Bad milk burns on your tounge
Makes you afraid
Bad milk runs in your gorge
Bad milk  Now you are here
Now it's too late
Suck  Taste  Spit
Welcome to life
Bad words crash in your ears
Bad words  Down in the womb
You couldn't hide
Bad words smashing your soul
Bad words  Could you get back
Back to the night
Suck  Taste  Spit
Welcome to life
Bad flood flushing your veins
Bad blood  Up to your head
Down to your heart
Bad blood crushing your dreams
Bad blood eats you all up
Tears you apart
You should be thankful
Suck  Taste  Spit
Fuck it
Du hast die Macht der Nacht
Deine Sehnsucht bringt dich zum Schrei'n
Denn heute Nacht hast du
Das GefÃÂÃÂ¼hl unsterblich zu sein
Du siehst mich an und all
Deine Angst ist eliminiert
Und unser Fleisch verliert
Seine Form und assimiliert
Sex  Sex  Gib mir Sex
Du hast die Qual der Wahl
Doch du weiÃÂÃÂt du musst dich befrei'n
Zum ersten Mal hast du
Das GefÃÂÃÂ¼hl am Leben zu sein
Du fasst mich an und all
Deine Angst ist eliminiert
Und unser Blut verlÃÂÃÂ¤sst
Seine Bahn und kontaminiert
Sex  Sex  Gib mir sex
Where is the sun  It is so far away
The sun is gone  Only you gotta stay
Don't mind if their words are true
Just do what they tell you to
Your will is gone  It is so far away
Their will be done  You've got nothing to say
You would believe if you only could see
But there's too much fucking dust on your  t
War  You're just a victim of war
Where is your pride  It is so far away
There's only night and you still have to stay
Don't mind if their story's true
Just do what they want you to
Where is your god  It is so far away
There was a lot  Now there's nothing to pray
You would resist if you only could see
But there's too much fucking dust on your  t
War  You're just a victim of war
Don't open your eyes  Don't care about lies
Keep holding your gun  Keep holding your toungue
Just shut you brain  You're just a victim of war
Don't care about pain  Don't care about shame
Just shut your mind  You're just a victim of war
Keep  Trying to sleep  Keep counting the sheep
Why don't you touch me
Why don't you move me
My little darling
Why don't you prove me
You wanna suck  You need your 1st cock
I'm gonna teach you
You're gonna take it
My little toydoll
I'm gonna make it
You want a cock  You need your 1st shock
Isn't it all you want
Isn't it all you need
Only your first shock
Come on and let me
I'll never hurt you
My little angel
Never desert you
You wanna fuck  You need your 1st shock
Isn't it all you want
A dickhead
Isn't it all you need
A dickhead
Only your 1st shock
You make me shiver
You make me quiver
You make me feel
Like I'm losing my breath
Don't take me higher
Don't light my fire
'Cause I'm afraid
It could burn me to death
Don't think about
Don't talk about
Forget about
Don't think about
Don't talk about
Don't speak it out
Love  Don't give me love
And as I'm yearning
My bed is burning
And then again
I am starting to freeze
And as I'm shaking
My heart is aching
And in your eyes
I can see the disease
Don't think about
Don't do it
Love  Don't give me love
Stop this
Midnight  All the kids are asleep
Moonlight  Makes them breathe in so deep
Inside  Hunger cuts like a knife
Upside  I can smell the real life
I'm climbing their beds  I lift up their heads
I open my mouth  Oh I love all the brats
'Cause I'm the breathtaker
I am the death fake  Ha
I am the fear of your family
I am the boneshaker
I am the breathtaker
And I'm gonna make you blue
Nightmares  Make your sheets soaking wet
Upstairs  All alone in your flat
You end up your sighs  You open your eyes
You struggle and fight but I smother your cries
'Cause I'm the breathtaker
The hellquaker
I am the breathtaker
And I'm really stuck on you
They open the door  You lie on the floor
'Cause I'm the breathtaker
The heart breaker
I am the breathtaker
And I'm gonna get you too
U said 'We could be a nation'
It's time  Time to make amends
Wake up  Feel the fascination
Join us  Fate is in our hands'
Raise your body
U said 'Meet me at the station
It's time  Time to be a man
Awake  Feel your domination
Restrain  Every now and then'
Raise your body
Don't think too much  Listen
I am the mood that sticks in your mind
I am the boot that kicks your behind
I am the thorn that burns in your side
I am the dawn  The turn of the tide
I am the heat that's making you sweat
I am the beat that's breaking your head
I am the sound that's giving you pain
I am the hound that's living again
U said 'Stop your lamentation
It's time  Time to understand
Live fast  Drop reincarnation
Die young  Only for your land'
Hold your head up high
Why can't things be different this year
I hope you like it anyway
Happy birthday daddy
I'm waiting for the sun to wake up with me
it's too late for the warmth to come inside
I feel the same like yesterday
Although my life is coming to an end
a little smile stretches my skin again
GOD why did you give me cancer
If you're honest then give me an answer
I'm God himself the Satan too
giving is a huge part of my being
God why did you treat me like a punisher
God why did you let all the joy go to waste
I'm sure you're hiding somewhere
Are you the one who created me
Maybe I'm the one who created you
All I want from you is a good conversation
I'm leaving today
I'll fly over Nasca
till the people in this plane
are staring at me like I'm insane
I'm leaving today
I'll fly over Nasca
till the people in this plane
are staring at me like I'm insane
I find myself onto a cliff
from one forest to another I fly
like the other day I feel the same
everywhere I go I smile I cry I'll die
Like a condor who stopped to catch his breath
I feel I'm one step closer to God
Am I so numb or just too scared
Why is it so hard for me
to open my heart and see
Ever since the day I was born
my clock is ticking backwards
Only time will live forever
All my life I was feeling so incomplete
joined others at the crossroad of fate
No more lies I just found my inner truth
forsaken desires taken by storm
summer rain wiped out of my pictures of youth
I come to me come to me come to me
It's a new world that's coming through
and clears out my point of view
This woman is so mystified
I will delay my last goodbye
I remember the time when she spoke to me
all the others disappeared from my sight
No more crying I found a reason to live
nothing can stop me cause I care anymore
summer rain mixed with my tears of youth
I come to me come to me come to me
It's a new world that's coming through
and clears out my point of view
This woman is so mystified
I will delay my last goodbye
Cause I want so much to cry
but only you can stop me my rise
It's a new world that's coming through
and clears out my point of view
This woman is so mystified
I will delay my last goodbye
The purple sky around you looks like a frame
covering the most beautiful painting
I see a picture every time I close my eyes
I taste your tears
I want to cry
I'm proud enough to lay my head
and let the pain outside
Love will tell
cause you and me will be again
the queen and king of OUR time
You let a flower come into my side
never took it just let it flow in the stream
the seeds will grow up and become new flowers
reminders of a love that will always be
I wonder why
Why every good comes to an end
it's sad but true
When love and loss knocks at your door
you will feel out of control
Who will take the blame
it doesn't matter any more
we're both lost tonight
maybe God thinks it's just a game
I'll drink another round
till the morning sun finds me on the floor
The bright sky around me looks like a frame
covering the most uncolored painting
I see a picture every time I close my eyes
I taste my own tears
Help I need somebody
Help not just anybody
Help you know I need someone
Help
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please please help me
And now my life has changed in so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please please help me
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
Help me if you can I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
You won't have another chance
come now and join our dance
Don't cry tonight I live my live
One more night together
no more wasted time
In your arms forever
for the rest of my life
In your eyes a wonder
waiting to be found
I'll keep dreaming our love
until the end of my time
Whenever life betrays you
and fears are overcoming
stand strong with a heart of a lion
Should I remember the reasons
Can I explain all my fears
Whenever life betrays you
and fears are overcoming
stand strong with a heart of a lion
Wherever walls are tougher
and you can't break through
won't you stand strong
with a heart of a lion
Whatever I believe
I just need you here with me
If you can share this burden with me
Come now and dance this waltz of deceit
The steps are always easy
be careful don't you fall on me
Whatever I believe
I just need you here with me
Whatever I believe
I just need you here with me
The smell of soil wet by morning rain
A glimpse of drops touched by the sun
But still you are so far away
and I hope to stay
Hold on to live another day
I try to smile but it's too late
Now I think it's time to fade away
The curtains go down the show ends
But now I'm so far away
and the sun seems so fake
Hold on to live another day
I try to smile but it's too late
Hold on and seize another chance
The light of dawn it warms my face
Hold on to live another day
When these moments fly
the tears are drained away
Now you got to hold on
and seize another chance
When emotions fall
it's when you've crossed the line
Just like a strange pulse through my veins
I feel a new beginning
A warm breeze calms all of my pain
Isn't life worth living
Now let me fly across the earth
just for one last time
No let me dive into the sea
just for one last breath
I wanna shape my heart like a stone
Can I just have back all my
Life wasted inside a shell full of hopes
Cause all I want is to have someone
The longing makes me so much strong
Suffering the waiting
I'll make my arms an open home
when you want to hide
A child is life I'll give you mine
for this coming wonder
A life is brought to this world
Another one departing
Pressure falling
Mind controlling
Reasons burning
Eye disturbing
Help ignoring
Sweat is pouring
Vision blurring
Purpose losing
Faith taken
Childish wanting
Adult yearnings
Lord you know I got to see her tonight
Let me spare a moment with her at last
Won the fight to feel her shining in my arms
Now I know I will be there in time
Now I'm falling
I can't feel my body anymore
Filth and rape
as I embrace my enemy
He leaves me crawling
laughs at my face
Let me out just for one moment
Just for one moment
Sweet sweet enemy
Hateful friend
Give me one moment
Give me one moment
Let not my Corpse Rot in the Necropolis
Make my flesh and bones safe from Maggots
And Any False God who Trepasses my Tomb
You whose heart has been Seized from thy breast
Save me from the Ravages of Deacay
The CrawlingFeinds Who Take away Limbs
Corpses who Deny the Inevitable Truth
Save me from those Imprisoned in the Duat
Who Know not yet they are already Dead
Save me from the Rotting dead
who sleep inside Their corpses
Whose breath becomes fire inside their water
at whose burning the sea rises at dawn
Grant Methe Immolating Flame
Burn my sarcophagus
In opposition to the lords of eternity
I beg you
Enduring the eternal molestation of flame
The great one has fallen on his side
Swarmed by the eight crocodiles
I know them by their names and lives
I save my father from them
Crocodiles of the west
Who live on the unwearying stars
Detestation of you is in me
The Nau snake is in my belly
Your flame will not be upon me
Crocodiles of the east
Who live on mutilation
Detestation of you is in me
The Nau snake is in my bowels
Your flame will not be upon me
Crocodiles of the south
Living on feces
Smoke and want
Detestation of you is in me
My blood is not in your hand
I will erase you
I will erase you
Crocodiles of the north
Living on the waste between the stars
Detestation of you is in me
Your poison is in my head
A scorpion writhes within me
I'm glad with the magick of Re
What exists is within my grasp
I'm heard in the house of the great one
Who destroys the living
I am Re
Who protects himself
Nothing can harm me
I am Re
Who protects himself
Nothing can harm me
I am Re
I have come to you that you may Heal my corpse
Permit me to go down into the Earth Forever
Such as He who will not be Ravaged
May I not become Corrupt
Such is he who is Decayed
All his bones are corrupt
His flesh is slain his bones are softened
His body is made into foul water
When he is sent to the eye of Shu
Every mortal is thus
All those who live will die
All who die shall rot
Who rots the hidden one
Who decomposes corpses
Who does what has been commanded
I have awakened in Perversion and dread
I possess not my body
I have become corrupt decayed putrid
Worms gorge upon me
Maggots infest my organs
Vermin gnaw my skull
My eyes have been eaten my ears are deaf
Rotten flesh falls from my bones
My head has romeved itself form my neck
My tongue taken away
My hair has been cut off my eyebrows stripped
I have become what I abhor
When my Patience is Finished
When the Mercy of Khufu is Exhausted
When my Subjects have Failed Me
And Continued Grace has become Futile
Then will wrath
seem the better part of Discretion
My Slaves Utter Words of Rebellion
They Curse my Name
They Bend not their Backs Unto me
Or Bow Before my Monuments
When Those who Incite Revolt are Crushed
When the Streets Run red
with the Blood of the Unfaithful
When the Hands of the Idle are Severed
And the Piles of the Skulls of the Rebellious
are as the Innumerable Stars
Then will my Wrath be Done
The Great God cometh forth to the Gate
The gods who are therein acclaim Him
A Knife in his hands Swept by Flames of Fire
Come thou who art at the Horizon
Sethu the Hideous serpent stands on his tail
And guards the Way
Sayeth Sa
The Gate Shuts behind ra
Uraei wail when the gate closes upon them
The Procession of Ra Incinerates the Sky
Until the God of the Hour a Star in each Hand
Horus the Hawk Headed
SereqAbeshi
Sekhet the Lioness
The winged serpent Semi
Besi Receives the flame
Of a horned animal Transfixed by a knife
From the neck of The Serpent Ankhi
Grows the Skulls of the undead
The cries Raise their Hands in adoration
Uraei rear their heads
Unto Horus Set
Maketh thou a Rising up for Ra
Those who cry unto Ra say
Enter in O Ra
I Bow down to the Glorious Transcent One
Vajra Kumara
Whose Face Frowns with Wrath
In Order that My Living Being
Be Released from the Extreme Suffering
Lifespan Threatened
Flame of Life nearly Extinguished
The Signs of Impending Death Have Manifested
I Bow down to the Mahakarunika
Who is a Sanctuary of Great Bliss
I Enter the Triangular Dark Pit
And utter the Syllables of Elemental Fire
Black demon Black Demon Black Demon
The Cornea of my Eyes has begun to Fade
My eyes stare Fixedly
My Limbs are subject to Spasms
Three Times I Place a Dog Tail Beneath me
Place his Excrement before me
Eat a Mouthful and Bark like a Dog
The Fall of the White Rider has Occurred
The Rupturing of the Great Tree has come to Pass
I make the Ritual of Averting Death
May I be counted Worthy of Past Actions
I fear I may have Fallen out With the Regime
An Enemy of the State
My Name is Written Amongst the Disgraced
On a Clay Image of a Bound Human Captive
The Tribunal of the Dead
I Bring Natron The Imbibing of Which Purifies
Thot Who Vindicated Osiris
In the Presence of the Great Tribunal
In Heliopolis on that Night of Battle
Of the Slaughter of those who Rebelled
In the Presence of the Great Tribunal
In Abydos on the night of the Festival
Of the Numbering of the Dead
In the Presence of the Great Tribunal
Which is on the Road of the Dead
In the Presence of He that is Nothing
On the Night of the Great Devastation
Lords of Justice Lords of the West
Who Pass Judgment upon the Dead
Since I Came Forth from the Womb
Let me Be Cleansed By Fire
Let no Evil Lay Talon or Claw Upon Me
Let my heart not be devoured
NecrosAeropagus
I asset my claim of umcompromising empowerment
I am like as unto Atum lord of all
whose spontaneous self generation
Led to the appearance of the earliest gods
and thus the material universe
there is none higher
I appear in glory as that god
who eats men and lives on the gods
as sun god I am reborn
From the womb od the sky goddess nut
Her aching body is the sky
Her nakedness the skin on which the stars rest
I am AtumKhepri who came into being of himself
I am he who opened a door in the sky
I am the horned bull who rules the sky
Lord of celestial appearings
The great illuminator who came forth from fire
to hardness the years
I am the jackal of jackals
to false temporal power who claim to be divine
The Slayers of Geb
Reckon up the Immoral
After the Weighing of the Words in Amentet
Tem saith unto the reapers
Keep Ward over the Wicked
And Bind ye Fast Those who Are to be Smitten
The Neniu Profane Apostates
The Depraved who when on Earth Cursed Ra
Shameless were their lies in Words and Deeds
The Inquitous Cannot Escape
Condemnation according to the will of Ra
Ra hath Issued Decree for their Doom
Drive Stakes to Fetter them
Weigh them down with Heavy Chains
Bind their Arms behind their Backs
Bow Them down and Make them Prostrate
Reduce them to Helplessness
In your Hands take Knives and Hack them
Make Gashes in them
Slit open their Heads
my eyes keep the fear
the pages of fate over the floor
There are shadows that talk to us
they say softly that we've the shadows
Wisper night and day os sins
There are winds that cut
Tear us apart
Decipher Us
They see in our flesh
Insecurity
Sand escaping throught my fingers
Cross Child
I'm ypur little soldier  without wars
My blood is sucked and spat in the veins
The pages of fate over the floor
Oh gog help this poor child
You've already used your child once remember
Cross Child
Silent tear dropped
in morbid pupil it shined
A morning mother cried
Her child lied on her arms
FLOATINGFLOATING
Would it be better to crowl
In a corner a sad shadowy form
Echoes a moom deep in the soul
Darkness thicken the mist babbles
In the somber night that coldly comes
CROWLCROWL
Would it be better to know how to fly
A deep moom out of the chest
Tears cutting the face
What is god this dark mistery
That with his power damned the world
THE BODY FALLSTHE BODY FALLSTHE BODY FALLS
THERE WILL BE A FUNERAL AND I'LL BE THERE

Wake up your mind Wake up your mind

Wake up your mind
I hate I feel hate
Nobody can take it away from me
My eyes express hate
My body is only hate
Hate in my tongue Hate in my hand Hate in my sex
Hate makes me stronger
Hate makes me squeak
Hate makes me roar
Yes hate makes the world goes round
I hate I feel hate
Nobody can take it away from me
My eyes express hate
My body is only hateThere is no revenge
That could wake me up from this nightmare
That attracts humanity
If you cannot see
What never existed
You will just recognize death
Faithful desire to take it away
There is no devastated end
That could stop stop the impulse
To so much loneliness
Give up the run
You have no place to go
The end is coming
It doesn't depend on you
Where this hate grows together
Where death is forever
Behind the smoke
Hiding remembrance
Where the hate lives
Only the blood that flows like water
There is no life anymore
No beatings to hear
There is no life anymore
Anymore
Can't you see
The fire is melting out its splendour
It's leaving ashes in the space
It fills me with glory I'm strong again
I'm strong again
Insane mercy melting in me
Far agony faraway from my soul
A world of hate is leaving my being
I'm strong again I'm strong again
The wish is functioning again
the mind whose lying in another life
Unflagging pleasures
Give the power back
And wake up from a long and anger sleep
Insane mercy melting in me
Far agony faraway from my soul
A world of hate is leaving my being
I'm strong again I'm strong again
Isolated with your hate
desired of all destruction
Feeling your anger adrift
Days go by you can't find yourself
You don't know how to liberate
So much hatred inside you
You don't imagine your life
With no pain no lies
Cruelty loneliness
Got over your murders life
And death played a dirty evil game
You don't imagine your life
Without evil and no hard feelings
Hard hard feelings
Hard hard feelings
Your path is ending and gets lost in the fog
With no direction imagine life
That you'll never live
That you'll never live again
You don't know how to liberate
I know the walked path reached to an end
My cold heart agonizes in front of pain
Beg for mercy and wish you could escape
Beg for mercy
Now I see the truth
And I see that light
I see the days left behind
And I feel this truth
And I see that light
And I see my soul wave goodbye
There's nothing more to lose in this life
Only the intense and catchy silence and
The void is immense and penetrating
The void is immense and
Now I see the truth
And I see that light
I see the days left behind
And I feel this truth
And I see that light
And I see my soul wave goodbye
Now I see the truth
And I see that light
I see the days left behind
And I feel this truth
And I see that light
And I see my soul wave goodbye
I see this truth I see that light
I have reasons to be alone
Dying til I see clear
There's no revenge to explain
Will never come back
I perceived your look
My time is running out
I don't stop thinking
I relax my tension exhale again
I think again I feel so little
exhale again feel so little
To lose didn't change your life
Taking everything away
Everything until the end
I have reasons to be alone
Dying til I see clear
There's no revenge to explain
Will never come back
I see it will never come back
I think again I feel so little
exhale again feel so little
To lose didn't change your life
Taking everything away
Everything until the end
I have reasons to be alone
Dying til I see clear
There's no revenge to explain
Will never come back
If you only want
If you only want to forget
What has stunned and hurt your heart
If you only want
If you only want to prove
That you haven't lost
just won
that's your decision
Your try today is satisfaction
Now you can
Now you can look ahead
there's nothing that
There's nothing that
Could stop you now
Your try today is satisfaction
You can ignore
can ignore
You can ignore
And no restrain the evil action
You could removed that deformity
In your mind
Which only hid the strength
Of your greatness
Now I know you're in the other side
I tell you goodbye bye bye
In the other side
I tell you goodbye goodbye
Now you can
Now you can look ahead
there's nothing that
There's nothing that
Could stop you now
Your try today is satisfaction
I run quickly behind that hell
It's cruel and hurt me
You feel me in sorrow
To know that you're waiting for me
I like that I know you like that
Take my soul do it
Just catch me hide the light
Just enjoy the pleasure
Stop the time
No doubts
It doesn't matter to die
Look at me take me
If you like what you're seeing
That's all what a want
It doesn't matter to die
If in the end you will be mine
Just do it
Give me the eternity
Take my soul
Take my body
I know you want it
Just do it
Without a course I'm coming to you
Destiny whispers it to me
And I know you're waiting for me
I like that I know you're observing me
Come on take my soul
I know you're
I think about it come on take my soul
The cold is back
That far eternal grey
Those deep fears
Flow from my mind away
I go through the nights away
And dawns each fucking day
While the sun
The sun it fades away
Fades away
Right now
Everything should die
It's time
Time to fucking rise
Wake up
Walk with death by your side
The wind dried
Those dark fucking tears
That I left behind in another life
That I saw die by my side
By my side
This moment lived was just a dream
The seemed pain's eternal
Just like the wind time to took it away
Never thought I'd wake up
From this doom
My world has disappeared
It's not my world
I go to other worlds
Where my instincts carry me
Today my instinct is accurate
Nothing will ever change it
Ever change it
I don't hear that madness whisper
That has vanished in front of me
I never should have believed
In that dream
Which caught my days
Slowly I touched death
It's not my world
I go to other worlds
Where my instincts carry me
Today my instinct is accurate
Nothing will ever change it
I go to other worlds
Nothing will ever change it
I go to other worlds
Nothing will ever change it
This moment lived was just a dream
The seemed pain's eternal
Just like the wind time to took it away
Never thought I'd wake up
From this doom
My world has disappeared
It's not my world
I go to other worlds
Where my instincts carry me
Today my instinct is accurate
Nothing will ever change it
Ever change it
Ah Ah
I go to other worlds
Where my instincts carry me
Today my instinct is accurate
Nothing will ever change it
All began like a sweet game
My eyes followed your steps
A bitter taste in my mouth
You left in me when you got away
And the moon was my witness
while she stole my dream
and the dream was breaking me
And my only wish was to run away
I knew the game was gonna last
but the game was over
and the game was gonna last
but the game was over
My days were so amazing that
that the night led me to lies
and the sunlight hurt my blood
I return again
I return again
I return again
Return again
In the valley of the damned
The battle's on
The troops of death
The falling army marches on
Hiding from the sun
Lurk them into darkness
Forbidden to be seen
Spirit of the evil gods
Triumph army of the ghost
Their victory inside
The enemy mutilated
Now lays before their feet
In the valley of the damned
The battle's on
The troops of death
The falling army marches on
Strike down the opponents
With wrath from below
The fallen angels' army
Will march to the throne
March
In the valley of the damned
The battle's on
The troops of death
The falling army marches on
Awaiting your sentence
Locked up in your hell
Your crime will now be tested
By the jury representing Death
Bitterness inside you
All you feel is hate
Not for the vicious crime
But for the victims you kept alive
Incision precision remove the limps
The pulse beats on the body won't turn cold
I stab I drill my intention's clear
My hands they squeeze but the bastard won't die
Hang him high
No remorse for the crimes you've done
Hang him high
Blood on your hands won't wash away
Waiting on deathrow
Staring at the walls
The cell is closing up on me
Memories I can't defeat
I stab I drill my intention's clear
My hands they squeeze but the bastard won't die
Hang him high
No remorse for the crimes you've done
Hang him high
Blood on your hands won't wash away
A scarred and abused soul
Tries to cope with life
Hiding in your twisted game
He was dead before he started to feel alive
Now justice will take its toll
Hang him high
No remorse for the crimes you've done
Hang him high
Blood on your hands won't wash away
Symbols and signs painted everywhere
Predynamic hieroglyphs
A path a stargate
Armageddon awaits on the other side
Storms of hate will plow over the earth
Science working to crack the code
Bury the gateway let it go
Don't let them through
Can not gamble with the human race
Solar  empire
Resurrection of the atomic god
Solace  deceiver
Searching for another host
Through the black holes
Travelled for lightyears
Looking for another world to reign
Rebel attack with intelligent masses
Exterminate the enemy with full energy
Science working to crack the code
Bury the gateway let it go
Don't let them through
Can not gamble with the human race
Solar  empire
Resurrection of the atomic god
Solace  deceiver
Searching for another host
If we can not confirm this
Then it doesn't exist
So bury it down again for a thousand years
Solar  empire
Resurrection of the atomic god
Solace  deceiver
Searching for another host
The cryogenic holocaust
Slows down the disease
Give us all a taste of your miracle
We're thirsty for your medicine
The hate burns in our eyes
It's kill or be killed
It's in the nature of the human races' weak mind
To be exterminated by ourselves
Just stab their hearts for nothing
Your greedy souls scream in envy
Kill them all
Release the anger
Weed out the weak
You don't need them
Weed out the weak
Exterminate the riff raff
No one will miss you anyway
Clean up the world with an iron fist
Start the harvest of the dead
There's no room for the weakend mind
There's no room for you
There is a new religion coming around the bend
And it's called fuck you
Just stab their hearts for nothing
Your greedy souls scream in envy
Kill them all
Release the anger
Weed out the weak
You don't need them
Weed out the weak
Stab them all
Bright lights
Is there anybody out there
From the sky something's coming my way
It knocked me down I'm paralyzed except my mind
Something else is in control of me
Strapped down to a bench I lie
Performing surgery I'm open wide
My life just got simplified
I can't believe I'm gonna die
Dwelling in the unknown
I won't see tomorrow
They're stealing my life
They're drilling into my soul
I can't see tomorrow
I am out of time
Dwelling in the unknown
I won't see tomorrow
They're stealing my life
They're drilling into my soul
I can't see tomorrow
I am out of time
They keep me alive so they can test my strength
Pumping my body dry
I cannot feel anything anymore
I guess this is my goodbye
Strapped down to a bench I lie
Performing surgery I'm open wide
My life just got simplified
I can't believe I'm gonna die
Dwelling in the unknown
I won't see tomorrow
They're stealing my life
They're drilling into my soul
I can't see tomorrow
I am out of time
There is no tomorrow
They're stealing my life
The colonisation of a new species
Infecting you and me
The virus has mutated
Into an extraterrestrial biological entity
The blessed ones will be genetic hybrids
The survival is the ultimate ideology
We got to fight the future
Presented to an extended holocaust
It has started
The global domination
Mass infection
Waiting to be reconstituted
And colonized by an alien race
And unvolved pathogen
The mass infection will make us a slave race
The blessed ones will be genetic hybrids
The survival is the ultimate ideology
We got to fight the future
Presented to an extended holocaust
It has started
The mass infection
Treasure hunts in suicide land
The hurting never stops
It's time to meet your enemy
Bleeding games with buried anger
It will be too late
When you're done you'll plead insanity
Drown them in the dirt
Energize the will to kill
Never say a word
Strike them where it hurts
Torture with all you got
A taste of extreme divinity
Stealthy shadows of the mad
Lionize his victory
Legacy of a sick twisted man has been born
Razor sharp brain with desire
Desire for the kick
The kick to kill
Drown them in the dirt
Energize the will to kill
Never say a word
Strike them where it hurts
Torture with all you got
A taste of extreme divinity
Psycho dances with a knife
He comes for your flesh
Knock you down tie you up
Feel the blade break your skin
You call yourself a god
I call you a liar
Reclaim my past don't need no sympathy
Brainwash the weak
Steal all you can steal
Defenseless minds of the dumber kind
The church is working overtime
The book of lies becomes alive again
Translated twisted read between the lines
The ancient book is still alive
And now they can not tell the truth from lies
They convince you that you're nothing
And nothing but dirt
If you don't contribute
You're no son of god
Donate your life and money that you earn
If you wanna see the light you got to sacrifice
Brainwash the weak
Steal all you can steal
Defenseless minds of the dumber kind
God is working overtime
The book of lies becomes alive again
Translated twisted read between the lines
The ancient book is still alive
And now they can not tell the truth from lies
Don't wanna live in sin
They will make you learn
If you're gonna sin
Then you're gonna burn
The book of lies becomes alive again
Translated twisted read between the lines
The ancient book is still alive
And now they can not tell the truth from lies
One's loss is another's pain
When someone falls then the others gain
Misjudged and stripped down to the bones
The industry is getting rich on the poor
They'll make you bleed out your anger
No one will ask you for your forgiveness
The quest for the sign
Will stop at nothing
Follows the book of lies
Your god told you to look for the sign
Suck 'em all dry like a parasite
Kill a million people
And kill another million more
They don't believe in what you believe
It's not your gods' call
Misjudged and stripped down to the bones
The industry is getting rich on the poor
They'll make you bleed out your anger
No one will ask you for your forgiveness
The quest for the sign
Will stop at nothing
Follows the book of lies
Your god told you to look for the sign
Suck 'em all dry like a parasite
Everything is build on conspiracy
Nothing has been changed
We just smile accept everything
Why do we turn our backs and walk away
It's hard to tell right from wrong
It's all a conspiracy
Like blindfolded cattles
And lead us on til the end
We all are living in a twisted society
Nothing's gonna stop them
When the truth won't set us free
Tamed
Filled with fear
Sky is falling down
Sophistic energy
A crack in the core
A burning sodomy for liberty
Feel the neon dots that's tattooed in your flesh
Psychotic preferences
A state of reinvent
And now the new world has just begun
Scream all you want
While they drill the holes
Lobotomy will set you free
Cyanide sacrifice
Laser beam sanctuary
Transit life suicide
Bad dreams do come true
Sky's falling down
Pull the plug
Terminate innocent tranquilized
Cannot wake up
Back in the womb
Waiting for the rebirth
Tube stuck in your veins
Monitored by machines
Back in the womb
Waiting for the rebirth
Tube stuck in your veins
Monitored by machines
Electric pulses feeding your brain
Sky's falling down
Pull the plug
Terminate innocent tranquilized
Cannot wake up
Sky's falling down
Take me home
Raped by the retribution
A failing justice at it's costs
Demanding true redemption
And regain what you've lost
In the shadows of the weakend kind
Lurking for its prey
Shapeless worthless gutless souls
From behind the desk they'll make you the
Sinner  Where the bullets reign
In the name of democracy
Rules the country with an iron fist
But the stench from the gutter
Says that they are leaders of hypocrisy
Shapeless worthless gutless souls
From behind the desk they'll make you the
Sinner  Where the bullets reign
It's brothers in arms
Shattered by your feet
Sacrificed for democracy
Left behind at the enemy line
By the land of the free
We fight
After another dreamless night
In this city of the dead
But I cant complain
At least Im not alone
Always thought
That the dead
Would be
Good company
Now Im not so sure
Am I alone in the
Land of the dead
Sometimes I think that were supposed to fade
Sometimes I think that were supposed to fail
Sometimes I think were supposed to fade
Until were all dead
Do you know
What it feels like
To be broken
I mean really broken
I know what it feels like to be washed off
Like the dirt from your night before
Deceit disease fucking actors
Deceit disease fucking actors
To speak of trust
To speak of distance
As a factor
On feelings
I hope this world breaks
I hope you ruin everything
The way you ruined us
Loveless
Cold
Fucking world
That doesnt deserve
A single tear of mine
Let it all fade into nothingness
Let me sleep and dream about constants
Something out of this world
If life is truly designed
I want nothing more
To do with it
If life turns out to be
Just another vast
Factory
I want nothing more
My complete disdain
Our infection spreading
If I had the bomb
trust me
If I could end it all I would
No more regrets
The last of my empty thoughts
And memories forgotten
Stand alone  a complex
A dying wish  come to an end
Humanity is a thousand screams
Waiting to be silenced
I'M GIVING UP HOPEI am God
If you want to know everything I will show you
What if I told you this was already planned
We are all human or are we 
Your basic primitive animal instinct 
Die 
and the only apology you can give us is that 
I should have fucked you so hard 
Fuck earths womb impregnate Modern man is insane
 Rotton entrails settle in 
This person has passed away 
Rest in peace and rest in pieces 
I know of one thing 
Isnt she so lucky 
Shouldnt we all be so lucky
Take away free speech 
Leave us kneeling at our nations feet 
GET THEM AWAY 
We can stop this 
I'M FUCKING UNSTOPPABLE
It is sad to see how music is turning 
But no one cares 
told me it's OK
but this path that I'm taking
I'm lost in the deep end
One last chance never more
told me it's all right
in this sea of denial
I'm cleansed in the fire
So why is it me
am I blinded or too blind to see
 am I too blind to see
why was I born
not a part of this society
Again and again I tried
so hard to reach for the stars
but I failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still I'm searching
Same thing different day
tried to make a change
left with nothing more to live for
but everything to die for
humanity insanity the everlasting grip
lost all will to keep trying
our bed we must lie in
So why was I born
Not a part of this society
Again and again I tried
so hard to reach for the stars
but I failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still I'm searching for
Ten thousand ways to say sorry
but life writes its own tragic story
time marches onwards and
nothing can ever be the same
But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
break free from this lifetime of sorrow
I tried so hard
to reach for the stars
but I failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still I'm searching
For ten thousand ways to say sorry
but life writes its own tragic story
time marches onwards and
nothing can ever be the same
But we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
break free from this lifetime of sorrow
Candles burning the hours turning
A countdown the day that we're born
Don't look backwards keep driving forwards
The rose withers but not the thorns
If you want it then you can take it
Just seize it before it's too late
And if all fails get back on your feet
There's always another today but still we'll
Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
In this life we're running out of days
We're running out of time ignoring it's a crime
No regrets just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive
Anger rising with endless fighting
But soon you'll be finally free
Find your way through this endless maze
Be the one that you wanted to be
Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
In this life we're running out of days
We're running out of time ignoring it's a crime
No regrets just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive
Can't you see now you're all tomorrow's kings
Tomorrow's kings
Pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
In this life we're running out of days
We're running out of time ignoring it's a crime
No regrets just one shot at glory
Is all we got before we die
Sands of time are slipping through our hands
So try and understand and do it while you can
Don't look back just one shot at glory
Is all it takes to feel alive
The light is shining
Still I'm not so surprised
One thousand voice mails
For one thousand lies
Blind faith lost trust
All along it was plain to see
Years passed lost touch
Leads the path to insanity
Take another shot show me what you got
It was never gonna last forever
Open your eyes try and realize
Once is enough so tonight now I say
No more never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right
Dark nights long passed
Waking up from a pointless dream
Brighter days brighter times
Hides the fatal reality
Questions answers
False addiction to nothing real
Lights fade crushed to dust
Desperation in tragedy
Take another shot show me what you got
It was never gonna last forever
Open your eyes try and realize
Once is enough so tonight now I say
No more never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right
No more Same old game we play together
No more Time will pass we'll still remember
No more But tonight this game is over
No more Strangers in the night forever
No more never heard so loud before
Made the same mistakes a thousand times
Never meant to be like this so I say
No more tonight
And it feels all right
And it feels all right
Lost long ago through the ages of time
Once ruled immortal the guardians of light
Bonded together they stood side by side
Quest for their hammers to reclaim the throne
Three brought together by warriors unknown
United to vanquish all hell from the earth
Conquering glory the kingdom's rebirth
Raise your swords sound the final war cry
Stand fight fight for your lives
Thousands will die but their deaths not in vain
Now reunited our world may be free once again
Three hammers high in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire protectors of mankind
Three hammers high for the world we unite
Long have we travelled through forgotten lands
From coldest valleys to burning red sands
Restless we ride through the depths of all hell
Triumph and agony death will prevail
Raise your swords sound the final war cry
Stand fight fight for your lives
Strike back with vengeance 'til death we defend
Three hammers high in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire protectors of mankind
Three hammers high for the world we unite
Strike down the unbelievers
March on for justice we now stand
Once more the path for glory
Take back the power in our hands
Long years of terror and the long years of pain
Victory's ours once again
Three hammers high in the burning red sky
Forged in the fire protectors of mankind
Three hammers high for the world we unite
Hiding in the fog
Where darkness meets the moonlight
I will sing a melody 'til the morning comes
Living for you only
Take my hand and show me
There will be much sorrow when the morning comes
Fearless Im fighting the pain burns inside of me
Find the forces of my soul
No one can understand me
Am I condemned to ride the blackest night alone
Tragic painting on the walls
In this castle where affliction reigns
So many died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again
This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
Ill find my peace another way
Under the stars where well shine again some day
Fear is leading to the night
Once united by the light
Father Look into my eyes
I shall kill you tonight to avenge
All those who died in vain
Hear their distant cries
Never again
This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
Ill find my peace another way
Under the stars where well shine again some day
This is my symphony
My dark blessing falls from the skies
I hear the voice
Rising from the void
Of the memories gone by
Dark is the path for me
Ill find my peace another way
Under the stars where well shine again some day
'Til the stars where well shine again some day
'Til the stars where well shine again some day
Inception
Deaths guiding us away
We fight 'til the end
Among the ruins
Illusion
Of brighter days ahead
In silence we stand alone
Caught in the eye
A quest for life beneath the stormy sky
The strength to rise again
Time to realize
Our race has come to nothing
We'll start it all again
The sun is dead now
Fading away forever
The darkness prevails now
But with the prayers of the dead
Now a new light ascends from the stars
Confusion
The sadness and the pain
Matricide the earth is now dead
Remember the brighter days
When hope and joy were shining in our hearts
In silence we stand alone
Caught in the eye
The fragments of my past to realize
It's time to rise again
In the world's demise
Our race has come to nothing
We'll start it all again
The sun is dead now
Fading away forever
The darkness prevails now
But with the prayers of the dead
Now a new light ascends from the stars
The sun is dead now
But in the end what did we learn
The sun is dead now
Fading away forever
The darkness prevails now
But with the prayers of the dead
Now a new light ascends from the stars
Now a new light ascends from the stars
Life's uncertain a ratrace of pain
Endlessly searching for more
Hopeless and needless held back by the chains
'Til we can't take anymore
Hold on stay strong
Breaking out from the past life fading
No more what for
All we got is to keep on praying
Pray for the done for their lives in dismay
Witness the final decay
Suffering in silence for years we were blind
But now we got something to say
Hold on stay strong
'Til the end not afraid of dying
No more what for
Nothing left but to keep on fighting
United incited not misguided
Benighted ignited still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see
So free in the blue skies with time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Cleansed in a kingdom of fire
Legions of darkness from beyond the grave
Spill their blood under the sun
Voices are calling with anger and rage
The final war now has begun
Hold on stay strong
'Til the end not afraid of dying
No more what for
Nothing left but to keep on fighting
United incited not misguided
Benighted ignited still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see
So free in the blue skies with time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Cleansed in a kingdom of unholy fire
Hear our call save us all
Standing tall tonight
The flame will slowly fade away
The shadows of our lives
We wash away the memories
Before the last sunrise
We'll keep holding on
In times of changes
Standing strong against the wind
Until the end of time
Hold on stay strong
'Til the end not afraid of dying
No more what for
Nothing left but to keep on fighting
United incited not misguided
Benighted ignited still strong and undivided
This day foretold now here for all to see
So free in the blue skies with time marches on
Once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
Cleansed in a kingdom of unholy fire
Hear our call save us all
Standing tall tonight
It's getting late at night by a freezing moon
The time is running out and the end is soon
An army in despair don't know what to do
Impure thoughts are raging in this empty room
The victims are escaping now we shall regroup
A circus of horrors waiting just for you
The barrel's bottom anything will do
So take my hand and I will lead you right into
Extraction zone the zone
You can make yourself at home
Extraction zone your zone
You don't have to feel alone
Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be
So live your life in the extraction zone
Another place another time we carry on
Not getting any easier 'cause we're getting on
A circus of horrors waiting just for you
The barrel's bottom anything will do
So take my hand and I will lead you right into
Extraction zone the zone
You can make yourself at home
Extraction zone your zone
You don't have to feel alone
Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be
So live your life in the extraction zone
As a new dawn will rise
I promise myself not again
But deep in my heart
The fire still burns just the same
It's just the same
A circus of horrors waiting just for you
The barrel's bottom anything will do
So take my hand and I will lead you right into
Extraction zone your zone
You can make yourself at home
Extraction zone the zone
You don't have to feel alone
Where dreams become reality
And standards will now cease to be
So live your life in the extraction zone
Her dream was to shine on the screen
Thought that was why she was born
Left all behind without a fear inside
But sometimes there's no lucky star to help you
Sun will go down and she's all alone
Can't help but feel insecure
She'll never stop the way to the top
Is more than she had bargained for
Her quest for the glory was real
But somehow it turned out all wrong
Heartache was never a part of the dream
Can't find a reason to keep on trying
Turn out the light 'cause deep in the night
She's like the thousands before
Hold out your hand there's hope at the end
But be careful what you wish for
Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Another night out on the streets
Finding a way to survive
Wasting your chances destroying your dreams
Counting the tears that you cry
Hiding the pain it drives you insane
But still you're craving for more
So give me your hand hold on 'til the end
And you can have what you wish for
Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Now the lights are all gone
You find yourself on your own
Now the city has gone
You find your own way back home
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by a wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire
And I fell into a burning ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
And it burns burns burns
In a ring of fire
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts just like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
But I jumped right in and the fire went wild
When I fell into a burning ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
And it burns burns burns
In a ring of fire
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by a wild desire
And I fell right into a great ring of fire
And I fell into a burning ring of fire
And it burns burns burns
And it burns burns burns
In a ring of fire
A black cloud now falls on this city
But under the lights
Been searching for answers but this time you
You feel so alive
Just free your own mind it's not easy
To give all you've got
And making the top
Run strive for the fame
Blood of the game that we play time and again
It's up to you to break these chains
Reasons to live reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
Reasons to live reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
All right
Now everyone wants to be something
A feeling so strong
But only one thing really matters
A place to belong
Don't spend all your days in the shadows
You're not on your own
But just keep on fighting
Run strive for the fame
Blood of the game that we play time and again
It's up to you to break these chains
Reasons to live reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
Reasons to live reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
All right
Reasons to live reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Reasons to live reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
Reasons to live reasons to die
Live for the power and glory
Never give up reach for the top
Find your own path and tonight we'll make it
All right
Emptiness tears inside
On the night before she died
Through the years through it all
You touched my heart you touched my soul
All the tears in my own heart beating
But I want you to know
High the mountain we must climb
So far beyond the ocean's tide
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home
And our hearts forevermore entwined
We'll save the night we said goodbye
No matter where you are you're not alone
Long nights on a road we cry
Cold thoughts of a brighter time
An empty picture in an empty frame
Won't you take me away
All the pain through my own life's end
'Til the end of our days
High the mountain we must climb
So far beyond the ocean's tide
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home
And our hearts forevermore entwined
We'll save the night we said goodbye
No matter where you are you're not alone
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home
We're torn apart but soon we'll all be home
And our hearts forevermore entwined
We'll save the night we said goodbye
No matter where you are you're not alone
Another night another inner fight
The demon's calling
My soul is dark but with a touch of light
The whole world's changing
I draw the line the pleasure redefined
It's now awakening
I feel the urge emotions on the verge
And now it's time to kill
The speed of light I feel the time is right
I've smashed all boundaries
A skull crushed adrenaline rush
The night has found me
Infection spreads a spirit through my head
The time is coming
I know the score but I gotta have one more
And for more I could kill
I am what I choose to be I lose grip on reality
And I have nothing to atone
But I'm gonna make it on my own
The sun is up but I can't get enough
The sky's the limit
I'm on the top but I ain't gonna stop
I'll never give in
It's in my brain it's driving me insane
Hallucinations
Always the same but I ain't gonna save
Destruction I must kill
I am what I choose to be I lose grip on reality
And I have nothing to atone
But I'm gonna make it on my own
I've seen the sun rise once again
I've lived my life and now I'm dead
Time to come down all on my own
This is nothing new for me
This is my reality
So open your eyes and don't ever hide away
I am what I choose to be I lose grip on reality
And I have nothing to atone
But I'm gonna make it on my own
Sometimes we play sometimes we lose
With pride or with shame
Sometimes a dream turns into dust
But who's there to blame
Try not to forget and to understand
And read between the lines
Get back on your feet you've got one more chance
To make it right this time
The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
The reason we stand with pride
Is the will to live and to reach for the stars
Sometimes the pain burns deep inside
And all seems in vain
Sometimes the fear darkens the path
And leads us astray
Tears in our eyes and our hopes are fading away
But revenge is sweet get back on your feet
'Cause a war is upon us today
The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
The reason we stand with pride
Is the will to live and to reach for the stars
The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
The reason we stand with pride
Is the will to live and to reach for the stars
The reason we stand
The reason we stand
Facing the rising sun the pain goes on and on
Pain goes on and on
Fighting until we touch the sky
Ah will to live and to reach for the stars
One step away
Just one step away
Touch the sun
Touch the sun
Touch the sun
Coming down from the mountain ranges
For the battle of ancient ages
Fight hard for the warrior soul
Wage war ride on 'til our destiny calls
Through the valley of black wind burning sun
See the warrior fight the time has come
Fight on for the powerful Lord
March on stand strong 'til the end of the world
When the sun and stars will align again
And the land is dark and gone
And the ring of fire will be born again
For the one
We just want to dream about it
We die to believe without it
The fire in our hearts in our song
The price at the gates far beyond
And when the hands of all the nation will arise
Through the wind and through the trees
For the honor of family black ninja ride on
Fight to be free
For our fallen fathers we will fight
For the glory of master through the night
Over mountains by the sea
To the land far away where the warrior lives
See the ninja ride with evil sword
For the power of powerful overlord
March on for the glory of all
Ride on fight hard for the warrior call
When the sun and stars will align again
And the land is dark and gone
And the ring of fire will be born again
For the one
We just want to dream about it
We die to believe without it
The fire in our hearts in our song
The price at the gates far beyond
When the sun and stars will align again
And the land is dark and gone
And the ring of fire will be born again
For the one
We just want to dream about it
We die to believe without it
The fire in our hearts in our song
The price at the gates far beyond
And when the hands of all the nation will arise
Through the wind and through the trees
For the honor of family black ninja ride on
Fight to be free
You weep over yourself
Somewhere between heaven and hell
Blessed be the eternally cursed
Verily I say to you
End is the beginning
Irreversible truth
Beyond alternation
I am the bringer of your final salvation
Enclothed in robes weaved with sacred sanguine
Perseverant in my way I will prepare this altar
Deprived of choice you will bow down before me
You're begging for mercy
You weep over yourself
Here I stand before you
Silence
God created hell in the heart of Eden
I see the abyss the infinite darkness
Try not to alter my mind
'Cause I see and feel and know
Leash my fury my internal firestorm
I cannot overcome it Cannot overcome
Expose your soul before me and let it bleed
It's all that I desire
Its All that I want
You're begging for mercy
You weep over yourself
Here I stand before you
Silence
A song turns into whisper
Is that God or Satan who speaks
Is it real Or is it in my head
Will I understand
You weep over yourself
I am the way
Go
All around beneath horizon
Forsaken by the Lord
Countless helpless human souls
Lying scattered cursed to rot
Stone cold Earth broken crucifixes
Burning temples sanctuaries of the sins
And all that I do everything that's my life
Pushes me straight down to the hellish fire
And that is just another frail attempt of mine
To discover what is truly deep inside me
Kneeling and praying you beg for death
Verily I say to you
Those few words ain't worth dust
Eternal torment we're beggars at the gates
Falling apart
You won't save me
On my way down
Falling apart
Would you like to follow me now
Million miles I walked alone
Been lost so many times but never stopped
You can accept the challenge
Or you can just flee
I may be wrong
My perception might be weak
But that is not enough
For me to give up
And my existence my human nature
Pushes me straight down to the hellish fire
Falling apart
You won't save me
On my way down
Falling apart
Falling down to hell
Who
Tell me who Go
Come on
Tell me who deserves the hellfire
Whose destiny ends in there
Who will wear the crown of thorns
Purgatory Paradise
Why it's you who makes the judgment
Try to judge me I refuse
I will choose my own punishment
I will end this now myself
Whispering the tragedies of life
When there is nothing that you could give
You desire a world of lunatics
And dare to pass your judgment on myself
Waiting
In the name of all demons
Enough
I clench my own fists
Enough
Your body's full of anger
Fear and malice fill your soul
You are the projection of your own hatred
A worthless outline
That is what you really are
Say nothing Say nothing
Waiting
In the name of all demons
Enough
I clench my own fists
Enough
I sense and see you falling
One second and you turn away
Poison
Your mouth spits blood
One second and you fall apart
Verily I say to you
Say nothing
One spark is more than enough
For flames to ignite the night sky
This is my time this is your time
Nothing can stop us now
I cry when I want to
I spill blood if that's my wish
Drop of rain into the ocean can make difference
Only once when you leave me I do pray
For you to receive these words I want to say
Can't turn back time  I know that well
What will it be when the time will come for me
Through hell I will go with you
Straight to the other side
Look at me burning
Look at me burning
You can change it all in every passing moment
Play a little game with fate
Survive the bitter days
Verily I say to you
I'm so much tired of this
Without you there's no me
Semper fi for eternity
Through hell I will go with you
Straight to the other side
Look at me burning
Look at me burning
It's only
One moment
You fall asleep
I'm burning
Suffocating without air I'm in flames
Suffocating without air I'm in flames
I hereby announce the state of emergency
Only now you can alter history
It's time to save this world
Break the downward spiral
Abort the process
Of desensitization in us
Come to me
Here and now
Hurricane
Verily I say to you
Believe me or not
No one will lead us
Apart from our hearts
Let's bury hysteria
Let's drown the fear and numb the pain
And put our faith in ourselves
Right Now
It's time to abort the countdown to extinction
This is killing me
Destroys
This is me  buried alive
This is me  burdened by guilt
I am guilty  I am sick and tired
I descend to hell  it boils with sinners
Killing me
This is me  buried alive
This is me  I'm guilty
This is me  burnt to ashes
This is me  forever impaired
The most significant scar of mine
Imprinted in my memory forevermore
All stained with blood I want to clean my wounds
Verily I say to you I'm ruined
Killing me
This is me  buried alive
This is me  I'm guilty
One of us
Deeper inside my deepest mind
I will break the silence
Ignite flame awake the anger
No No
Died the songs of glee
Why Why
Love hymns ceased to be
Taste the bitter and sour
Experience sadness and tears
Feel the sudden gust of wind
Violent storm is near
Look at them look at these millions cry
Ignite fire
Ignite fire
Simply tell me that you want the same
Simply tell me that you want the same
Ignite fire
Deeper inside my deepest mind
I yearn to be free of sinner's stain
No No
Died the songs of glee
Why
Why
Love hymns ceased to be
Blood spills so slowly
Even slower does the hope rebore
Verily I say to you
It is still not too late
I will rise break the chains
I know I will
Ignite fire
Ignite fire
Simply tell me that you want the same
Simply tell me that you want the same
Ignite fire
Uncovering the cards
One of them is my heart
Go
All of what I have
I would give away
For the assurance
That you're here to stay
Anything you want
You can have at once
If you show me who you really are
Unveil your face to me
No
Every another day I contemplate
Whether to trust or not Question's the same
So many deep scars
Mark my weary heart
Wounds inflamed so hot
That no tear will make it stop
Rest is all I need
So assure me now
That our flesh and blood is forever bound
Unveil your face to me
No
Every another day I contemplate
Whether to trust or not Question's the same
Verily I say to you apprize these words
This is
My promise to you
Hell is one step behind us
We vanish into its blaze
Whatever it may be
I know a part of it
Solitude I curse myself
Tormented by conscience
Bastions of the wicked blinded mob yeah
Armies of those deprived of banners
Imprisoned suffering soul
Condemned there I cried alone
Verily I say to you
This is too much to take
For a soul like me like you
Torn
I begged alone I begged alone
Torn
Alone
Solitude I curse myself
Tormented by conscience
I've seen faces of agonized
I've seen their dirty bloodstained hands
Imprisoned suffering soul
Condemned there I cried alone
Not worthy enough I can't speak about it
Contemplation is all that I have left
Torn
I begged alone I begged alone
Torn
alone
When you're full of misery
When you despise yourself or think
That others despise you
it's then when you take revenge
Yeah
When you fall down in shame
You see the true image of yours
Will haunt you till the end
You won't change this no you can't
When you will hear your own cry
Filled with pain and misery
Only then will you realize
That you have lost this game
You
Remove these bonds
You incinerate existence
Into the ashes into dust
You put your teeth so deeply
I almost feel I cannot live
Inhaling this berserkly
New chapter I'm starting today
And when the mist will leave
Shadows unveil me
I scream
Farewell
I don't want to see your tears
I scream
Farewell
Just stay where you are
This is your funeral
No roses lying on the grave
No trumpets filling the air
No chanting angel choir
Verily I say to you
Senselessly you do act
And this few outcried words
Have no real worth
I scream
Farewell
I don't want to see your tears
I scream
Farewell
Just stay where you are
Make no moveDeus ex machina
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was hardly nothing left
But a bare and sore ground
Lite a stripped and dried out soul
Without body and skin
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
And the cold wind blew the hazel trees
Reminding them of how old they are
Suddenly a force from above
Silenced the elegy
It was at the end of the day
It was at the end of the day
Deus ex machina
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
There was a last sudden gust of wind
Before the life and freshness again
Touched every heart mind and soul
And the comfortable summer breeze
Played with the green leaves of the hazel trees
Reminding them of how young
And beautiful they are
Echoing a sorrowless future to come
They thought about their lives
How satisfying they were
And they spoke with happy childlike voices
After ten rainy summers
And nine destructive winters
Deus ex machina
She's the month of June
A summer's tune
The wind that blows
The flower that grows
She'll forever be
So proud and free
A firefly
The sun in the sky
And forever she'll dance
It's the summer
Of her days and forever
Her heart is yours
In the heart of Juliet
One love she won't forget
She longs to give
Forever live
Her soul has such desire
She needs to love admire
A tide to the shore
Searching for more
No vale of tears
No hauting fears
Another birth
She's joy on earth
Dancing like a child
So pure and wild
A virgin rose
She longs to be close
I can find no sleep  I never sleep at night
I stop counting sheep  I can see their eyes
And the lights will shine all night tonight
And the lights will shine tonight
Some will cover me  some choose to bite
Then I will come to life  I can guarantee that
I will come to life
Won't you come with me  I can ease your mind
Dreams thoughts fantasies keep rushing by
I can find no sleep  I never sleep at night
All those pretty sheep sit mesmerized
Then I will come to life  I can guarantee that
I will come to life
Into these silent waves of all times  eternally
How long may this remain
Peace to the land
Nature and sea
Silent emotions are overcome
I wonder how
We can go on
Stormy times will we behold
Do we still care
What future holds
So many words been said undone
The waves of green
They will flow on
Heal me free me  dawning is near
Where is the saviour  for us to believe
As I sit here  on Norge's shores
Cries of the unheard  will they be heard
The waves of green  whispering my name
When the sun was down
I opened my eyes
And I looked around
All the stars were bound
To fall from the sky
I would make no sound
Take good care
Take good care
I can hold you
And console you
I can show you another rainbow
Take good care  I can make you one
I can hold you
Like I told you
I can fold you another rainbow
Take good care  I can make you one
Where's that distant light 
There used to be one
Once we used to lie
Under the sun
All the things that I
Would treasure have gone
Now I'm satisfied
I can hold you
And console you
I can show you another rainbow
Take good care  I can make you one
I can hold you
Like I told you
I can fold you another rainbow
Take good care  I can make you one
Je har ei tulle med oyne bla
Med silkear og med orer sma
Og midt i fjeset en liten nese
Sa stor som sa
Good vibes bad vibes  dance on the ocean
Manmade insanity's holding me down
Good vibes bad vibes  a way of locomotion
I can show you I can show you all around
Blue light red light  drink a magic potion
Onetrack eternity's making me frown
Blue light red light  bitter sweet emotion
Won't you send me way up the underground
Hold tight uptight waiting for the sunlight
All my enemies are watching me drown
Hold tightm uptight  I'm on the wrong side
I'm on camp site waiting on a silver cloud
Good vibes bad vibes  dance on the ocean
Manmade insanity's holding me down
Good vibes bad vibes  a way of locomotion
This place where evil seems to reign
The land has drowned in chaos
An unknown power is commanding this domain
Enter this mortal land
Inhale the smell of death
Watch the fallen victims
Crawl into this endless pain
Coldness is surrounding the landscape
Darkness is hunting the air
The ground trembles in thunder
Death is now serving everywhere
The Gatekeepers are holding the obscured key
They keep order on faith and reality
Guarding the mystical demonic gate
As sand springs to dust she opens the gate
On black bones of tombstone she lies in her bed
Beyond the seven gates she must travel
To overtake the mighty underworld domain
Ereshkigal's face gloomed up her rage
The throne on which she stands
Trained by the souls of the dead
Tortured by the sister and the beast
Feasted on her own sweat and blood
She rules the dark part of Eden
Eden
Trained by the souls of the dead
Tortured by the sister and the beast
Feasted on her own sweat and blood
She rules the dark part of Eden
Inhaling the aurora of despair
Crawling in dimness and pain
Like a cold gasp from the absence
The pestilence is here yet again
Shades Of Misery
Shades Of Misery
Time stands still
The dim light in horizon has faded
The winds of the sea has gone
Coldness is left behind
The sun has found better places
Wolves howl in fear
Their castle is a throne of shadow
Their lust isn`t mentioned in words
Ancient wisdom reigns
Our fathers has awakened
Sorcery written in blood
A torch breaks the addicting silence
A shape of forgotten times is rising
Life is long gone
Even ice is freezing
You have seen them in the eyes
You can smell their terror inside
With shapened blades they fight
The warriors of northern twilight
Sons of serpent chaos
They ride the wings of sorrow
They mourn to heed their dead
Driven by their lust
The dead rise in fear
Scholared by immortality
Rulers of black moonlight
Rulers of illuminative kingdoms
We shall never forget
They`ll make us forgive
Shadows of aurora
They attack where we can`t defend
In our dreams they take us in hand
With pride they kill
Demonized they are
You have seen them in the eyes
You can smell their terror inside
With shapened blades they fight
The warriors of northern twilight
We feel cold
We are loosing our dreams
We have been vanquished
By the warriors of northern twilight
Of bloodwork and pain
And revelation to thy nine worlds beyond
Of lunacy from an archheretic
And failed believes from thy mortal souls 
I am thy savage guard
Thy keeper of thy ninth gate of Ishtar
I conduct all your wishes and lusts
I am Mephisto himself 
In a bed of roses and wine
Thou whilst shed your last tears in life
When hell freezes finally over
Blood will be shed in twilight of October 
Of Blizzard winds and frost
And absence of love and celebrating survey
We envy thy beasts that fell
Into thy gloomy freezing pits of hell 
I am thy savage guard
Thy keeper of thy ninth gate of Ishtar
I conduct all your wishes and lusts
I am Mephistophilus himself 
As we all where afflicted
By thy sacred beliefs thy spiritual flesh
A highpriest of hell
Declared war of savage and sorrow 
I mourn as I drink their purified blood
Of servitude and labor it taste
Thy dismal sorrow lies in freezing hell
Oh what a pity what a horrible waste 
All our losses all our pain
Afflicted by thy way they all where slain
Our glory our tremedious feast
Their defeat in thy eyes of thy beast 
I am thy savage guard
Thy keeper of thy ninth gate of Ishtar
I conduct all your wishes and lusts
I am Mephostophiel himself 
Time whilst celebrate
In a world of blister and torture
Where all life has decayed
When hell freezes over 
I am thy savage guard
Thy keeper of thy ninth gate of Ishtar
I conduct all your wishes and lusts
I am Satan himselfSun  Creator of life
Gives an energy and inspires the brave
Resist Question
Pay with everything you have but be saved
Moon  Romantic and delicate
I lost myself in elation
Her light leads me to ecstasy
Owls worship her
Sometimes I wonder looking at the stars
Are we the only souls in human form
Contending with three poisons of mind
Is it only here where happiness is love
and reason for suffering ignorance
Sun  A maker of life
Moon  Romantic and delicate
I turn to sun to brighten my mind each day 
I turn to sun to brighten my mind
For ages human imagination
To our mother Earth
Peace of masses is constantly disrupted
Karma of humanity in form of wars
Suggested lies take control over life
Trigger anxiety leading to a radical obsession
When I close my eyes I wonder how long
our mother's heart will withstand human cruelty
We won't find the answer in books of wisemen
as the answer lies in us
I feel hunger desire to explore her naked body
Something free from the city's sickness calls me
My desire is increasing
together with stars on the sky
You make my problems disappear I become focused
Your grace flows on my shoulders
You make me wonder if I deserve all this
Maybe I cross God's law
Entering new lands of the night
I'm afraid I won't make it 'till morning
I think I can't fight the will to explore
You make my problems disappear
Your grace flows on my shoulders
You make me wonder if I deserve all this
Maybe I cross God's law
Don't bother the signs on earth
Only those in the sky show the path
Everything's different there
Air broadens perspectives
It's the time to climb up high
It's time to feel freedom
Imagination won't do
Your eyes need enlightment
Don't ask questions without answers
You have to experience to believe
Don't hesitate why should you
The space needs your peace
It's the time to climb up high
It's time to feel freedom
Imagination won't do
Your eyes need enlightment
It's time  Time 
Someone once told me that forgive is to suffer
Every day I watched him destroy his life
I even learned to live with it
I learned to live with hope
But when But when
The end came The end came
Despite the pain I rubbed in me
I didn't want my suffering to end
Why can't I run away from your anger
It's just love and sense of my blame
So please don't tell me now that you need me
Let me get my colours back
Why can't I run away from your anger
It's just love and sense of my blame
So please don't tell me now that you need me
Why can't I
I and many things to which there is no answer
I and a beautiful mirror in a glow of azure hues
Time seems to be passing faster
Maybe we will forget about the harm done by fate
And I can feel I'm flying lonely
Drifting in colors of my emotions
I make constant journeys of my mind
Falling asleep in the clouds of words
I can feel everything flourishing
And he always tells me to fight
And he always tells me to try
But in fact he doesn't know how much we differ
Can feel I'm flying lonely
Drifting in colors of my emotions
Through the rivers of my thoughts which no ship
Colorful lights twinkle in my eyes
They make me feel unusually safe
Things which I've never experienced
surround me from all sides
And suddenly it calls me tempts me with its song
I fly among golden clouds
in a forsaken heaven where no one can find me
The wounds of past disappear
Healed with  with invisible magic of new days
They need a confidant they need someone
who will lead them through the other side
I have a feeling their eyes are blind
Minds stained with time
Killing worlds is beauty
Not able to catch its meaning
But you are different
You save me from hell
But you are different
Take me inside you
Why are they so far from truth
Why won't they get out of cages
I could help you if you want
We would admire blue horizon
Why are they so far from truth
Why won't they get out of cages
Look at them
They're like ash like faded stars on the sky
Yet there's hope
There's a chance they don't know how to reach
And forget who you were
And forget you ever saw them
You need to run run from the dark past
And forget who you were
And forget you ever saw them
Spirit of age come to me please
And forget who you were
And forget you ever saw them
Entangled in the world of illusions we create
Like a parasite like a poison hidden deep inside
Possession as an essence
Absorb Devour It's a drug
It's death in a mindless delight
Bored lonely and greedy
We wouldn't make it without desires
But when everything is gone
Emptiness will wail for drops
Madness that will come out of oceans
On scorched ground spilled with salt and grief
New beginning will come just for a while
So that makes the circle complete
and alongside I leave
filled with hope for a new time
The circle's complete Walk on my rainchild
so pure and waiting for the dawn
walk on my rainchild to god
Go on my redsky
so sure and longing for your spawn
go on my deadsky my god
Rape me
Blame me    
Hate me
Feed me but it's not worth dying for
on your walk outside my door
see it's all you love me for
I'm the god you were before 
So cry a sad smile
as frail as morpheous and sweet
so cry a dead smile to god
Rape me
Blame me    
Hate me
Feed me but it's not worth dying for
on your walk outside my door
see it's all you love me for
I'm the god you were before
Sore am I calling the pyre
pure and light deep down the mire
So goodnight my firefly dancer
wear the light the fire will take your
Heart and love you
heart and drown you
heart and leave you
a sun to carry me home
frail am I free from desire
old and wise my god and so tired
So goodbye my surface dancer
in your light the fire did take my
Heart and loved you
heart and drowned you
heart and burned you
my sun come carry me home
for this bleeding sunwalk
we laid down besides
and a screaming sky walks
and a trigger by my side
drowing karmic networks
sad machines inside
see the radio sky talks
under a searing heaven
swallow
swallow    
swallow
swallow the bitter taste you once craved deep
your christ your veil your sun
in bitter blood you lay your sleep
and keep the sun in turn 
for my god my cancer
my painful god alone
dream of plastic serpents
swallowed father take me home
close my stranded eyes now
kiss my sun goodbye
light this jesus lantern
crack my searing heaven
swallow
so leave in morpheous dreams
lay down crestfallen eyes
no sad farewell in plastic flowers
take this breath away from harm
as once a child in kaleidoscope mind
swallow
Deep down the line
sleep save my child
trains leave and come
sad dreams ain't long {they said}
And they dream tonight
I always wanted the war
and they sleep tonight
dying in yearning for more
Deep down the spine
sleep save my child
loves leave and come
all is said and done
And they dream tonight
I always wanted the war
and they sleep tonight
dying in yearning for more
And they dream tonight
once they all wanted the war
now we sleep tonight
worn out and dreaming no more
You carried roses and a nail under the red
you carried roses as the odium in hands
will you remember a sundown in the sand 
Far beyond the waves you carried
far beyond your sunblind eyes
far beyond the war you buried
before the sun died
we carried roses and a nail under the red
we carried roses as the odium in hands
as we corrode on wipe the rust into your hair
Far beyond the waves you carried
far beyond your sunblind eyes
far beyond the war you buried
before the sun died
Far beyond the waves you carried
far beyond your sumblind eyes
far beyond the love you carried
you long for sunlight
Water water prevail my searing landscape
water water relieve my pain and let me in
fire fire paint all your flames on my skin
fire fire burn deep and purify my sin
water water take on your child for dying
father father I know I promised you to swim
I am the plastic you adore
I am the nail to hold your door
I am the light you ll never find
I am the sun of far gone times
I am the sun of far gone life
I am the plastic you adore
I am the nail to hold your door
I am the light you ll never find
I am the sun of far gone times
I am the sun of far gone life
I am the plastic you adore
I am the nail to hold your door
I am the light you ll never find
still I'm the sun of far gone times
still I'm the sun of far gone life
maybe they will care
sometimes I wish it would never end
sometimes I wish I couldn't care
sometimes I feel like I'd never see you again
take a walk on an autumn night
inhale the stars and drown in their gleam
does it really take dying children
to see what makes the world go round
but as long as I can drown in my own
I guess I won t give a fuck anyway
I'm drowning I'm drowning for you
leaving the waves I unscrew
a long night and again I adore you
a long night and the radio plays
I'm bleeding I'm bleeding for you
breathing the rape I once knew
someone but somehow it hurts you
someone in my radio plays
and so we run hurry to drown again
and so we run to dream of the same
and so we're gone turned out and down again
and so we run to go down in flames
So close the water
so cold the fire
so sleep away the coma be your home
corrode and smile you're not alone
So deep the water
so free the fire
so go away the radio calls your name
{I think} you know their names were all the same
jade in milky green parade
a teardrop carved in smile
jade behold the sun I made
a deep embracing pride
help me carry the raindrops
break me hurry to rape on
hold on drag me away god
drown me buried in raindrops
jade in flames of haunting grey
as like a lonely mourn
jade come bleed inside of me
as long as I'm not torn
help me carry the raindrops
break me hurry to rape on
hold on drag me away god
drowned me buried in raindrops
melt the snow in my lies
melt the magic in my eyes
what I m searching for
what I m living for
 I forgotI see no reason to live this life
It's seems to be lost and bleak
A pale reflection is all thats left
Of the shine I once had
I've lost it all but my pain
And it never leaves me be
Ever since the cradle to the grave
I will live this life in hell
I'm not the one with those empty words
I'm sick of all your lies
I trusted you but you betrayed
You stole my pride with your love
Pushed aside down the soil
I cant struggle no more
I guess I'll never understand why
You hurt me with your lies
I gave you my heart but you took my soul
And you just threw it away
I have lost my pride I'm an empty shell
Covered with scars and open wounds
I were never yours to cherish or love
I cannot still forget your emptiness
The pain in my heart which you did cause
It will never go away how much i try
I cannot escape this pain
This was the final fatal blow of indifference
Which were buried beneath the foundation of lies
All that we had were simply shattered
There's no turning back no soothing of pain
The fever that rages overturnes control
Now when my world comes tumbling down
I stumble blindly towards the end
Inside of me there's only hatred and sin
A demonic being that is feeding on me
I feel so numb by this tainted life
I'm a silhouette invisible
Like an autumn leaf I will wither away
I declare this my silent end
The plague evolve until life has ceased
I succumb and my spirit dissolve
It's another day and another sorrow
A life in pain the pain is mine
Like an endless torture
That's tearing me apart
Rip my soul to shreds
Just reap what I have sown
I'm the bitter selfcaged man
With demons clinging unto me
I have lost my sympathy
This burden dies with me
As time goes by it's raping my mind
I got suicide thoughts I want to end it now
Don't think I'm bothered if you are sad
If you are drowning it's me who pull you down
You say you're sorry but I don't care
You're all alone without my sympathy
Well I'm sick and tired of all your complains
You're not the only one with a tortured soul
Who wants to hear the story of your life
One more word and I'll ease your pain
Behind the mask my bitter face
All emotions seems to be numb
You are heading for the fall
My desire is your misery
I cant forgive how much I try
I cant forget even if I want
The shame the guilt  let go of the burden
I swallow my pride I erase my thoughts
From cradle to grave Now reconcile
One last crusade a final burden
I carried the cross to the hill
To face my bitter end
One final breath before redemption
My soul demised from its womb
As my body was drained from blood
From the wounds in my hollow soul
I will bleed until I am dead
Then I transform into another shape and fly away
Pardon me if I rape an angel on my way
My soulless body has been erased and deleted
I'm so afraid
But I'm prepared for the worst
I keep crying myself to sleep
Forever gone all I loved is lost
I'm sinking deeper and deeper down
I'm sinking deeper and deeper down
It's like they say misery loves company
After my demise
I adore the tranquil silence
My visions are lost
It ain't nothing left but memories
I cannot be what you want
I will not preserve your image
Whatever pain you may bring
I cant feel your curse
Cause all the little pieces of me
Will turn the truth from your lies
I wont crave forgiveness
You keep tearing me blind
Of all the selfishness
You could be the image of me
From failure of detonation
I'm caged forever trapped
I will never be free I cant control my mind
I hear your screams so alive
Tears of regret stings my eyes I just want to be
One single heartbeat away from you
And your lies
Infectious bleeding
You're turning me insane
This I cannot comprehend
My hatred grows
Cause all the little pieces of me
Will turn the truth from your lies
I wont crave forgiveness
you keep tearing me blind
I will speak no more of my feelings
Cause they seem to disappear
From failure to termination
In my mind my all gone
Will it break the silence will it open my heart
Will it turn my face towards the sun
To feel the passion to feel the joy
And lay my fears to die
I hear my voice screaming your name
I'm ready to fall into the black
Now I'll die
In this fallen kingdom there's a sacred path
A secret trail only known by the gods
Here lies the wisdom to eternal life
Within the shrine the powers are sealed
This is the threshold to my dreams
As I opened the chest to immortality
I inherit the force of life and death
The secret is revealed for me
This was a legacy from the gods
Unable to endanger human intimacy
Radiation roams the world freed
Torn out of cenvenience
Fear turns to bravery
Bravery turns to stupidity
Freed radiation
Temperature increases with proximity
Dosimeter failed  the path is laid
Matrix Shock
Molecule Dissection  gamma radiation nemesis
Matrix shock  No cover
Now comes the punishment
For feeling like Kings
Overestimated sience
Ingenuous and myopic
Human fulfill the greed
The path is laid
You can''t become a master
When you're born a slave
End of all
Layers of wave reflection
In the shadow of its origin
Blast furnace of sun
Forge of electrons in the
Outer shell of atoms
Positive charge excess
Erased adversed electrons floating detached
Global charge transported
Conduction of cosmic tension
Block 4  artificial radiation source
The human failure
Memorial of the doomed
Uprising radiation
Out of the earth extraction point
Is charging the spheres
The reactor  exit core  devastation site
Increased amount in the circulation
Radioactivity is been reflected back to earth
Ionosphere  horrid eruption flare
Moving ground poles  friggering earthquakes
Perish all living  ridding the decline
Global negation  end of the line
Vaporizing the dim aurora of life
Transient phenomena  fade out of earth
Complete blackout
Humanity  bred on deceit
Visionaries  in their own universe of voidness
What I do not see has no existence
Obligation is my conviction
Conviction is the driving force
Directed by unawareness
Unable to gaze into outward
To the endless beyond all senses
Predominance of the atom
Equation of existence
Nullifying all foreign
Devouring the oppressing one
What is unaware is bessed
What is alive is finite
We do not know it
We know nothing
Space time spheres and nothing
As a concentration of sources
Related elements
Predictions are not possible
Its chaos
In this labile system
Minor variation induce a serious aftermath
Math reigns the system of chaos
The disposal of events is feigned
Math reigns the system of chaos
Some events seem to happen casual
And the relations between
All is chaos  chaos is all
Suffer from unknown deprivation
Dismay potentation through the stupidity
Converting unawareness into conviction
Persistence of risk perception
Killing of trust
Perish in numbness
Dead eyes are staring forth
Framing effect
Selfreinforcing mistrust
Defending itself against rationality
The time has come to sort out the blind
Refuse to submit  dread of betrayal
Dread of cowardice  betrayal
The time has come to sort out
Now we look out of a fragile muted earth
Children born not to survive
Mutated into nonhumankind
Is this fear of radiation or it is a fear of war
Are just can be used for lightning fires
Even for that use they won't serve long
Atoms enter new connections  adopting new forms
Summarized material can't be destroyed
The time has come to sort out the blind
Refuse to submit  dread of betrayal
Dread of cowardice  betrayal
The time has come to sort out
Helicopter will manage the distance
Proceed to next objective  standard command
Check the satellite scans for a barren spot
In the devastation
Sun is rising on the horizon
Flooding the land with color and life
Take a grip to withstand the strong wind
Dead land is passing by
Reaching the army of pines
Instant infantry stand tight
Shield prypjat from the threat
Absorbing prime emmision
A place of nothingness among the devastation
A place of nothingness thats left for revocation
Instant infantry stand tight
Shield prypjat from the threat
Absorbing the prime emission
Complete absorption
GUARD THE CITY  with a solid green skin
SHILD THE CITY  in bleeding orange
Proceed to next objective
Eternal autumn sector within the fertile nature
Radio active shock  bio collapse  sudden decline
Disassembly the trees during contamination
Fallen buried offduty
Nothing will grow again
Incident legacy  the nature inherits emptiness
A place of nothingness among the devastation
Sun sinks in the horizon
Revoking color and life
Take a grip to withstand the strong wind
Dead land is passing by
Leaving the army of pines
Instant infantry stand tight
Shield prypjat from the threat
Absorbing prime emission
All getting absorbed
Antennas rust slowly squeak in the wind
Thousands tons of metal  high alloy steel
150 meters  zinc layer prevent it from corroding
My mind accept what the eyes won't believe
Rise  over the forest
Rise  to the sky
A smoldering fire pit warms my cold dead hands
Horizon  the north trace
Horizon  antenna arrays  dead place
I am one of 300 still live in the exclusion zone
The singing of the dead brings me to rest
No grave wreaths no plastic flowers
Only the yellowblack triangular radiation signs
Prypjat
Cargo port crane cemetry
I pick one of the cabins
Surmount the endless
Leader to reach a hight
With less radiaton
300
Heirs of downfall
Dead population
Endstage of doom
Dwelling in the ruins
Singing of the dead
Drowning populace of the invalid
Fallout progeny
Suffer severe sickness  vascular rearrangement
And cardiovascular disorders
Common frailty
Children die of cardiac infarction
The young have friable bone marrow like the aged
No cure against
No acceptance
No medication
Infinity  irrelevance
Reality  ampuation
Diversity  divergence annihilation
Poverty is laming provision
Benumbing of all  zero thought
No acceptance
No medication
Irrelevance and amputation
Infinity  just irrelevance
Reality  amputation
Diversity  divergence annihilation
Generation one  muted silent inconspicuous
Suffering grows
Drowning populace of the invalid
Fallout progeny
No acceptance
No medication
Irrelevance and amputation
Infinity irrelevance
Reality  amputation
Diversity divergence annihilation
Suffering grows
Horrid genome distortion
Unseen the suffering grows inside
Along with the guiltless pure newcomers
Innocent atonement is the ultimate sin
Door shut down
With a grating sound
Group of men surrounded
By complete darkness
In the pale glint of the headlamps
Grey concrete
Structures peel from the twilight
Into the heat
A motionless cloud of dust forms a fatal mist
Endless corridors countless cables
Useless devices shattered pipes
Passage is blocked
Interior rooms demolished
In spite of the massive preparation
The burden of inability
Descended on them with the
First step they did
The whole previous life of the men
Is left before the door lock
Septum between before and now
The sense of duty towards humanity
Leads them to move on
Displays drop out
Xvalues beyond all
Under the gas mask they can hardly breathe
Men of honor are afraid to stumble
Mask begins to melt
Crawl to proceed
No one would come
For corpse retrieval
Trudge through the radioactive grit
Buried under the sarcophagus
Shattering streams of charged particles
Creating fields with massive neutron activity
Atom for peace
Rest in dust
Atom for peace
Rest in dust
Foundation load exceeded reliable load by far
The whole core energy penetrates to the outside
Everything in the way is getting disintegrated
Undead molten masses which no scientist knows
Ancient horror settled in the ruin
Reaching with his fiery breath 
For the hearts of men
Blackness of night grey dawning
Filtering filth comatose reaction
Spasmatic thrashing vociferous feeding
Cancerous affliction perpetual bleeding
Sucking lesions black with decay
Infections contamination
Death  a suicide away
Splitting switches writhing in agony
Screaming coughing up blood
Voices within infernal cacophony
Plaything of the dead
Butchered alive
Obscene fantasies dance in your head
Running shadows creep from behind
Peripheral horrors bide their time
Sanity's bled dreams of the dead
Dreams of the dead
Dreams of the dead
Dreaming death life in fragments
Haunting visions hallucinatory premonition
Living in real lies a waking contradiction
Sphere of pain life's weak promise
Curtain call for you
Death remembers your name
A thousand memories fight for your soul
Disembodied entities so long without control
Lust for life playground of the dead
Taste for morbidity apocalyptically fed
Running shadows creep from behind
Peripheral horrors bide their time
Sanity's bled dreams of the dead
Dreams of the dead
Dreams of the dead
Twilight of the old age
Post mortem report
Bacteria not contained
Slaughterhouse step inside
Torrential bloodbath
Stalking death in pride
Your death is now complete
As you're forced through agony again
Frustration and hatred
Contaminate my view
Dreaming my mind is in silence
As insanity prevails my every move
Fade from reality
Such pain interminable suffering
I remember the rain storm coming
The shadows of the clouds racing
Like the thoughts in my mind
Fade from reality
Such pain interminable suffering
I remember the rain storm coming
The shadows of the clouds racing
Like the thoughts in my mind
And I remembered blood and agony
Screaming at me like a chorus of the damned
Dreaming my mind is in silence
As insanity prevails my every move
My view is losing focus
A haze of reality slowly fades
Awoken to this hell
My souls release only a matter of days
And neverending seem to be this way
Someone stole the fire
The only light in this painful way
This is the sound of misery
Sometimes the life looks so scary
Looking for desire during the whole life time
The world turned to fire
Please open your eyes
The time slowly whispers my unspoken words
The hearts still beating and reality hurts
The old wound still bleeding
And my mind still suffocates the pain
I cannot stop my feelings
Expendable is the last word to say
This is the sound of misery
Sometimes the life looks so scary
Drops of rain are washing my face
I am trying to look around
Following the shadow I slowly closed the day
I sowed my face
Im still the same
Following the shadow from life what remains
Here comes the day
Im still insane
Listening to the warning warning of the past
Nobody is talking theres left to trust
Embraced by the screaming of damned youth
And I still dont know why
Why do you cry So lonely
Poor root of religion dismembered by time
The spirit has own reasons to enter the calm
Sooth locus of rapture where no life dwells
Dawn of the madness the earth is part of hell
The world is dying
And mankind is bleeding
From the deep space
The Nibiru arrive
People are hunted
For their own meanings
For such a long time
The gobernment still lie
World is buried
I dont cry
All my warnings
Are drowning in lies
Selective feelings
4 alternative healing
Who protect the secret
When Nibiru arrives
The bells start ringing
And life is leaving
Chance for the humans
Maybe the next time
Heavy clouds on the sky
For the earth left
The last goodbye
Damnation of mankind
The same mistake
For thousand times
I am screaming
To the night
I am flying
To the sky
I am bleeding
For my wounds
I am dying
On the earth
So blue is the sky
No one left
For whom the sun shines
Lifeless way
Through the space
Death is all what now remains
Thick fog in the land is summoning the end
Death will appear soon accompanied with Doom
Shadows rushed by wind the Fairy softly sings
The melody is well known its the call of beyond
Despair is in the air and the blaze from nowhere
Last message of light in kingdom of the night
Last breath of dying world for escape no time
Everything is forgotten under sand of time
The sun denies to come madness is all around
To clean all what left sometimes its the best
Silver moon on the winter sky
Wolfs howling is greeting the night
Loneliness and the endless time
Are the only friends in restless life
In a last time the saltly taste of blood
This memory diappeared in the past
Hundred years under famous names
Fame is gone just solitude stays
Hearing screams of all dead victims
Pictures come back to you
Hearing screams of all dead victims
Hunger is back to you
Now is the time for VAMPIRIAN BLUES
Abandoned castle hidden in the hills
Thick forest and strange whisperings
Nameless one arrived with the wind
Our world is really made for him
Priest are screaming on the knees
The serpents time becomes
Maybe the God has no time to listen to you now
Follow the way
Holding mother
Follow the way
Follow the way
Knew we'd come through to stay
What have I learned
All life it never goes away
You never will betray
When words have gone away
Remember ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂNamasteÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ
Follow the way
Follow the way
Holding father
Feeding the feeling of
Feeding the feeling of
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂOh my GodÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ
All life it never goes away
You never will betray
When words have gone away
Remember ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂNamasteÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ hey hey
yeah lets go
let it go 
All life it never goes away
You never will betray

Slow slow

Home grown surrey weed
Now I'm running I'm running Im
It follows me to empty mind
It follows me
Falling watching ships go down
Falling watch it all go down
Falling out of line
Falling out of time
More than meets the eye
Murder needs your mind
Watching watch it all flow down
Falling watch it all go down
Following by sight
Following through night
More than a keen eye
Murder needs you
So you're not the only one child
And the battle must be won child
When the seed is in the ground
You will see what you have found
So let them burn so let them fires burn
It's tattooed on my face
So let them burn just let them go
Uh
Now you're not the only one child
Many battle have been won child
Beyond the sea be on the ground
You will seize or you will drown ohoh
So let them burn so let them fires burn
It's tattooed on my face
So let them burn just let them go ohuh
Wouh
Life is nothing
This life is nothing
The rain is one
Of earth and sun
For you and me and everyone
The move is on
The way is long
The pain is here but still we carry on
I know you
At least I think I do
Everything's changed
But in the days that are so dark
Wonderful
It's wonderful
It's wonderful
It's wonderful
Wonderful
It's wonderful
It's wonderful
It's wonderful
Quietly we let our worries be
Silently we give our souls to the sea yeah
But I never really had a chance to say goodbye
You know I never had a chance to end it all
Silently carefully quietly
Uh ohuh
Silently we set our worries free
Quietly we give our souls to the sea
Silently we set our worries free
Quietly we give our souls to the sea
What have we learned
From this wee exercise
What have we earned
Now that it's over
What can we say
What are we doing here
Everything's changed
Everything's stayed the same
But it's quiet now quiet now
'Cause it's the end of the world
Quiet now quiet now
'Cause it's the end of the world
Quiet now quiet now
The end of the world
Quiet now quiet now
End of the world
What if we've changed
What if we're finished here
Can we be saved
Does anybody even care
So many dreams
So many make the grade
So many fail
So many fade away
But it's quiet now quiet now
'Cause it's the end of the world
Quiet now quiet now
'Cause it's the end of the world
Quiet now quiet now
The end of the world
Quiet now quiet now
End of the world

Ahhahhah

I gonna meet you on down beside the bayou 
The bayou
The bayou
The bayou
The bayou
The bayou
The bayou
The bayou
The bayouForsaken in past passages
Told through the eyes of legends
Follow the gravel road
You can feel it grow within yourself
Feel it spread thickening
Your clearest thought may betray you
It's your death within a toll
Clear the lands of this darkened shade
Save yourself enriched in the clutched hands
Its darling touch yes is very deceiving
Beyond this village a stream to cleanse yourself
Time passes by
Deteriorate fine young man
Withered in death's time frame
Capture the descent in departure
You can feel it grow within yourself
Feel it spread thick
Realization of her imminent demise
Reflections of horror begin to fill her eyes
Devour this heart with memories of her
Indulging on her flesh
In this ceremony of butchery
Gazing upon blood stained hands
Insanity overcomes me
Nails seem to rain from the sky
A curse upon the common man
To be chosen to disrupt this harmony
A glimpse into the future
Breathe in the blackened sky
Feel as the insects fill your lungs
Their reproduction
Nails seem to rain from the sky
A curse upon the common man
To be chosen to disrupt this harmony
An honor only to the spiteful
To be chosen to reign but reign I will
Clawing out my own eyes for yesterdays shadows
Paint vivid pictures of lustful punctures
In a time when two blood types coalesce
Smiles will never be so shallow again
Curse of emotionality has been cast upon thee
Thine essences sank in immaterial unreality
The immortals guard the mystery of the flux
Nothing moves in magic creation of every dawn
Burns planetary systems by its deadly mass
Thus all civilizations shall be destroyed
By the infinite wisdom of ye nature
For thine omnipresent inequity
Never the less I shall try to save thee
If you feel what I feel it wont be you anymore
With your phobia to know the consciousness
Neither a few like me do comprehend
I hunger to experience the one of yours
Universes in the sphere of space  time continuum
You left our souls abandoned left all alone
We have strived we really tried for better lives
Foes are awating us they're about to die
Vanish in killing air while our army attacks
You are on your own to realize the truth
Fallen ostracized messiah I shall be gone now
My exodus to another realm soon shall be done
I am the one and you you shall depart this life
To know me maybe
That being seas nothing but darkest blackness
Heading to nowhere lost in the immense space
In the place where just one star was known
Supernova burnt the planet where hed grown
He shall be imprisoned forever
Alone I use the vacuity as my habitat
Belonging into elements eternal
Garden of vigour hidden to anyone's visions
Spring of space  times infinite possibilities
Silent sleeping beauty of time constancy
Chaos and order gods demons and inferior beings
When to destroy is to create
The stream of time shall flow in its own spring
When to destroy is to create
How do you feel when your god leaves you alone
How do you feel when your faith betrays you
How do you feel when you know
Ill change wonderful world to hell you live in
Who moves your steps through your weary mind
And there is no way you could reach it
Annihilate yourselves abandon me in pain
Enclosing darkness hoax of lights and shadows
Bizarre entity with a breath of solar wind
Consciousness of constructed being
The aeons are ephemeral like the universe
You are me once again
You are captured here on gaia
Virtual illusions of life memories taken away
Break the circle of ephemeral halflife
Find stolen sencses of your body
What life have you built for yourself
Rip your heart from your chest
Does it still beat in your hand
Fallen through hell and back again
Recollect with full vision
No rest each night
I am haunted by demons out of sight
Assuring me that there is no way out
All I have is measured by incapability
No way out for me if I live free of a remedy
How is this so hard to shake
I'm so willing to change
My outcry for life is swallowed by the night sky
My outcry for life is swallowed by the night sky
I'm being hopeful for once
The sunrise I seek is moments from my eyes
Gazing upon the sky
Longing for the departure of night
I'm being dragged away
Into endless night
Without putting up a fight
I owe it to myself to fight the oppression
Enduring till morning to stop it from starting
Facing my greatest fear
A fear of dying here
Dying with no air in my lungs to spare
Will I live to see the end
Will I see the sun rise
I'm being hopeful for once
The sunrise I seek is moments from my eyes
Gazing upon the sky
Longing for the departure of night
Forever
Looking towards the skyline
Towards the skyline
Forever
Awaiting the sun to rise
Waiting for the break of dawn
You've lifted the greatest burden off my life
Waking up in company of all I love
Each one of us has made the other whole
Hopeful for what my life has in store
My spirit soul and mind have come alive
Alive
Alive inside
Love has its grip on me
Two become one in His full sight
My insecurity and vulnerability wiped away
Waking up in company of all I love
Each one of us has made the other whole
Overrun by grace
Further from hate
Overrun by grace further from
I am ways away
I am further from hate
And if I fall how will I ever find the comfort
And if I fall will I ever return to You
Cannot find me a way to all that is right
I continue on I know that I will never return
Not now not ever
To paint the picture of who I am
Reinforced by my own selfdestruction
Pick yourself up off the floor
Pick yourself up off the floor
I continue on I know that I will never return
Not now not ever
This isn't a dream where I just wake up
I've hit the bottom with no rope to pull me up
To get me out
Get me out
Caught on the other side of the divide
Forever lost on this mountainside
Will I ever get off this mountainside
How can you lie through your teeth
And force your ways on all you meet
I fought and lost a battle against you before
I will watch you fall
Back in the hole from which you came from
Free of resolve
I will stand against you dark and dead
I will fight until by dying breath
Face to face with your kind
Opposing the ideals of the life I choose to lead
You're making threats to me
When You draw near I depart from the fear
When I love as You love my life is made complete
Hope is the key to answering the call
It's written on your heart
You find that all your hopes and dreams
Are dead and gone
You think each person of value
Has left you alone
You should know
Besides there's a fire burning in your eyes
That you cannot disguise
Even if you tried
Even if you tried
There's a purpose for your life you cannot hide
Burning bright
You too can be changed forever
It's written on your heart
You too can be changed forever
Will you remain as you are
I've felt your pain
I know your pain
I've felt your pain
We all make the same mistakes
We all wear the scars we've won
I too lived with the same uncertainty
But hope found me
Now you know me
Hope found a home in me
Now you know me
Hope found its home
You too can be changed forever
It's written on your heart
You too can be changed forever
Return to the start
With love in your heart
You too can be changed forever
Return to the start
With love in your heart
These words have shaped me to this day
Directed me to the path I now take
I want to be the inspiration that they need
There is no difference between you and me
Are we all woven together
Don't you feel the same
I hope you find what you are looking for
But if you doubt don't be ashamed
Tonight we're stitched the same
Cos we're all woven together
And tonight we're stitched the same
I have overcome
Every wall every inch of myself
With no hold on the ways of this world
I have conquered my inmost defeat
Now death lays dying before my own two feet
Our path was always meant to meet
Maybe not now but soon you'll see
This whitehot flame inside of me
Will scorch the earth
And everything that stands in my way
Overcome
I am no mortal
As long as this spark is within me
Is within me
As it engulfs me
It changes everything
My soul is on fire for reasons
Made certain by desires found in me
But what choice did I have
But what choice did I have
They engraved my back
With this detailed map
Showing the plan
That I should outlast
I can feel it burning under my flesh
This feeling has averted me to this very second
This moment means everything
I have come to life
Life
As it engulfs me
It changes everything
My soul is on fire for reasons
Made certain by desires found in me
My eyes are burning
My eyes are burning
My eyes are burning
My eyes are burning with desire
Scorch the earth
Scorch the earth
We have overcome
We have overcome
We have overcome
The white flame burns in me
I remember the words You said to me
Giving up is never an option
You may find it hard but they have forgotten
The love they have left is never far from them
Though this world has turned cold
I'll let the warmth embrace me
And lead me on my way home
Through these streets I roam thinking all along
Awaken the heart
We have numbed ourselves to the concept of love
Our methods may not be of ease
Though this world has turned cold
Through these streets I roam thinking all along
How can they not know
How can they not know
There's a void in us all waiting to be made full
We have numbed ourselves to the concept of love
I know I will never be alone
I will never be alone
Assured to me by the love He has shown
I will never be the same
My home is found in His embrace
An entire world at peace
Covered by grace and completely set free
The Morning Sun of Dune
The holy war's
waiting for
the morning sun 
The morning sun of Dune
there's no tomorrow
the apparation of this land and it's dream
makes me feel I've seen it before
I can taste there's life
everywhere you can find
in the desert of my life
I see it again and again
And again again again again
dark tales have brought the Dijahd
like whispering echos in the wind
and I'm a million miles from home
Traveler in time
knowing that there's no rhyme
The morning sun is near
first light of dawn is here
the morning sun is near again
The Fremen sing that
their kingdom will come
and I'm the leading one
battlefields on our crusade
filled with Sardokaurs
killing machines crying
in raising fear they're hiding
Where do we go now
So where is the way
When I'm a million miles from home
The morning sun I feel
all pain and sorrow
the apparition of my words in these days
makes me feel I've told them before
all my plans will come true
I'll control destiny
in the desert of my life
I've seen it again and again
By my dreams I must find the way
to stop the raging war
I've to choose now
I will leave
my body and see
and time will stand still
when I have to leave
my body and find
a way back to the world I love
when I'm a million miles from home
Close to insanity
beyond the realms I've been
at darkest places
I'm crying
The dragon flies
Something savage
is yearning for me
I'm waiting afraid for the night
what will be
I've lost myself
a few days ago
it's touching my soul
and a vision of past dreams comes true
Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
This town must burn now
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
the one who's been before
many times I terrorized this town
many times and here I start again
now I'm stronger and so cold
cold as ice
returning is my destiny
now I feel it's growing up in me
now I feel it's burning deep in me
I'm not what I was before
could I stop this dream
I'm a stranger to myself
and I cannot control
Welcome to dying
I don't let it out
Welcome to dying
Look to the mirror it shows what I am
Welcome to dying
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
Welcome to dying
The dragon's breath I don't let it out
I'm a savage
it's too late for me
the other side's taking control and I know
there's one way I can walk alone
or the dragon will fly
and a growing fear's all that I feel
Welcome to dying 
Can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
Spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
I spread my wings and fly away
And drive them into darkness
Forever they'll be bound
Three for the Kings of the elves high in light
Nine to the mortal which cry
Slow down and I sail on the river
Slow down and I walk to the hill
And there's no way out
Mordor
Dark land under Sauron's spell
Threatened a long time
Threatened a long time
Into the valley
I feel down
In the land so dark where I have to go
Lord of the rings
Who can tell me who I am
who I am my friend
I'm an Alien so they say
a risk to everyone
No  Tell me what do they see
No  Tell me what do they feel
No  Tell me what do they fear
No  Tell me what do they see
I'm a dwarf but I know more than you
and I'm a key to a better life
from terror I could escape
but I need your helping hand
so far from home where I'm left alone
Did you hear my crying
Did you hear my crying
Goodbye my friend
I found you at the end
I say Goodbye to all
Goodbye my friend
thanks for your helping hand
I say Goodbye to all my cries
just say Goodbye
No returning nevermore
No returning nevermore
And I'll remember
Communication to you is so strange
You trust to no one no warmths reach your heart
to you I'm the stranger but you're strange to me
You destruct all what is unknown to you
We are together now
and don't you know I'll come back again
I must go now
 Goodbye
I will go home now
I will go home now
much too long I'm forced to stay
in visions I see
so dark and so deep
mankind will destruct all life
See you again I hope I will
see you again at the end
My tortured soul can't forget the pain
now I find my way back
I WILL GO HOME NOW
I WILL GO HOME NOW
 Goodbye
Awaiting my last breath
the mirror calls my name
it's showing me the way
into the dark
the bridge appears
I jump into the dark side
and hear the voice it's cold as ice
Welcome to reality
Where am I now
Darkness surrounds
can't go forward
can't go back
 I see planets dying
 I fall into the light
 a new universe awakens
 I'm a Traveler in Time
 Pray for the light
 Where's the key
 To the gate
 of a new life  no
 I search for deliverance
 But I cannot find
Look behind the mirror
I'm lost in the twilight hall
once I'll be back for a moment in time
that's when the mirror's falling down
Take me away
from the place I've been
to another life
in another world
a sign of life
surrounds me now
the bridge appears in the dark
I'm free
I fly alone
leaving this darkness now forever
the memories of children
and the wisdom of many lifes
burns deep in me
Where will the light go to
Where will the light go to
Is this deliverance
Is it the end
 Look
I'm back there's a new chance for me
and all my memories are gone
I can feel what's happening to me
and the mirror will burst
 Look 
She's opening her eyes
to find the thing
by a touch she's lost
it's waiting for her a long time
the kingdom's lost
cause there's one nail missing
playing with fire
turn of the light
and she'll fall down
playing with her life
but she can't leave it
there's one rhyme in her brain
Oh last night and the night before
Tommyknockers Tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers
The pain in my head
the cycle awakes
I'm on my way to Oz
I want to drink and she wants to dig
she's in trouble oh I know
there's something going wrong
Tommyknockers on their way
What's up in Leighton street
Oh last night and the night before
Tommyknockers Tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
I'm the hero I'm back
with weapons and with magic spells
I'll seddle every task
an old ill and drunken guy
The moon is full of blood
I've found her not not far from home
I should better get away from here
she's on her way to be another one
playing with fire
she can read my thoughts
it's too late
playing with her life
Tommyknockers brought her trouble
The ship in the earth I touch
a vibration is filling me
and music is in my head
nose is bleeding
and my fall down
filled me with pain
you'll be like a Tommyknocker
I'll be like you
but there's something going wrong
I read it in your face
Oh last night and the night before
Tommyknockers Tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers knocked at your back door
Tommyknockers knocked at your back door
At Hilly's show
they didn't know
that the Ending of Being is near
I can feel their voices
the old man cries
Please save the boy
he's caught in a world far behind
from home
Monster Anne is crying out
Feel my pain I can't escape
Bad chances for me
Altair 4 
chosen by their whispering words
What is left behind
When purple colors turn to black
Can you feel it
Is there time
Can you see it
Is there life
Fly away and dream
Guardian Guardian Guardian of the Blind 
Have you forgotten him
Far from the land
where the sun is born
down in the wood Caladon
Do you know that place
where the light is never seen
and all hopes are turned
by the final cry
Turned to Stone 
Whispering tunes in the wind
all hopes are gone with the night
when the old man will never come back
remember his words and his songs
And we see the raven flying in the distance
but no wizard's singing his song
Somebodies out in the night
I fly in time
the last candle will burn
there's hope for everyone
when the last candle burns high
oh it's time for life
The elves and gnomes have to hide
when the moon is showing it's face
and raging orcs will set their traps
and all forests will burn
they hate green trees
and love the dark
they don't understand
that they're caught and left alone
they feel the magic in the wind
they just fear the old man's song
Somebodies
Corrupted old gnome
betrayer of all
you know so much about all
what is your price
Too much too much
you cannot pay with your silver and your gold
there's just a little chance for all you fools
now pay
And so I walk across the land
and hope to hear the wizard's song
Somebodies 
Somebodies out there
I feel there's somebody
Somebodies out there
I feel there's somebody
There comes the last part and end of our old age
the crown of the whole world
his creatures will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are meaningless  Oh no
I see the hill byt it's so far away
I know I can't reach it
but I try again and again in my dark dreams
when the mightiest of all will now
Run for the Night burn away
the times of his fall I've to pay
Visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and bloodlust their weapons and madness
you see to their
eyes there's no way out
I'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
to the end I'll fight but I know that the things
that I do are so meanless  Oh no
reach it
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can I stay here
when the mightiest of all will now
Run
You see them running in the shadows of the night
it is not what it used to be
you see them running with the wind they
run for the night 
I watched them murder and kill
Lot against the destroyed will
I watched a man ripped to shreds
Stench of rot does not offend
Create a theme sell it how
Promiscuous no consequence
Think of ways to shock us now
Good luck I've seen it all
I will pay for this death and destruction
Just to know such things exist
I will pay for this death and destruction
Knowledge of evil paralysis
Overkill exposure
Cannibalistic destruction
Fanatical debauchery
Glorified infidelity
Show me death show me lies
Show me unthinkable darkness
Programmed perversion of the worst kind
Show me death show me lies
Show me unthinkable darkness
Show me death show me lies
I will pay for this death and destruction
Just to know such things exist
I will pay for this death and destruction
Knowledge of evil paralysis
Overkill exposure
Guard my heart guard my will
Think of ways to shock us now
Guard my heart guard my will
Keep your death and lies
Guard my heart guard my will
Think of ways to shock us now
Guard my heart guard my will
Keep your death and lies
Expectations of actions  that conform
Foreign beliefs  put in position to be killed
You have to go  you have to fight
There's no one else that's capable
No one else would even dare
Put your life on the line without a word
Silent and stealth
Just like you were trained to kill
Your hands are tied
You've been compromised
As the bullets rain down on your hide
Twenty yards and counting
The enemy rears his head
Black eyes glaring hate
In his heart
Blood and sweat mixed with earth
Bloody mess stench of death
Blood and sweat mixed with earth
Searing flesh is what you're worth
Your hands are tied
You've been compromised
As the bullets rain down on your hide
Your hands are tied
You've been compromised
As the bullets rain down on your hide
Engage
Sent to defend
Your hands are tied
You've been compromised
As the bullets rain down on your hide
Your hands are tied
You're gonna die
By decisions made in someone else's mind
Moral laws do not apply
The mind is capable to justify
The madman has come
The madness attacks my mind
Cannot comprehend a purpose in randomness
Where is God Have you killed him
Self aware observation
Thousands of years
Finite greatness finite cruelty
The madman has come
The madness attacks my mind
Cannot comprehend a purpose in randomness
Where is God Have you killed him
Liberation of no law
Exhilaration of no God
Justified in the mind
Leads to horrors of every kind
The madman has come
The madness attacks my mind
Cannot comprehend a purpose in randomness
Where is God Have you killed him
Product of some enlightenment
Cheapening a life once lived
The feeble and degenerate
Deemed unworthy living burdens
Social engineering
Genetic playground of the elite
Rationalize these thoughts and processes
Sterilize  Conclude who can live and die
Selective breeding  Racial hygiene
The extreme survival of social Darwin
Social engineering
Genetic playground of the elite
Who decides who lives and dies
What is the cost of life
The intellect of a MiniGod
Selective breeding  Racial hygiene
No compassion in this process
Only pseudoscientific notions
Who decides who lives and dies
What is the cost of life
Who decides who lives and dies
Broken down one by one
They'll take your pride and crush it
The fall that comes is real by pure degradation
Amputate  Humiliate
Who can take this punishment
Broken mind  Face down in the sand
Spirit Spirit  Rise Rise
Destruction comes only once in a lifetime
Cannot be great in your mind
This is the time to say your last prayer
If you desire peace then prepare for war
Destroy the body and mind  I am ready for mine
Broken mind  Face down in the sand
Spirit Spirit  Rise Rise
Broken mind  Face down in the sand
Spirit Spirit  Rise Rise
Prepare for war  Rise
Prepare for war  And rise
Subvert the conscious mind of us all
Become the one who is the fraud
Deny the evil that pervades
Deny the sin that fuels the way
Pull down the blinders rip down the shades
See the world as it has been made
The laws of life point the way
The ordering of every thing
Deny the conscience of righteousness
Paint broad strokes of piousness
Everyone believes in something everyone believes
Random  organized lie
Random  organized lie
Pull down the blinders rip down the shades
See the world as it has been made
The laws of life point the way
The ordering of every thing
Random  organized lie
Random  organized lie
Infamy  you lost your way again
This was the day the day that you resigned
Infamy  this was not His design
I was yours you were mine cannot describe
I was yours you were mine this pain inside
Now I've turned to look  only a shadow remains
My land has been laid to waste
A drop of hope is all I taste
This is a reckoning of love
The calculation of my heart
This is a reckoning of love
The calculation of my death
No hope for return
You have brought infamy
No hope for return
Speaking grace solemnly
Depression  sets in
The serpent  stakes its claim
Losing faith  what it means to be alive
The shadows all around me dance for sorrow
I was yours you were mine cannot describe
I was yours you were mine this pain inside
Now I've turned to look  only a shadow remains
My land has been laid to waste
A drop of hope is all I taste
This is a reckoning of love
The calculation of my heart
This is a reckoning of love
The calculation of my death
No hope for return
You have brought infamy
No hope for return
Speaking grace solemnly
This is a reckoning reckoning
This is a reckoning reckoning
This is a reckoning reckoning
This is a reckoning
Through the raging gates of hell
He has shown redemption
He has opened up the skies
And made up for my losses
Who can make dark the purpose of Yahweh
Who can take away the hand of compassion
The air is blessed and my house is full
I was destroyed but Your hand brought beauty
I am lifted by her love
Through the cracks of my despair
Each day is made new in Your hands forever
This is a call to the weak
These are the words we proclaim
Piece by piece I have gained a part of myself
My dreams are one again
Let me take you
Beauty  Your majesty
Love forgives travesty
This is a call to the weak
These are the words we proclaim
Piece by piece I have gained a part of myself
My dreams are one again
Let me take you
Beauty  Your majesty
Love forgives travesty
Love forgives
Love forgives
Love forgives
At first site dreams fulfilled
You were love and love was the answer
A covenant bound by words
A covenant bound by blood
Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your tongue is the spear
Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your secret is no more
A door was opened  the other was unshut
My heart withering every secret
I have looked into the room
I have seen Judas
A serpent's day and they feasted
Your dream was eaten
Your heart has become a grave for robbers
Love turned to hate  justified by fate
Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your tongue is the spear
Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your secret is no more
A serpent's day and they feasted
Your dream was eaten
I looked in the room  she was gone
The world has changed
My heart has remained
A serpent's day and they feasted
Your dream was eaten
Your heart has become a grave for robbers
Love turned to hate  justified by fate
Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your tongue is the spear
Your plague has ruined me
Made a mockery
Your secret is no more
Abandoned  Left for dead
Kept outside ostracized
Unwanted in your eyes
Cut me off thrown aside
Is this why I was born
Is this what I come from
This world has been lost long ago
God is my home
Estranged bastard I am
Never had the reasons why
God has taken me in
Healed my wounds loved me in my sin
Is this why I was born
Is this what I come from
This world has been lost long ago
God is my home
God has taken the one you never wanted
My home  God is my home
You have a new way
Is it a better way
Once I saw you proclaim
Now there's slight disdain
Love is present grace abounds
What happened here Was the world so enticing
Denial is treachery hard to reconcile
Call it for what it really is
Don't make excuses
Call it for what it really is
Go ahead apostasy
Tepid waters do not run
Stagnation breeds disease
Flies surround
Multiply maggot parasites
Why keep that title Why redefine
Lord of the flies
Apostasy Apostasy
Love is present grace abounds
What happened here Was the world so enticing
Denial is treachery hard to reconcile
Call it for what it really is
Don't make excuses
Call it for what it really is
Go ahead apostasy
Do not conform to one man
God is clear on who you are
Love grace and mercy are there
Do not pretend apostasy
Wisdom  keeps you safe
Discretion  opposes sin innate
His Truth  guides and reveals
The One Sacrificed  striped to heal
Protection  only comes from God
Entrusted  to provide His love
Responsible  for this heart
Impartation  a Grace on fire
You have a part  of my heart
You have a part  of my heart
You have my heart always forever
You have my heart always forever forever
I would die to protect you but I cannot
Panic coast to coast
We bring a wave of madness
We bring a wave of row
Let your head explode
Hey out there  you better be aware
Here comes psychoscare
Are you ready for the shock
Let's get freaky  freaky freaky freaky
Let's get freaky  we go insane
Let's get freaky  freaky freaky freaky
Let's get freaky  give up your brain
Forget about the rules 
The risk is our fuel
We bring a wave of madness
Let chaos be our tool
Burning down the school
What happened to my girl
Out in the dark  you will be lost and apart
But if you run away with a desperate heart
You will stand alone again
Out in the rain
Will you never  ever  come back again
Knock on my door  find my way to your home again

That stupid system  it makes you insane
Go on a journey with no end
I got a sign from the god of rock'n'roll
I hear his voice when I'm caught down in a hole
My blood is screaming
it's drumming through my veins
Only my amp could break all the fuckin' chains
Shut down your church  now it's judgement day
Shut down your church  let the guitar pray
My religion Is rock and roll
My religion will save my soul
My religion is rock and roll
My religion will save my soul
I feel the kiss from the queen of rock'n'roll
Run to the moon and back out of control
My blood is boiling it's blasting in my veins
Inside my head I feel diving aeroplanes
Shut down your church  now it's judgement day
Shut down your church  let the guitar pray
I wanna burn  in any case
I live a dream of a rocking race
I'll never stop  how fast the game will go
I have to burn  bright like a star
I'll always drive the passing car
I'll never sleep  how long the race will go
Hey now what we gonna do
Hey now taste something new
I'll never rest  how far a game will go
Only the good die young
Living as a rebel  dying as a rebel
Only the good die young you know
I've got a kiss  of speed'n'roll
I'll gain the race for my soul
I'll never stop  how fast the game will go
Hey wake up I break up
When you throw sticky eyes to me
Hey fat neck Please get back
To your hole I don't wanna see
All these love bombs you drop into my face
All your love guns I'll touch you in no case
Oh you say that I'm too shy
Oh your bad breath makes me cry
You're like a zombie zombie
Like a zombie to me
You're like a zombie zombie
Like a zombie to me
I wanna cry out  hey spy out
Why can't you see
You're like a zombie zombie
Like a zombie to me
Hey wake up Please break up
Yes you damn make me spit white foam
Hey fat neck Please get back
To your nice old people's home
Though I'd sit a hundred years in jail
I will never fuck with an ancient whale
Oh trust me I'm not shy
Oh but your bad breath lets me cry
You can't choose  what you want
Like a beast  in a cage  you freak out
In sheer rage  life's like in a zoo
Tell me why can't you see  this is your destiny
Welcome welcome  welcome to the jungle
Hide your head  leave no trace
Or you will  be a blaze  in this masquerade
Dog eat dog  there's no mercy
she ripped me off  I had to pay the price
Versace was her prayer and Prada was her creed
Achtung  I'm on a road to ruin
Achtung  she's got me by the balls
Achtung  I don't know what I'm doing
She's driving me insane
Oh my god I get a heart attack
oh my god I get a heart attack
Gimmeda gimmeda gimmeda money back
Oh my god I get a heart attack
Of course she needed diamonds
of course she loved champagne
Her noble nose was stuck in pure cocaine
I wanna take you on a ride
Walk on a tightrope through the night
Not just a dream it's real oh yeah
We walk ahead high in the air  walk over there
A never dying flame
You should lie for me if you wanna be my girl
You should cry for me if you wanna be my girl
hey don't look down tonight
Would you lie for  would you cry for me
And tell me would you die for me
I'm gonna take you on a plane
We start a skyjack once again
But they won't catch us trust in me
A moment for eternity  yes you will see
Oh my girl what we're doing
Like surfin' on the light
Yes whatever you're doing
You won't forget this night
Don't forget this night
We live to ride  yeah we'll fight against time
All eyes on me  see me speeding like a gun
Fast as a bullet
The race has just begun
Watch out
I've got a heart of chrome
Watch outI'm ready to explode
'cause gasoline is running
through my veins
And I am totally insane
Ready steady thunder Ohohohoho
Ready steady thunder Ohohohoho
We are speeding hunters Ohohohoho
Ready steady thunder Ohoh
A cloud of dust  and a thousand smoking pipes
At twisting speed  of a thousand screaming bikes
It's almost like  riding an electric chair
Ready steady thunder
Hey you motherfucker
You rotten hiphop sucker
You call yourself a rapper
I call you wannabe
You talk 'bout pimps and bitches
You're having me in stitches
You talk about your rhyme skills
Ain't that ridiculous
I hate I hate
I hate hip hop hip hop
you know what I mean
I hate trash pop trash pop
so stupid and clean
hip hop trash pop
I give a fuck
I'm the Hip Hop Hater
I need rock rock
Hey bloody techno DJ
You're showing off the whole day
You think you're a musician
I call you wannabe
Your girl's boobs look fantastic
Everything is plastic
Your music is just playback
I've no wish for this never ending pain
Know all thee who walk this darkened road
Misery shan't enter our domain
Heaven descend with all thy might
Cruel be thou fate the way of light
Blinding the weakest souls in temptation
On the path of ultimate damnation
Feed theses eyes so blind
This encephalic shell
Hollow since thy dawn
Forever doomed to Hell
Forsake all those who see through the fog
May they be stranded in eternal doom
Erase from my mind all the mayhem
Denial is the seed from which happiness blooms
Heaven descend in all thy might
Cruel be thou fate the way of light
Blinding the weakest souls in temptation
On the path of ultimate damnation
Shield these thoughts from me
Drowned in thy mercy
Crucified denial
Will vanquish this trial
Heaven descend in all thy might
Cruel be thou fate the way of light
Blinding the weakest souls in temptation
On the path of ultimate damnation
Through the eyes of a Sinner like me
I see it all all your insanity
Through the eyes of a Sinner like me
I see it all all your profanity
To be one who crawls to me
For I'm the only sacrifice
To be the one who runs from me
As I deny the book of Christ
To be the one the one to see
No weakness in this heart of mine
To call my name to hear your plea
As you fight to earn Charon's dime
A warrior in my demise
To end all your hypocrisy
Your sacred Reich is bound to fail
Fall to the ground for all to see
There's no Heaven there's no Zion
But still you kill in the name of God
As I move on you're dead and gone
Thoughts lost in the land of Nod
Demonic glorious
Sanctified denial
Rottened bewildered
By Morpheus's veil
Upon thee comes the night
Awakened blood omen
As light turns to darkness
For this sin known as Man
Judgment come before me
Enlight our path of wrong
Whisper words of hatred
Of sanity long gone
Descend oh blessed night
We'll perish before long
Thunder clouds fill the sky
Sing us our final song
Tenebrae aeternum
Mortis vir ensiferum
Repent in the cries
Of thy own demise
Guilt sweetens the tears
That stench of thou fear
Repent in the cries
Of the worlds demise
Regret for thou lust
As ashes turn to dust
Purify
The known world
So this curse
Can be banned
Punishment
Redemption
Will heal this
Tainted land
Witness all the pleas
Of forgiveness undone
Yield to the power
Of this curse to come
Sound of the seventh trumpet
Hail the apocalypse
Dethrone these dictators
Merciless forsakers
Sound of the seventh trumpet
Ultimate curtain call
Dethrone these dictators merciless forsakers
Of our world
As all light fades
Gone without a trace
May the world wither
As shadows take place
May the world wither as shadows take place
Darkness descend
Upon this land
Scream all silenced
Rise all those damned
As we walk through the dusk
Towards this sacred night
Oh walking corpse
Drain these thoughts
This goblet of fire
Of ways so lost
Cradle in my arms
For a while
Burn the fake cross
Of thoughts defiled
May God forbid
All that I am
Kneel before this
Rise of the damned
Insurge against all those lies
Thoughts mechanical
Oh silent lamb
Take this life
Of echoes of blood
Of tainted strife
Honor thy will
Own thy fate
Truth shall prevail
Through the hate
Firesnakes ascending
Uncoiled to bring Hell
From above and below
We come with Darkness cruelly
Strangling the world
Tightening our grip with each rotation
We slither around the throat of existence
And squeeze out all life
Spitting venom in the face of the earth
Feel the rush of Death
Intoxicating all mankind
We are method to the madness
Narcotic terror
Triple Death and Dispersion
Illuminating the blessed and the damned
With triple tongues of fire
Incinerating reason
Nothing will ever be the same
Free of birth and dying
Elusive Evil moving unnoticed
An unholy hallucination
We were never here
Spitting venom in the face of the earth
Feel the rush of Death
Configurated by Chaos
Our God has no face
We have no core we just are
And we are forever
Blind and mad
Spreading Chaos and Death
Monarch marching
Reigning in the name of the Divine
Unbound and murderous
Morbid Messiah hungering for war
Unwilling to bow for anything
Kneel and offer defeat
Devoid of mercy
Lives are just lives and mean nothing to me
I am God and spit at you people
Fuelled with fury
Compelled by the raging hate inside
Conditioned to conquer and create
My Will is the Will of all
Peace I know not
Rage is my religion
Where cultures clash I take command
And feed the fire with black hatred
Crosseyed gaze on supremacy
Expansion of the Elite
Centered at one vision
Backdraft of antihuman sanity
There will be death at the end of the tunnel
From war to war I grow in number
Parading in power
Utopia is within reach
Chaos Christus Vincit
Chaos Christus Regnat
Chaos Christus Imperat
Contra mundum ad infinitum
Contra mundum ad absurdum
Contra mundum ad nauseam
Consummatum Est
Asphyxiating the spawn of the impure
The Final Solution to subhuman life
Exterminate all
My kingdom is One
From earth to heaven bodies pile
Megalomania knows no limits
Full blooded misanthropic
I am superior to all races
In Nomine Noxathanus
In Nomine Chaosathanas
In Nomine Zazazathanas
No god of order shall illuminate my soul
On and on
For nothingness I go
Smiting myself down deeper and deeper
Into unalterable Blackness
Turn to the Night of Choronzon
Downwards with a sigh
Through the corridor of Da'ath
My wings fly backwards to the beginning
On the rim of Dissolution
I spin out of my sight and out of my mind
I go beyond thought and beyond Being itself
Beyond knowledge beyond order
Beyond cosmos beyond god
Iaidal
Iaidal
Iaidal
Iaidal
Iaidal
I become zero empting of being
Unformed deformed and unformed again
My anterior shape is uncreated
For I'm forgotten in my memories
Reborn inside the bowels of Nox
As I crawl along the shores
Of the foaming seas of Oblivion
Sub Noctes Nocte
Sub Noctes Nocte
Sub Noctes Nocte
Here is where it all ends
Here lives nothing
Whatsoever has died
Goes on dying
Sic Luceat Nox
Sic Luceat Nox
Sic Luceat Nox
Chaos is the Great Father
And I have returned
I witness the Darkness Undying
Hidden from all eyes
Hail Choronzon hail
Come Choronzon come
I salute and conjure Thee
O Choronzon
By the chaos that moves me
By the madness that imprisons me
By the Power of Undying Darkness
I conjure Thee again
By the Word that opens ZAX
ZARZAX calls upon thee
By Three and by Three and by Three
Come unto me
Hail unto Thee
Who are Thrice One
Whose Name is the Second Death
Thou who outnumbers the legions of light
Thou whose voice is the insane babble
Of a multitude of demons
Thou who screams I am I
Come forth from the Nothingness
Thou are the Master of Form
And from Thee all forms proceed
Thou who hath no face
For Thou hath all faces
Thy ways are methods to the Madness
Share my insane hatred
Against the supposed creator
And slay the son of man
Zodacare Od Zodameram
Zodacare Od Zodameram
Zodacare Od Zodameram
Zodacare Od Zodameram
Unsanctify this place of peace
That all righteousness departs from it
Befoul this planet with the stench
Of thy excrements
O Choronzon
Thou who art seated higher than the heavens
I pray that Thou bestoweth unto me
The knowledge of the world between being and not
Feel free to manifest
Feed upon the names of god
For Thou art Master of the Triangle
Come unto me
Come to life
Corruptor of all coherence
Set ablaze this earth of matter
Rise Choronzon rise
Lexarph Comanon Tabitom
Come Choronzon
I welcome Thee
I am servitor to Thy Dominion
Zodacare Od Zodameranu
Razors slashing
Grabbing beneath skin
Blood all over
I undo myself from face
This body I refuse
Must be sacrificed to my rage
For it's an insult and a blasphemy
To the Satanic Will
Hail Satan
Hail Satan
I am Chaos
Made out of Madness
I carry Insane Hatred
And yes I know not god
The supposed blessing from creation
Has been withheld from me ever since I was born
And yes I know not god
And yes I know not god
My hatred requires more and more blood
Each time I rip myself to pieces
Bound to become bleeding
Bound to become drained from all holy
Molesting god's gift
I slit myself clean
This carcass was Satanized
And it's terminal
Salvation through self mutilation
I cut myself red
Purification through putrefaction
God rots inside me
Until all righteousness
Latent in the core of my being is exhausted
Scraping all human from my soul
Which is black as pitch
Cut off from god
Ceremonial separation
Removal of father son and holy spirit
Agla Eloim
Agla Jehova
Agla Sabaoth
Agla Adonai Mathon
Thou are fully and utterly aborted
Unclean spirit I cast you out
In wormholes they gather
Human maggots singing praise
On their knees beneath the ground
Hunchbacked for the feast
Coffin flies amassed
Congregated in gluttony
Hungering for sores and other holes
To multiply mongoloid larvae
Digging their way
Through cracks in the soil
Tunnelling down to their dinner
Jesus is waiting
The flies are starved
Unearting their holy host
To feed over his carcass
Jesus is served
Snorting up the stench of salvation
As love exudes from their rotting messiah
A swarming stampede high on decay
Exultant as they excavate
Maggots come maggots come
Crawl up the cunt of Christ
Cave him out from inside
Infantile sect of insects
Inhabit the corpse
Clean up the skeleton
Eat the rot to the bone
Jesus Loves You
And receives with open wounds
I lie hidden
Enshrined in Darkness
Stiff and silent
Waiting to awake my Self
I appear dead before my own eyes
Staring coldly at my vacant face
Gaze fixation on my own corpse
Which is now a grave to rot in
Deadly unbalanced to Outer Negative
Infinite Blackness of body and soul
I realize
There is no life inside this body
Broken from the world
And broken from my Self
I lock all access to my conscience
And welcome catatonia
Out of this dying death cell
With walls of flesh
Bars of bone
And me in between
Bound and loathing
Razored and restless
In my wrappings of tissue
Slash this prison of skin
From embodied to disembodied
Exposing my soul
To the full onslaught of Chaos
I shall be liberated
I am becoming Noxul
A terror to my own psyche
A terror antagonizing my body
I shall be completely Chaotic
Branded to reach Omnipotence
The secret knowledge
And the forbidden wisdom
Will be mine
Fangs thrust my soul
As I call upon the Risen Serpent
Drugged with infernal injections
I receive the acid from Amenta
Intoxicated with Death
Struck by the Triple Tongue of Fire
Fragments of my Self exploded together
I am born
I come
From the living centre of Hell
I will fix and I will finish
I solve everything
I am the helping hand of Armageddon
Inspirator behind the cleansing
Genocide  Satan Lives
Genocide  Satan Lives
I dictate what needs to be done
To save this shithole from surviving
Listen to me
I am the Way
Disrupting the total equilibrium
All balance must be banished
Peace ripped to pieces
All is good when all is dead
I will bring the world to sleep
And leave it with raging Chaos
The end and perfection
Of the Great Work
I will not disappear
I will only get worse
Inexorable Evil
Everything bows before Satan Ex Machina
I will swallow the soul of the Earth
I will swallow the soul of the Earth
I will swallow the soul of the Earth
I will swallow the soul of the Earth
Darkness  Blackness  Death
As I help creation to get rid of itself
Rewinding the life cycle until nothing is left
Let's celebrate the end of existence
Always aversive
Doing evil in the sight of the lord
Judas among twelve
I'm the corruption of all commandments
I am the scourge of all that cures
The hands of Christ never heal
I travel on the scythe of the Reaper
And suffocate the skies with rot
There is no Hell which I am not
Unravelled incursion upon god
Forever persistence in what is absurd
Disfigured by wilful perversion
I blast through the soft flesh of cosmos
And beat the heavens down from the skies
I am ever more monstrous
Playing dice with the universe
I am the Void that shadows suns
I am the Black that swallows stars
I am the pulse of Black Chaos
I am nocturnal storm
And the nuclear blackness within
Eight rayed Terror unfurled
Chaotic Will over Order
Drawing all forces inward
I am the magical engine of occult power
I rejoice on blood and ritual death
I regenerate by fires fed with human bones
I am the Names upon which is called
Before the sacrifice is made
I am the spell in motion
The ritual words as spoken
I am a thousand curses
For a thousand blessed saints
Intellectual subversion
I am the door in the soul which opens on Hell
Chaosmorphosis of the holy spirit
Let there be Madness
Many limbs and many teeth
Arachnid Archon lurking at the Crossing
To swallow all consciousness without a trace
Weaving funnels from Zero to Nothing
None shall pass
Weaving funnels from Zero to Nothing
None shall tell
Weaving funnels from Zero to Nothing
None shall return
I reign from infinity to infinity
And I reign out of control
Uncreated Father of all things
As a man crawls away from his grave
Strangers welcome into our HighTech Age
Into my selfpreserving days
I have fought for many reasons
I have lost myself into this reason
Condemned perhaps for the last time
Countdown my second last ride
Transformed he doesn't feel at all
Allowing the dead to rise again
To rise again
Upgrading man with steel
Countdown my second last ride
He doesn't feel at all
My sweet unhuman beings
My sweet unhuman beings
It's here for me
100 years and you shall see
And this is my personal turning point
My wireless way of saying I love myself to death
My sweet unhuman beings
Reborn
Upgrading man with steel
Countdown my second last ride
He doesn't feel at all
My sweet unhuman beings
Cross your heart and hope to die
These are the words and your lies
Goddamn this night and your brand new world
Where is the flame that burns still bright
I spent one hour dying hard
I pushed and shoved until I cried
Not because of you or the world I've seen
A little crack in the sky so bright
reveals the truth of useless time
I'm just so lost without you all
My wasted years of denial
Wake up the angels inside you
invite the demon that loves us all
Goddamn this mind that is full of hate
ride my everlasting war
Tell me what to do
I have trained myself for you
Through the flames of hell
suffered inside my shell
Shot cold so many times
I have lived among your lies
Through the flames of hell
suffered inside my shell
Wake up the dead besides you
invite the fire that greets us warm
Goddamn these needles that take me away
ride my everlasting war
A little crack in the sky so bright
reveals the truth of useless time
I'm just so lost without you all
A violent aftertaste
these cuts and scars from yesterday
Greetings from one who's raging
ripping it's way out of it's cage
No use to struggle with yourself cut your halo
Are just my cuts and scars from yesterday
You fought so hard against it all
Now your little heart feeds your loser god
No use to struggle with yourselves
Let my knife guide you
A violent aftertaste
these cuts and scars from yesterday 
1000 tales to tell nightmares and dreams
No use to struggle with yourself cut your halo
Some battles fought some wins to come
In this world of pain
Wandering through the nations
I get this weird hallucination
That I'm alright
Detaching from the patience
This is my lack of concentration
The Cycle of Zero
There is
No other place to go
This is
The Cycle of Zero
My way
No other place to go  and I feel fine
Searching all the places
I place myself before them all
And that's so sweet
Retarded from the patience
This is my triumph of concentrations
I'm a trophy of gods
Then one day I stare I stare at the sun
And there is noone to see that I'm gone
One day I gaze I gaze at the moon
And there is no one to judge what I've done
I found this before you
I found this before you
Detaching from the patience
This is my lack of concentration
And I feel fine
Wandering through the nations
I place myself above them all
I'm on my way
Then one day I stare I stare at the sun
And there is noone to see that I'm gone
One day I gaze I gaze at the moon
And there is no one to judge what I've done
I found this before you
I found this before you
And now they want to be his friends again
It's not that easy This is a time for reckoning
Now they want to be on his side again
He has come to claim what belongs to you
You don't want to waste your breath on him
Tim rules the throne a time for reckoning
And now they want to be on his side again
It's time for Tim to claim the first prize
Now his the master of the skies
Absolute power gone wrong
You don't want to waste your breath on him
Tim rules the throne a time for reckoning
Now they want to be on his side again
He has come to claim what belongs to you
You don't want to waste your breath on him
Tim rules the throne a time for reckoning
Seven Sixtytwo
Escaping reality as we shatter down in pieces
As those who are under its spell
Like 762
I'm loading myself with 762
Like 762
I'm loading myself with 762
I tried to say he's in misery
Just the one oh my lonely one
Another mirror another reflection
He died today and I tried to say
Just a word he was the last one of us
Another time another reaction
Help us to find a way to tear down this cradle
A man darkened by the God himself
Sunshine warming all but one please let him go
There was a time he walked the line
easy path shortcut don't be last
Another route another direction
I tried to say he would die today
Help us to find a way to tear down this cradle
A man darkened by the God himself
Sunshine warming all but one please let him go
Help us to find a way to tear down this cradle
A man darkened by the God himself
My mind says no but the flesh is too weak
Where should we start
How about from the end
Why not leave
No after all I just want you to feel the same
A rainy Sunday night a little man still fights
Hey please He's on his knees
While he bleeds
This cannot be We had a deal
But can't you see While he bleeds
What is the matter with you
What the hell you think you do
Everyone can see you trough
You act like a holy savior
Somehow some damn superior
Oh What a strange behavior
How does it feel to be so damn selfsatisfied
What does it take to get your feet on the ground
You're so lame with your fame
No one can ever take you for real
The smell of green will always turn your nose
You're yesterday's news
On the way to stardom fortune and fame
Breaking promise is this the name of the game
Like a spineless crave fool
No one's gonna trust in you
You're so lame with your fame
No one can ever take you for real
The smell of green will always turn your nose
You're so lame with your fame
No one can ever take you for real
The smell of green will always turn your nose
You're yesterday's news
Now take the stage
Take your positions
Then swallow your fears
You can't turn back now
Spreading your soul
Selling yourself
In each an every town
The crowd meets their clowns
Excited ecstatic
You're facing your true self on this stage
'Cos we all hide our clown's face down within
And we all are more than what we say
And they stare right into the eyes of the clown
The play goes on and on and truth may be found
Ascending high above the crowd
Yet tears are falling down
From the eyes of the clown
Lights flashing bright
And the show is on
Like no end in sight
The beast takes his bite
Surrender to him
And let yourself go
But be prepared to die
Still one more time
Without a hint out of the blue
My entire world fell apart
In their lust for power
My foes they went too far
They sent a man into my home
An assassin second to none
I only caught a glint of chrome
And saw his work was done
Tormented you will be
Revenge I will feed
No matter how you plead
Tonight you shall bleed
He got away and left the town
But he left me a trail
Enough for me to hunt him down
And I will make him pay
Tormented you will be
Revenge I will feed
No matter how you plead
Tonight you shall bleed
The circle's complete now and I take your life
Like a clean shiny on
On your uncharted skin
It's creamy cover the raspberry spill
This steely lover is ready to kill
Tormented you will be
Revenge I will feed
No matter how you plead
Tonight you shall bleed
Take a look at the powers that be
Still believing they're making history
Cruising on that diesel course
Forcing life into a longdead horse
Every time one well is emptied
Another foreign strike is preempted
We're living on old fossil lives
And lead by men cheating for their prize
Wars shame and selfabuse
Failed states are on the news
All nations have to choose
Survival or the noose
We got the world to lose
Old men draining the land
Their souls turning to holes
Penniless men were given their pens
And the hangedman rules
With his splitbrain views
Blinded like mice we try to throw the dice
With our hands tied up
The money train don't stop
Step aside let us rise
Without fear into the storm
You've been out of place in time
Since the day when you were born
You are forced into the wheel
The soundless wheel you cannot see
Let me be the one to
Guide you far from that life
Too long you have been living in sin
Wasting what you have and what you could
Now the storm's coming well
Let's go face the rain
Just let them know
I'm going to be here
I got answers and nothing to fear
I can take what the heavens create
I got my own believes I don't need yours
I'm going to stay the course
Let's sway and pray
In the name of the storm
It's all the same part of the game
Where you and I are pawns
Suddenly the clouds appear
The colors shades are green
What's a lightning like this time
When everything's surreal
Just let them know
I'm going to be here
I got answers and nothing to fear
I can take what the heavens create
I got my own believes I don't need yours
Just let them know
I'm going to be here
I got answers and nothing to fear
I can take what the heavens create
I got my own believes I don't need yours
I'm going to stay the course
Like the blind who envy those who see
Little children rebel against the creed
They believe there is nothing left to tell
But the truth is stronger than their shells
What the poets said is left unsaid
And lady beauty weeps on her deathbed
She was pierced by your trends and deception
Hugs Suffocated by your sterile preconception
It's hard to find even to forget
This great new veil lies overhead
It hovers like a sickening plague like a plague
A Great Shadow
Deafening sickening
Waiting for the reckoning
Beckoning bickering
Searching for the Light
A Great Shadow
Deafening sickening
Waiting for the reckoning
In their minds searching for the Light 
Pleas a true emotion meat deaf ears
Only crocodiles are shedding tears
And the masses reaching for their grave
Are too numb to even feel the shame
Whenever prophets raise their voices
Middle legions say they're being exploited
They prefer fake liberty without goals
In a constant puberty under control
It's hard to find even to forget
This great new veil lies overhead
It hovers like a sickening plague like a plague
A Great Shadow
Deafening sickening
Waiting for the reckoning
Beckoning bickering
Searching for the Light
A Great Shadow
Deafening sickening
Waiting for the reckoning
In their minds searching for the Light 
You passed trough this life
Born into mankind
Mortal sins awaited you
I walked in the light
Never wanting to stray
Still your shade took over me
Now moving on
Departing so soon so soon so soon
Oh I'd like to stay with you
But there are no angels no more
No angels no more
Darkness was the seed
And truly part of me
All sweet things must have an end
Yet again this pain is real
I know it will disappear
The shade is covering me soon
We won't see again
In certainty there's peace
And what we had here will remain
So beautiful and pure
Departing so soon so soon so soon
Oh I'd like to stay with you
But there are no angels no more
The heavens are gone and so is our hell
Departing so soon so soon so soon
Oh I'd like to stay with you
But there are no angels no more
The heavens are gone and so is our hell
Our world is slowly dying in agony and pain
At first we were so innocent
And then became so vain
Doubledealing lawyers
Ruthless people everywhere
'Cause we didn't ever learn
To give away and share
Faceless men in towers made of ivory and steel
Selling guns and praying for peace
They can make you suffer
Make your life so unreal
There's no cure there's only disease
We will lost it all
Fortune and for fame
Time has come
Big wheels keep on turning
Time has come
Half the World is burning
Time has come
There is no escape no way out
Time has come
Ministers are preaching
They all know the end is near
The Armageddon's closer
Soon the reckoning is here
Money is still talking
Spreading violence and lies
All mankind in it's misery
Will pay the final price
Faceless men in towers made of ivory and steel
Selling guns and praying for peace
They can make you suffer
Make your life so unreal
There's no cure there's only disease
We will lost it all
Fortune and for fame
Time has come
Big wheels keep on turning
Time has come
Half the World is burning
Time has come
There is no escape no way out
Time has come
Ruthless pain is killing me
I cannot see the sun
We fought the mighty adversary
Still we haven't won
Waiting for my destiny
Grim reaper calls on me
Brace myself for eternity
Yet red and gold I see
I can hear the massive wings
And soothing tears I feel
Life begins to fill my veins
My wounds they start to heal
A faint scent of cinnamon
Reaches me trough air
I can see my savior
Flame up as a flare
Spread your wings
And shed your healing tears
Let the fire purify
In full blaze
You will meet the end
And then you shall transcend
A tantric resurrection
The city of the sun
A beautiful reflection
Of life spent on the run
In the atom's heart
Splitting souls inside
Vivid colors burn my eyes
On this wild bird I ride
Slowly gaining power
Patience is the key
What you need is a flame
That can burn you again
And the feeling of ecstasy
Wings like a bolt of lightning
Soaring to the sky
Only then in the end
When you can see again
All the earth is beneath you and bright
Cheated and down there was not a sound
When my father was silenced in shame
Old and frail just a forgotten tale
So they thought but I'll prove them wrong
Learning from the best
Training hard I passed their test
Heading home I don't have time for rest
I am searching all around
Like a hunter like a hound
And I focus on this task
They will meet their fate at last
I am searching everywhere
When I see them hiding scared
They will face my deadly stare
I choose to fight
For my pride and birthright
There are no other choices for me
Once I am done
My life purpose is gone
My story has and uneventful end
Here I stand and their blood stains my hand
Yet somehow I feel so relieved
I understand I must soon kill again
There's meaning in just being mean
Learning from the best
Training hard I passed their test
Heading home I don't have time for rest
I am searching all around
Like a hunter like a hound
And I focus on this task
You will meet your fate at last
I am searching everywhere
When I see you hiding scared
You will face my deadly stare
I choose to fight
For my pride and birthright
There are no other choices to me
I can no stop
Oh I love to fight too much
My victims are my purpose of life
And when at the end of my life
I see what I've done
I cannot help but feel
That once again all the pain
For our children will run trough
In the evil that men do
The mighty dragon in her lair
There is no daylight and no air
There's pleasure a treasure
There lies an endless nightmare
Go inside if you dare
Many heroes tried and failed
The lonely dragon in her lair
Shes got gold but she doesn't care
Shes waiting for someone
To hold and not to run
She wants love she wants passion
Many years she tried and failed
Now the years are passing by
Lady Dragon doesn't fly
She lies in her keep
Tryin' to sleep
Longing for neverending love
The mighty dragon in her lair
She met a king with golden hair
He wanted the treasure
She wanted love and pleasure
He tried to cut her wing
Just one breath did kill the king
Still the years are passing by
Lady Dragon doesn't fly
Almost lost her wing
By the evil king
Longing for neverending love
A masquerade of our wounded souls 
I don't want to know where you are 
You filled my heart with your molten stone 
And my soul has ceased to believe 
Now I know that never is never 
Now I see that nothing's forever 
Now I know that never is never 
Don't want to be a victim between love and hate 
No one knows how our time passed by 
Our sweetest years are turning to grey 
I dream of youth still I don't know why 
My passion fails to find my heart 
Now I know that never is never 
Now I see that nothing's forever 
Now I know that never is never 
Don't want to be a victim between love and hate 
No more hatred no more sorrow 
No more heaven no tomorrow 
No more crying no pretending 
No more lies no happy ending 
Stirred up with envy and revenge deceived
The mother of mankind
We spiral through the labyrinthine madness
Truth subsides in the nepenthe of false shamans
Anesthetized and subdued
Destined to an opaque reality
The righteous path obscured
We wage our atonement for a beguiling divinity
We spiral through the labyrinthine madness
Truth subsides in the nepenthe of false shamans
He rests on the ashes of a dying world
Azrael shadows the gaze of the fading sun
Screams of oblivion shadow the sun
The breed of Tartarus
Slayer of Balaam descends
Cast down to the snake wreathed margins of Sheol
Animating in subterfuge
Like the hound that bestrides the Witch of Endor
You roam the bottomless pit of Hades
You exult at the moans of a 1000 whores
Trading their souls for torment and gore
Forsaking virtue for decadence
Their sunken eyes wide with greed
They worship your deceit crawling at your feet
Vengeance is your father
Slander your bride
We delight at the misfortune of one another
Our sins your pride
Your hands carved the annihilation of Hiroshima
The sheep who cradle final solutions your flock
For 40 days you mocked the Redeemer
Yet your enthronement shall never be fulfilled
He shall stand forever supreme and tall
Vengeance is your father
Slander your bride
We delight at the misfortune of each other
Our sins your pride
Soaring from the carrion realm
Sundering the seal of Almadel
Betroth to the antinomy of divine might
Lucifuge Refocale he who flees from the light
Ars goetia hierarchy of damnation
Forging evanescent empires through lust
Ascended from the circle of conjuration
Devouring honour defiling trust
Vanguards of the void faceless wooden pawns
Anthropogenesis novo ordo nihil
Bound to a cadaverous conscience
Eidolons cast to the otherworld
Chastising the wisdom of the ageless sage
Star fires doused by the mesmerising haze
Deserted in oceans of absence
Where sirens laud wondrous ephemeral souls
We remain moored at the edge
Of the broken sands of time
Transcending the insidious calm
We steer toward the unwalled kingdom of Damear
As our final hour approaches
The hopelessness still draws ever so near
Enthralled by the haunting sighs of Armida
Star of the crescent sands
Frail and bare our sanity abates
The essence of meaning escapes us
Our dreams sear and die
In the embrace of the hollow sun
Our solicitude prejudiced
Our hunger abounds
The days of pain still linger
The suffering does not subside
Piety and ebullience eclipsed
The bleakness abounds
Dystopia ruptures our hypnotic slumber
Enchanted by the charms of the unknowable
Unscathed by the scourges of the ages
Scrying through the navel of the earth
He beacons the passage to the ivory throne
He is the sage discarded and ridiculed by man
His words resound to our inescapable end
We have scorned his warnings and pitied his ways
The Valley of Megiddo will soon be his abode
The aftermath's quietude caresses his being
Demiurge Demigod of deception
Monarch of the apostate pantheon
Genealogy of betrayal
Procreator of damnation
Guardian of the nefarious legion
Transgressor usurper
Begetting the seed of Cain
Harvesting the souls of the pure
Consorting and blinding the fallen will
Preying on the frailty of the vain
The misguided worship your sins
Parading idols and embracing dogmas of treason
Yet He has come for His forsaken kin
Man reborn from the womb of blood thirsty hands
The misguided worship your sins
Parading idols and embracing dogmas of treason
Yet He has come for His forsaken kin
Reborn each dawn
Across the morning river dews
And myriad everspring hues of Mibor
Riding the eye of the storm
The bringer of light stealing the night
Adversary to the avenging captor
Armored by the crowning faith
Into the womb of the damned the iniquitous land
Sworn to shield the blood of the Saviour
A gladius of virtue clasped with pride
Lucifer dethroned Satan writhes and cries
Ending the scourge of the serpent tempter
Rise Metatron Rise
Receiver of souls
Your tears weighed by the transgressions of man
Awake blessed angel
Child of the fire mist
Reaching for the Sun
The seasons of renewal set sail
Over impervious cruel winter seas
Staggering straight to your car 
Don't waste no thought on your recklessness 
Knowing your home is not far 
Starting the engine shift to first gear 
Invulnerable you are 
Gaining speed with every second 
You are the highway star 
Run  faster 
Taking the corner devilstyle 
Finally risking it all 
Tires are losing the grip on wet leaf 
Clenching the wheel as you skid 
The engine's roaring one last time 
You're watching the tree coming near 
Never been afraid of dying 
Pain is your only fear 
As the blood runs 
Out of your countless wounds 
You realize you'll die 
Live fast 
Die young 
You just got 2 minutes to live 
Cut off leg broken arms 
Trapped in your wrecked pile of steel 
Percieving that you are unable to move 
Pinned behind the wheel 
Still conscious massive pain 
Watching your live passing by 
Even if help comes it will be too late 
Make yourself ready to die
Dwelling on memories 
Drowning in sorrow bothering you 
From inside they're crawling 
The Anger you can't hide 
Palefaced mindclones 
Imprisoned dignity 
Infected sanity 
Rotten egos 
Rotten to the core 
Cold isolation 
The last resort that keeps you breathing 
Just guided by instincts 
Aware of cunning penetration 
No one's servant 
Solid dignity 
Healed insanity
Welcome to a beautiful nightmare 
You can't escape 'cause it's reality 
Marching through a wasted land 
Dead bodies pave the way you walk 
Seeking the unknown 
Once again you kill the nameless one 
Waiting for the next command 
Just another bloody massacre 
I once was your victim 
You splattered my brain 
With violent oppression 
I now will return 
Back from the grave 
Live undead 
Evil reborn 
Live undead 
Meet me in a moonless night 
I suck your blood and eat your entrails 
Feasting on your lifeless corpse 
I gnaw the meat off the god damn bones 
Though it may seem a little late 
I enjoy the bitter sweet taste 
Of dissipated revenge
Another usual day in your life 
There you sit and wait to finish work 
Imaginations of subhuman kind 
As you knock on the door 
Your blood starts to boil 
Enjoy the pain you want more 
And you will never recoil 
Bow down now 
Obey 
Show obsequiousness 
Remote controlled you stalk through the streets 
As you know your aim and your aim is the pain 
Bondage gear and the lady in black 
As you knock on the door 
Your blood starts to boil 
Enjoy the pain you want more 
And you will never recoil 
Bow down now 
Obey 
Show obsequiousness
Don't move 
Lucky You won You survived
Suddenly I found myself 
Running out of lies running out of excuses 
Here I stand no apologies 
What else can I give 
To cover the betrayal 
That's the living in me 
Suddenly the truth is staring 
At my face your face his face 
Can't go on with this shit 
Running out of time 
Got no time to lose 
Here I'm standing got no ideas 
The truth they say will never come 
Here I'm standing got no stories 
The fairy tale has just begun 
I leave you now with another lie 
As I always pretend I am here 
Right back to where it all began 
Another circle ends 
Another broken heart
I found myself today 
Trapped in this bed 
My hands tied feet tied 
A hole in my head 
Nothing left inside my brain 
I don't even know my name 
I feel I see I smell 
This is my living hell 
What did I do why am I here 
No answers 
What would you do 
When all you knew is dead and gone 
You look around 
What you see makes no sense 
Feeling strange 
You realize you had a total blackout 
I am still lying on this plank bed here 
My inner self filled up with fear 
A spark of memories 
Becomes a flame 
A syringe needle in my vein 
Three tubes  liquid  that hose 
The end seems very close 
I woke up for my own execution 
I can't believe that 
I will soon be dead and gone 
The drugs work make me weak 
Make me dead 
Feeling tired 
I realize I'll have a total blackout
My life is changing so fast I can't explain 
A look at my past life than drying all my tears 
Passing the gate this is the hour of our fears 
Waiting my whole life why should I take care 
No one is waiting do I have to be there  
Leaders of our time just standing behind 
Fighting a war I can't ignore 
Future oppressions 
Forgotten displaced designed from a thought 
Now my last hope I'm praying to god 
What is behind this imaginary wall  
What is behind it  I don't know at all 
Future oppressions becoming more clear 
This is a warning so you must take heed 
Watching and waiting how deep I descend 
Is there deliverance in the end
Don't move 
You're dead
Thursday morning 6 am 
Waiting for the only train 
For my girl a kissgoodbye 
Tell her there`s no need to cry 
Get off the train into the plane 
Flying to the sun 
Hot like hell great hotel 
Longing for some fun 
Primal mission poolbarcheck 
Alcohol shall break the neck 
Both barmen look like suckers 
Just one word motherfuckers 
Madness surrounds 
hitting the town 
Just some tourist stores 
Back to the hotel 
a few more drinks 
Next days will bring more 
Poolbar drinks for free 
Sunna macht mi hie 
Morning fart shall blow 
Ritual in Rhodes 
Wake up with the morning shine 
Just to miss the breakfast time 
Sandwiches and coffee white 
All inclusive  that`s alright 
Down on the beach 
sun is unleashed 
Skin is turning red 
Back to the poolbar a lot of drinks 
Make us sleep like dead 
Poolbar free drinks kick 
Sun just makes me sick 
Morning fart still blows 
Ritual in Rhodes 
Rent some Harleys hit the road 
Cruising all along the coast 
Sun is burning from above 
All that`s left is one red scarf 
Centercourt calls just some old balls 
Afternoon sun on our skin 
Jump in the pool 
swim around the bar 
Having a few more drinks 
Poolbarkeepers suck 
Never playing rock 
Hate inside us grows 
Ritual in Rhodes 
Disco overdose 
Ritual in Rhodes 
Morning fart still blows 
Ritual in Rhodes
Get up at the usual time 
Packed bag in the corner of the room 
Breakfast  the day`s starting well 
Rushing in by the ringing of the bell 
Now my time has come 
And my job has to be done 
Don`t move it won`t help you anyway 
Get ready for my judgement day 
Highschool death 
Bullets flying through the classroom 
Ripping virginal flesh from the bone 
Blood spills from the teacher`s head 
He tortured me and now he`s dead 
Outside the parents cry 
Cops are waiting to come in 
Kids are screaming trying to run away 
This is my private judgement day 
Highschool deathLife will swallow
Every confronting form
And time will borrow
Curse you to repeat yourself
The path I follow
Is nothing but sadness and despair
When four walls I try to break
There's nothing there no one who tries
Stay and penetrate me inject me with pain
My eyes can see now desecrate me
When our moon is rising high
Where do we belong in this
Scratch these walls and now erase
Now unplug this pale embrace
When your thoughts will turn away
And the day will keep it's shade
A shade that i can still rename
Not suicide no giving pain
When the night that holds me dear
Offers comfort where there's no fear
Then i'll whisper to the moon
I'm done with hate i penetrate
If the hours would stand still
If those things would disappear
When you give yourself away
Chaos we will fall within
When you're fate becomes so dear
And there's the solitude I fear
No longer down I shall remain
I choke to death I suffocate
Without those memories of words
I stand to shut this open form
And grow more weary of this weight
Those dying words this cold embrace
Life will swallow every worm
With bottled curse or so you show
But i am able to despair
Bring this machine into the grave
And when you crack that open door
I slowly clearly see the smoke
In to this air I feel despair
When none is wake i give away
And when your thoughts will turn away
And there's day remains the same
Not suicide not giving pain
There's only death I give away
Nature dies as concrete reigns
The visions all seem to say
We're doomed to rot
They presume possession but it's an infection
We feel fear
Cured by fire
Let them fucking burn
Airborne infection
See how they run flee
They breathe in their own death
It never ends
Their soul won't move on they are
Confined within it's host
Confined even in death
Earth will rot it consumes their souls BLERK
We're
Genetic mutations
Humanimal
How will it end or will it never
The plague consumes meI am my own God
Master slave and I will be beyond the grave
No one will take my soul away
I carry my own will and make my day
I am my own God
See the truth beyond
Through endless lies thy kingdom come
Glorified wisdom illumination tool
Self deceit it's the golden rule
Live your life you're gonna die your own death
I dip my forefinger in the watery blood
Of your impotent redeemer
And write over his thorn torn brow
The true Prince of Evil
What man's created
Man can destroy
Bring to light
That day of joy
As the clouds so dark so mighty
Hid the light of the moon from my eyes
I felt their presence even stronger
My invocation had caused them to rise
Terrors beyond the human mind
Awaiting me for thousands of years
Dimensions of another kind
Between the gates
And the ancient domains
How was
I to know that halfway on my quest
They would have me drained
Theyve taken my body
In control but
I bare
No anguish no malice
The god of all gods are entitled
I remember the times
I used to travel beyond
All of what is and what has been
Is gone in mans mind
Theyve left me now
To shiver and cry like a child
Left me with the humiliation
Of knowing
Im not worthy of
Whats yet to come
By the dark and mighty waters
Im standing here alone
To hear and suffer my sentence
To pay the price
I owe
Im drowned
Terrors beyond the human mind
Awaiting me for thousands of years
Dimensions of another kind
Piercing their teeth
Into my skin and my flesh
Inner dimension beyond human conscience
I wish for only death
As your eyes filled are filled with horror
I lift up the corpse on the bench
You cant avoid the dismal sight
Its arms and legs I retrench
Excavating its interior
To get a hold of whats inside
And as I drivel and belch
You feel so damn reviled
As I continue with laughter
I drink the bowels rheum
Squeezing my hand through its mouth and further
Through its stomach to its womb
Of its once called body
There seems nothing to be left
And you better prepare yourself
For an equaling death
Revel in Flesh
Pools of coagulated blood
And rotten flesh by my side
Now I really need something more
To kill another day in my life
Stubborn old worthless hag
Simply had nothing to give
I couldn't stand your eternal nag
You didn't deserve to live
So I went to the stove and took a pork knife
and stabbed it into your head
Buried you in the fruit cellar
I was glad 'cause I thought you were dead
But the maggots didn't feast on your body
You didn't get moldy as I thought
And still I can hear that nag in my head
You were supposed to rot
Supposed to Rot
Now she haunts me day and night
A haunting I can't forget
The deed was a coldblooded homicide
a murder I regret
But still she's the same old hag
And still my life has turned the same
You were supposed to rot
A rotten stench
Surrounds another ended life
Maggots infesting the rotten flesh
Is that the way you want to die
Decomposed
Don't want to live in a decaying shell
But why should I go to heaven
And who's to say I'll enter hell
Dead  Deceased but life goes on
I will be the one who won
My charred body will decay
But my soul will be floating anyway
Visually a corpse
But what's inside my head
Don't consider I once was deceased
So I guess I'll come back from the dead
Dying my death
In relentless aggrieve
Dead and put down in a wooden box
Just can't be my destiny
Dead  Deceased but life goes on
I will be the one who won
Continue to seek and you will see
That life is your worst enemy
Blinded eyes
Blind towards reality
Subconcious lies
For whom did you really care
Can't let go
Slave to this mastery
Stop searching for
The things you were never near
Falling tears
Falling from your sorrow
For the one
Who ripped your heart to shreds
Who are they for
The dead one leaving peacefully
Better realize
Can't raise the one who's dead
Imaginary emotions
For someone that you cared for
Someone who isn't but was
It's just your own bitter loss
Blinded eyes
Won't hold no consolation
Subconcious lies
Won't set you free
Your falling tears
Are all mistaken
Dead and buried
Maybe that will make you see
You're living out this lie
For the rest of your mortal life
Can't you fucking see
Stop living with that lie
Imaginary emotions
For someone that you cared for
Someone who isn't but was
It's just your own bitter loss
A tumor of mould
Inherits you inside
Spreads in you
Soon to putrefy
Convulsion sets in
Relentless aggrieve
Stench of decay
Starts possessing visibility
Putrid stench
Infected body
Slowly putrefies
Heading for death
Flesh turns out to be mould
About these symptoms
You were never told
Decomposed to shreds
Bodily debris
Coagulated blood moulded flesh
Surrounded by disease
Recently died
But limbs are moving anyway
Thoughts have ceased
But you scream in hysterical rage
People put to death in the name of God
And blood run red in an eternal flood
Millions of corpses lying in the cemeteries
Reek of christianity
Down of obscuration
The birth of insanity
And death to liberation
Lord of evolution
Enslavement emperor
Root of all evil
It is the holy terror
God the almighty  The creator of Earth
So what It shall be written on your grave
The bell summon its slaves to mass
In the darkest hour
To devour the body of Christ
The blood feast shall increase their power
Chalices filled to the edge with blood
Drawn from holy veins
Tearing his stomach open
And revel in the shredded remains
Smell the putrid stench
Of the godblessed crucifixion
And discover the lies
There is no resurrection
Get your eyes open wide
And discover the lies
See the truth beyond
The shadows of a false paradise
You remember when he stuck
That hair curler up
Her wet and juicy hair pie
He was laughing like hell
While she was screaming in pain
It was the way he wanted her to die
Carnal leftovers on the floor
If you had come a little earlier
You would have seen some gore
He's staring down
He took her breath
Leaving a carnal stench behind
He'll be curious to search for clues
Carnal leftovers The only thing to find
Carnal leftovers on the floor
If you had come a little earlier
You would have seen some gore
He's staring down
He took her breath
Leaving a carnal stench behind
He'll be curious to search for clues
Carnal leftovers The only thing to find
Calling for me
just to see your blood smeared on your face
and then splattered on me
Haunted haunted
I begin to see
Why I need to kill
my lust for your pain
is my reason to be
slicing your veins
feeling your blood spray
all over my face
Scream for me
I have to kill you to fulfill my needs
Reduce your form to a vomitous mass
Carnage and entrails all over
I force your corpse to bend over
now my urge has tripled
I have to feel you on me
Dead fuck me
I had to kill you to fulfill my needs
Now I must fuck you to enhance the deed
Blood smeared on my hard cock
then smeared on your ass
Reduce your form to a vomitous mass
I cum on your face
spew my tainted seed
Rub it on your fucking tits you whore
you died for me
I think I like how you please me
Now that your a gory fucking mess
I'll keep your carcass ready
for a fuck anytime
I feel you next to me
Claiming my next victim for a filthy feast
Nauseating hunger for human feces
These lesion ridden cunts mean nothing to me
Unhealthy hunger escalating from the stench
Fortified fudge packed full of nutrients
Sexually abusing nursing home patients
As they shit themselves
I gorge on the caustic mess
Violently consuming shit
Pulverizing my fist in your fuckin' face
Undying love for the blackened fluids of stiffs
Boiling blood and brains of my victims bleed
Necrocopromaniac pestilential being
Haemorrhoidal veins rupture slick secretions
Upon my tongue sanguinary analingus
Sucking on their cunts till they burst
How I love it when they bleed on me
Fist fucking diseased anal cavities
Killing is what keeps me sane
Coprophagia
I kill motherfuckers everyday
let these hordes of dead fucks unite
To mutilate the human species
I take pride in killing
Extremely aroused by the sight of fucking pain
cumming on their infected bed sores
Rectally Rectally
Bleeding I sodomize the elderly
Spewing Spewing
Rapidly Rapitly A bed pan bonappetite
despoiling despoilment
raping these elderly pieces of shit
while slobbering sewage how sweet it is
toothless and sick swallowing cum
my blistering pecker seeps
Now my dicks wrapped with disease
What the fuck my cock now bleeds
Haemorrhaging  Blood drips on my feet
Sticking to your encrusted sheets
Wallowing  In pools of steaming shit
Inhaling the stench of filthiness
Bleed for me
Terrorizing me
The elderly have turned against me
Slowly
They creep to me like filthy zombies
Old bitches sliding sewing needles in my dick
Chewing on my filthy meat within
lacerating every inch of my flesh
bleeding slow my body bloats
pulverizing their fists in my fuckin' face
Creeping through the dark streets
Enter the morgue with a hunger for meat
Fuck the newly deceased I need the ones
that have been dead for ten weeks
Tearing and gashing a limbless torso
Voraciously stuffing my face with gray flesh
The next victim of aids
This feast will be held indiscriminately
Moving from corpse to corpse puncturing
Violently biting chomping gnawing on filthy meat
I begin to feel bile collect in my throat
This liquid filled infant is sure to please me
I thrust my red knife in its half decayed chest
I'll begin with the heart then devour the rest
Coughing up rancid pieces of meat
Pus drip my hose I start to feel weak
I proceed to vomit this gutwrenching feast
My insides along with the festering meat
A chunk of intestine lodged in my throat
blood pours from my face as I approach death
Blood churning out of my face
and spilling on the floor
The pain intense yet I still hunger for more
As I fall dying I grab handfuls of tainted meat
I must gorge engorge these putrid steaming
mounds of flesh
Choking on the flesh of the dead
Insanity is my disease 
I lie dead amongst carnage
but this feast isn't complete
the vermin and maggots
will consume what's left of me
rats gnawing bugs crawling
my dirty flesh is the feast
these insects and rats will reduce me to bones
I raid a fresh grave to satisfy my thrill
I fuck the fucking shit out of her filthy neck
Fluids from her stiff vagina seep
Parasites proceed to enter my pulsing pecker
Gnawing their way through me
Hundreds of maggots nesting in my nut sack
Horrible hybrid from the unseen
Fuck this crude larvae
Pissing blood and pieces of meat
A small price to pay for my crimes
Tickling from my dick into my own hand
She agrees to fuck me before I take her life
Her screams of pain turn into moans of pleasure
As I pound at her blood soaked slit
She begs me to deliver my seed
From my red cock the scavengers seep
In the womb grows my young offspring
Tortured and defiled as I impregnate
Embodied in my victim hate bred spawn
Nine months newborn enraged angered
Inhuman infant of my incarnation
Countless corpses litter the streets
There's no stopping my sick offspring
widespread murder rape breeds sickness
Man is the endangered species
Scream inducing pain torments me
from beneath my skin
Torturous jolts like needles
piercing my intestines
I must release these vile insects
from inside of me
With mighty force I plunge it in to
eradicate the source of pain
Now the pain has tripled
yet I begin to feel bliss
Perhaps these insects were
a trick played in my mind
The more pain the more pleasure
I start to become aroused
blood drains from my veins
I reach in and pull my guts out
My cock is fully aroused
I wrap my intestines around it
slowly I begin to jerk
pleasure unlike I've ever felt
My hand and my pulse move faster
With my free hand I scrape out my insides
I know this will cause my demise
But ill die with cum on my hands
With fiendish delight
I spew a load unlike I've ever seen
But I still breathe and feel and uncanny energy
Proceeding to consume these cum stained guts
now makes sense to me
Now I'm full and just came
there's only one thing to do
Slash my neck carve out my chest
then force it into my ass
And to complete this carnage
I slice off my gore soaked dick
I'll have to get my knife
are controlling me
I need a cunt around my dick
I need fresh blood
The voices tell me to kill
I find one and stab her repeatedly
hears her screams
I beat her I smash my fist in her face
Now the fucking fun will begin
I slide my hard cock right in
What a feeling it is
to feel her still warm dead skin
Her limp body still bleeds profusely
with my knife I slice her pretty face
I cant stop laughing
My blood drenched cock is pounding so hard
It tears up the skin on my dick
I breathe heavy mouth is open
By mistake I swallow blood I have an idea
Chunks dripping from my chin
I will eat her cunt next
Spread open your legs 
I slide in my wet blade
My dick is so hard my skin is ripping
Her blood sprays in the air like a fountain
Never in my life have I felt such pleasure
My heart is pounding
Killing is what I'm made for
Now I am full another idea
I must take shit on this fucking bitch
I let one fly onto her face
I then lean down and kiss this bitch
The smell is insane shit flows in my veins
It matters not my cock is now hard again
I jerk off with shit on my hands
Lust still fills me in time ill do this again
Again I must kill again 
Devour the disease filled scourge
that lurk beneath society
lepers that spread filth will bleed all over me
the meat of the healthy no longer does it for me
Crusty brown tainted meat seems to appeal to me
fuck these decrepit ass walking filth factories
My hunger profound its blood is brown not red
it struggles to breathe
air bubbles emit from its neck
I gnaw at its face the stench makes me wretch
With anxious glee I puncture its torso
tearing from its neck to its asshole
inhumanly liquefied insides they've been rotting
inside for such a long time
its fucking filthy heart is still pounding
I grab a handful of the seeping brown insides
and gorge the whole fucking slop in no time
I peel off large pieces of its
crispy flesh place it in my mouth
it makes me gag but I must feast
as I bite down I feel the crusty scabs pop
I proceed to slice off my fingers then my feet
the pain is oh so lovely
Half dead I lie with a smile
from ear to bloody ear
my heart weakens and my vision fades to black
But I still hear the sounds
of blood drip from my own wounds
Scum fucking bitch cum guzzling whore
eating the dick like a revolving door
you suck on my cock but don't swallow shit
your nothing but a worthless ass bitch
So you've been raped beaten and stabbed
Body contorts rip you in half
I defecate on your blood splattered mass
Defiling the corpse suffer in death
Evisceration  rape the bloody whore
Ripped up body  now I crave for more
Endless suffering  I will rape you in the ass
Skin forsaken bruised and naked
My hands are shaking I will kill again
Stalking the dark shroud of night
to claim a victim for my crypt
severed heads decorate the lair
which I'm on with sin
Grinding chunks of flesh into
a red and meaty paste
Feasting on these bitches pieces
soothes my minds decay
Come unto me objects of mindlessness
torture's too good for you 
Read into my ghastly deeds
and encounter sickness
slaughter of disease filled whores
Filth this world don't needThat Is I
This is what you feed
For I am he who shall not bleed
You should be writing this to me
I'm always just the same as you
It's not the worm for who I bleed
In sickness turning what I need
Take a look upon the surface
Have a peak at what is born
You're all just the same as me
You're all that I don't wanna be
Twisting aching in the flood
A glimpse of tearing what's inside
A shadow world I can collide
You're alive and so am I
I can not breathe I fear to try
As I trembled
The walls came down in fear
Hello misery
Your company is here
And the temptation starts
To bleed my empty heart
As I froze
I all came out hollow
Greeting fire
Are you the one to follow
Drained and useless
As I came for you
Unto others
Come be my shadow
Feed upon me
Until I'm vanquished
Demon caller
Breathing down my throat
I don't wanna care I don't wanna know
Getting shot in the head by your own weapon
Get your spite for free and your sins erased
In times of pain in times of rain
Contain the emptiness
Apply the loneliness in me
Try to speak with something dead
Allow the weak to shake its head
Would you kill for me or just for free
I can be as dead as one can be
When they all can breathe we all will suffer
When they all are dead we cannot live
So shake that head until it's empty
Hello I'm dead and so are you
Did you see that episode where they all dies
Did you catch that star where they all cried
I'm talking to you
A paler shade of white a darker side of black
The longing spreads its solemn wings
I flew beyond the realms of light
To bury deep my hellish self
To cleanse my stains and reap the soul
Fearless  No one is pure
Timeless _ I've got no cure
I'm closer to heaven
I close my eyes
Hell is within
I heal my cuts an hide my anguish
Crawling through the precious night
This is where I must belong
This is it prove me wrong
In silence dark the hours haunt
Reveals this anger from above
Fear not is what is said
Time wont heal it will just stop
I am on a spree counting back wards
I'll be shooting angels in heaven
When I'm only on my knees I'll be bleeding
When I'm catching fire I'll be laughing
Getting closer
Fire's breathing
Stains of black burst
Your one desire
Gone too far away
Loading minds astray
The fury is deranged
Something's dragging me
Wearing out my fingers on the walls now
Tearing out the sorrow in reverse now
Come watch the hollow in my eyes now
Winning is for others not for me now
The angels started trembling and the earth moved
I can hear the dark can you
Every other word seems to me by
My face is twitching still nothing
Am I loosing it
Has time passed yet
Did you close your eyes before you left
Did you get a closer look upon it all
Should I kill an see
A different death another life
I can hear the dark
Can you
I can face the light
Did you
So calm so still
So clean so dark
Present I am invincible
Nothing passes through
To e above all that you're fearing
Is the least that you are bearing
Instant falling
Insert repeating
Going deeper
Out to get me
So you're out to get me are you
Two steps to the left
Could be the inches last
To be left on the other side
Looking back through the glass
Can you hold me back  Save me
Am I left to crack  Release me
In the eyes oft he strong man
You're not refused to faults
Because behind the common lies
Lies the trail where you are going deep
Presence fading
Slowly increasing
Lights switching
My sky is nothing
Everchanging
Clean and tasteless
Closely waiting
Manmade mania
Nothing ever is
Nothing ever
Ever
IS
Nothing ever is
Gently walking
Termites terrain
Straying marked
For mastery unknown
Branded inside
Nameless multitude
Dark and hollow
I'm on standby
I've been waking up in oceans
Drying myself blindfolded
Breathing the sinners air
Laughing in the face of being
Am I really leaving
They say that my departure
I denied by myself
I've been sleeping deep in snow
Lonesome at the bottom
Alone at the mountain top
Staring slowly at the world
I've been dying for some time now
Can't you feel it breathing
It's lovely on the ground
Lovely as it sleeps
The was is pure and newly sown
The moon is in the eye oft he strangers mind
Collective thoughts that drives us blind
It's nothing more than a pale old disbelief
Into the light
Into the white
The was is whipping out your life
From the past
From the dark
The was is whipping out your life
It does not weaken as the mind seem to forget
The was is all coming back out of proportion
There's an utmost stir blocking my inside out
A fall which do not have a place to land
Where can this clear get it's feeding through
It's eating me out from the outside in you
Way to shine
Shining way to bright
Way to shine
Staring right through me
Right through me
A feel from yesterdays test completes my fire
Say you're sorry and fade to black
It lights it up as my sight grows pale
A darkness in the light which cant be true you
With eyes closed the reflection feels
aus GÃÂÃÂ¶ttersicht von oben nur
Mit Schnabel eis'gen Wind durchschneidend
flog ich Vogel war
Sehnsucht Fremde die ich bin
Sehnsucht Schmerz und Fremde
Einst zog ich meine Kreise
hoch zur Sonne auf
sah das schÃÂÃÂ¶ne helle Lichte
Kam dem Rad so nah
es zog mich nÃÂÃÂ¤her
In diesen Armen mich verfing
gebrochen stÃÂÃÂ¼rzte fiel
Schmerzen Schreie LÃÂÃÂ¼fte mein
Geliebte LÃÂÃÂ¼fte mein
Mit Schnabel eis'gen Wind durchschneidend
flog ich Vogel war
Sehnsucht Fremde die ich bin
Sehnsucht Schmerz und Fremde
Ich fand mich einst zu Boden wieder
Mutter mir so fremd und fern
HÃÂÃÂ¤lt mich grausam
greift fest wo meine FlÃÂÃÂ¼gel waren
Rad ich dreh mich immer weiter
auf Erden die jetzt Heimat heiÃÂÃÂt
Ferne LÃÂÃÂ¼fte fÃÂÃÂ¼hl ich noch
Mein Wille steigt hinauf zu euch
Fliegen kann was Freiheit ist
Geist schneidet nun die kalte Luft
Den Vogel macht die Feder nicht
SpÃÂÃÂ¼re Sonnen ÃÂÃÂ¼ber mir
Brechen kann was FlÃÂÃÂ¼gel ist
Will im Geiste Adler sein
Ein Alptraum davon dass der Spiegel vergangen
Augenblicke spÃÂÃÂ¤ter entsteht das Verlangen
Den verlorenen Zustand wieder zu erlangen
Eine plÃÂÃÂ¶tzliche Laune der Natur
Beendete jÃÂÃÂ¤h die wÃÂÃÂ¤hrende Ruhe
Das Wasser zuvor Jahr um Jahr erstarrt
Alles hinter einer kristallnen Wand verwahrt
so bot das Eis doch Schutz vor jeder Gefahr
das jetzt bereits das Ufer ÃÂÃÂ¼berwuchert
Bereits haben andere Wesen gemerkt
PlÃÂÃÂ¶tzlich wieder von Leere erfÃÂÃÂ¼llt
Durchdringendes Licht wird doch reflektiert
Ein Wunschtraum davon dass der Spiegel vergangen
Augenblicke spÃÂÃÂ¤ter entsteht das Verlangen
Den jetzigen Zustand ewig zu erleben
Denn unten am Grund da beginnt sich was zu regen
Leben
VerhÃÂÃÂ¤rteter Lehm sprÃÂÃÂ¶de und kalt
Zerfurchtes Gestein fernab vom Wald
Nur graues GestrÃÂÃÂ¼pp auf kargem Grund
Die wenigen BÃÂÃÂ¤ume hier sind bereits alt
Die sterbenden Riesen sie werden zu Stein
Doch wollen sie im Tode eins mit der Ferne sein
Aufbruchsstimmung wird nur mehr gesÃÂÃÂ¤t
Doch noch einmal etwas verÃÂÃÂ¤ndern 
ein allerletztes Mal
So beginnt ein Marsch ohne Wiederkehr
MÃÂÃÂ¼der Schritt gesenkter Blick
Schon bald sieht man nicht mehr nach vorn
Weder nach vorn noch zurÃÂÃÂ¼ck
jeder wird sich opfern bis auf den letzten Mann
Die sterbenden Riesen sie werden zu Stein
Doch wollen sie im Tode eins mit der Ferne sein
Geblieben ist den Riesen kein einziger Anderer
Doch im Innern da ist es immer noch leer
der Kontinent hinter dem Meere einer jeden Bucht
Smash them up Smash them up
Not this PC brigade huh This I do Avow

It wont take long I am not the type to whine
Let me tell you about this late friend of mine
Friendship Loyalty Brotherhood
Few words needed we understood
Sincerity Honesty One of a kind
Offering Qualities which are too hard to find
Despite his age this lad was mature and fair
Life is hard everyone has his own cross to bear
But when he died the bloke was only eighteen
Quite unfair huh Too much still to be seen

Het Wraaksein is gegeven Hij is hun tergen moe
11th of July 1302
11th of July
I'm lost inside your tuf
the faceless demolition
my antichrist rebirth
when stranded in between
reboot me
I'm aiming I hod the trigger I'm your victim
my battle now reformed
it follows my direction
it consumes me whole
it stains my crucifixion
it calms my soul
I'm a target in you distance
your eyes observe my moves
forgivenss through devastation
the penetration drills its hole
sweet obsession dark and cold
chain me in you deep vaults
sweet obsession chills my blood
embrace me in your shade once more
we spill our guts and drain our souls
a broken world refined in sin
we hit and bash to break our bones
brick by brick we crack them stones
as darkness lays its shade
infected wounds fight
we all unite from pain
we are unified insane
intoxicated last in line
losers stand to gain no more
manipulated guided blind
inch by inch abused by all
hang me in sacred gardens
leave my corpse to show
kill me in sacred gardens
breath my empty whole
spill me in sacred gardens
leave my guts to float
end me in sacred gardens
erase all trace from me
the panic seize me through
as the dark side takes control
now the blame towards me
it raptures my soul
we longed for his arise
found the mad man in his eyes
hate regardless towards all
a ruleless battle we fought
die in darkness consume me whole
a vast invasion a last formation
damnation frame no destination train
black is our answer we drown in its shade
when careless I lost my soul
I lost salvation in its cold
how the pain gained control
down tortured us all
one day we will die
in the darkness in the night
lit our fire feel it burn
as time heals no more
we pray for mandatory
protection from its blade
red eyes from blood vision
destruction flames our graves
burn off them leaches
bleed out the filth from your skin
stone all the preachers
hunt them until they all fall
drench them in fire and see them all burn
bow for no masters
loneliness gives you more strength
left is the failure release of the beast
bastards who do you think you are
bastard what is left for me
rotten is what's your lifeline is
we do not need to preach
kill all the weakness
fade all the fear deep inside
clean of the dust
freedom in sight gained control
we spit in the face of the filth
parasites
we burn all your churches
we burn all your lies
cast aside with broken shield
I was abandoned by my god
left as dirt among the lonely race
it painted dark my space
open wound from a dagger hand
left open for no cause
rewinded thoughts I endlessly gazed
I found conviction in it's claws
reunion in war
traumatic point in a useless breath
I'm choking on its curse
faded role into dark absence
I was divided into half
a serpent's sting and a spit within
soon the poison starts its search
open casket headless bones
and my fight revived much worse
it tortures my thoughts
it leaves me in vain
it tortures my nights
it drives me insane
failure and frustration
psychosis warfare
in deepest tombs
our helpless saviors
divide our minds in half
brightless human
mind left blank
emty landscape
runs a sword in thee
utopia gone inside our selves
for nothing we feed our darkest thoughts
distant shallows swarms our inner truths
obliteration frames our naked walls
and stains our memory more
breathe your enemy
loose your sane
target mindways
follows with watching eyes
heartless movement
breathless room
darkened worlds
flamed inside our cells
murder in passion
now death is on its way
shadowed obsession
her darkest obey
muder in passion
intruder found wrong
too dark was her session
then her lonely hours seemed to grow
I dived into her hollow thoughts
I drowned in misery
murder in passion
precede the delete
when facing destruction
no forgiveness she leaves
murder in passion
was hiding among
so cold was our session
soon our passion ceased to grow
so I fell into her holocaust
the construction made me fall
diseased for no sake I burn in open fire
impulsive overdose frantic overload
blood for sacrifice our weakness was our threat
rage at me
throw me against the wall
spill your hate
determination from inside
aim at me
leave me deadly thought
hate your self
its rise is all your fault
its all your fault
who was there to win who released our sorrow
defected symmetry rejected empaty
we found our god impaled
our god lives no more
god for sacrifice we godless faced our death
burn our answers save us from your sins
break the silence bleed the fever more
turn the fire into toxic breed
see the liese and taste our infamy
confession grows
from stains inside of me
as darkness calls
it craves me to reveal
force in the darkness soak in the sin
play with the demons revealed
bestial eruption curse of the plague
bounded protection dissolved
a force sadistic
we found upon its blame
seductive call
our addiction guides us all
reflection throws
its darker side to see
a broken patience
resistance to believe
we broken bastards
pale by our own
our restless fever
has burnt it all
curse on the creature
that seeks and finds us hiding
curse on that creature
that sees our inner deeds
and force us to retreat
beneath the formations in stone
fragements of evil corrode
tragic creation in rust
fire in rain it explodes
inside our dead blind mind
our mutiny unfolds
above the blood red line
it grows
we face the storm we face our death
as dark we form apocalyptic
bringers of pain dark arise
riders of doom now united
crushing and raping our thoughts
we die in our darkness so blind
inside the dead born kind
apocalyptic we find
beneath the darkest sky
Resulting in the human evolution
Modern minds in neandertal bodies
Lost in the sea of ideologies
I swim keeping my head outside
Not to fall in the abyss of the system
You are on my land fucking laws
You impose your ideas
You create fascism
Stage under my reaction
Undergo my anger
Where am I 
Help me to leave emptiness
Limbos
Just want you to spoil my consciousness
Corrupt my thoughts
Follow my doomed path
Don't be a coward
'Cause into a polymorphic perdition I am
Horned totem Horned totem
Panic rushes through my body
Horned totem Horned totem
Wild tribes' beastmen choose me
Exhorting the Hunt dance
Horned totem Horned totem
Panic rushes through my body
Hunt dance as I run
The Beast they say and a Beast I was
Running to escape the human foes
Child I knew how to give
I forgot this virtue
Since I became civilized
As today is artificial
Every beautiful stone was a treasure to my eyes
Every tree that grew was a respected property
Now I corrupt with the Whiteman
In front of a painted landscape
Whose value is estimated in dollars
Eat eat eat
Full of dollars full of business
Full of exploitations full of shit
No digestion without reaction
Avagdu son of mother Earth
Hear my call
Stupid hideous slewering
Dark face of Earthpower
I bless you ÃÂÃÂ great putrid one
Infect odors and mystic auras
Putrid odors from sweet putrefaction
As sickness decomposition
Corruption are part of Nature cycle
You are hungry
Avagdu
No remorse and
No pity in the naive territory
You want to spread
The foundation of our shitworld
Creating the need
Erasing rites and native tribes
Corrupt their minds
And let them be part of our shitworld
The old world is no longer
A new one is born
Mastered by a bipedal opportunist
Who conquers the planet
What has he done 
Is he worth to 
Spreading the consumption plagues
through the naive territory
Corruption living in a dream people
You make them a part of your circle
Full of shit
Circle consumption
Full of shit
Circle of deshumanisation
Want to be the first in the territory
Make them buy for your market
You killed the last tribes of an heavenly dream
New colonisation of territory
Run  Run 
I love my master cause
As I'm no more a dog
Dog Bomb
Straight away is the enemy
Sure he won't love me
At the beginning of times
A man could become a human being if he wanted
And an animal could become a human being
There were no differences
Everybody spoke the same language
In this time words were magic
And the spirit owned mysterious powers
There rose a high idol after many battles
Which was called the CromCruach
He would break any peace between the tribes
He was their god
Crom the withered in thick mists
Those who were frightened
Never would reach the High Kingdoms
There were hurting themselves
There were beating palms
Hammering their bodies
While mourning in the name of the fallen One
Enslaving them
They were shedding endless floods of tear
Nuclear is the way they say
Death goes on its way I say
Unseen unheard we ignore their presence
Nuclear is dissuasion they say
It's a problem of selfesteem I say
Better get rid of it now before
It all explodes in your pretty face
Hiroshima Nagasaki never again they say
Tchernobyl errors will become common I say
I don't want my children to be mutated
Hope Nature will forget
Avoid thinking of your land
Increasing profits from the ground
Devastating woods and forests
For money and forget
Trees and creatures crushed by your diggers
Hope
In a long time ago
Claymored and Fhalkior united
By the anger of their Kings
They had to survive
All the shine of the glory
Was built with the might of steel
This eternal winter
Will not rise
Alliance is the name on our shields
I look at the sky
On crowd dead on the field
This eternal winter
Will not rise
The legions will sing this hymn
United for a single Nation
United for a single Kingdom
We'll fight together
We can't standalone
We're going to fight
Again for the crown
Two kingdoms
One leader one throne
Searching for help
Far from home
The Legacy will not fall
For the proud of our king
Face to face the army of Trolls
All the shine of the glory
Was built with the might of steel
This eternal winter
Will not rise
Alliance is the name on our shields
I look at the sky
On crowd dead on the field
This eternal winter
Will not rise
The legions will sing this hymn
United for a single Nation
United for a single Kingdom
We'll fight together
We can't standalone
We're going to fight
Again for the crown
Two kingdoms
One leader one throne
United for a single Nation
United for a single Kingdom
We'll fight together
We can't standalone
We're going to fight
Again for the crown
Two kingdoms
One leader one throne
Hail the Blacksmith 
We came from the Alliance
Beyond the hills
Where is the Blacksmith who lives here
In the end of path a dungeon exist
But take care my friend he is a freak
Hail the blacksmith 
Crossing Helderville we found the one
Are you the blacksmith We're looking for
Demon of steel my army is here
We need your services to save the king

My magic anvil will lead you to victory
Sword of storms and Hammer of the evil
My mortal steel will destroy your enemy
He is the Blacksmith
Power of Thunder
Made of steel
With the sword of storms you can control
Hurricanes and winds to protect the throne
With the hammer of evil
Brandishing in your hands

Locked in his dungeons
Three days and three nights
With his hammer and anvil Forging the strike
Will shed the blood
Hail the blacksmith

My magic anvil will lead you to victory
Sword of storms and Hammer of the evil
My mortal steel will destroy your enemy
He is the Blacksmith
Power of Thunder
Made of steel
The Blacksmith 
Hail the blacksmith 
The Legend tells about this sea
Thousands of squadrons destroyed in the mist
All the Black Hawks are waiting the strike
When a ship arises ready for the fight
Evil pirates 
Cannons bright in the flames
In the Devil's Throat
Storm of blades
The force of Alliance is down
The Generals attack for the proud of the crown
Evil pirates 
The eyes of the Holy Ghosts hunting in the sea
Searching for blood and fire
Dragon Heart is coming beside winds and rain
Ghost Galleon
Screams of Revenge
Ghost Galleon
Spectrums of Rage
Ghost skulls in the dark
Killing the crew with the magic steel
Vision of hell in the earth
Lost crusade the ocean is the grave
Evil pirates 
Your honor is the key Dragon Heart
We'll lead your army
'Til the coast apart
Keep your journey with proud
Beware with the storm
And you'll never fall
Evil pirates 
The eyes of the Ghosts hunting in the sea
Searching for blood and fire
Dragon Heart is coming beside winds and rain
With the sword of storms the power of Hurricane
Ghost Galleon
Screams of Revenge
Ghost Galleon
Spectrums of Rage
Sailing in the ocean in the ghost galleon
Fighting across the midnight sea
Third Voice  We don't gonna be destroyed
We will fight for freedom
The eyes of the Ghosts hunting in the sea
Searching for blood and fire
Dragon Heart is coming beside winds and rain
With the sword of storms the power of Hurricane
Ghost Galleon
Screams of Revenge
Ghost Galleon
Spectrums of Rage
For the honor for the glory
For the alliance for the king
For the honor for the glory
For the alliance for the king
What do you want
We want your blood
The blood of your cowards
So feel our sword
Do you want to fight
Welcome to my realm
Get into the battle
Taste our steel
On the mountains where the armies fight
Welcome to my realm
Where the spells reign above the steel
On the top of the hill
The battle has begun
Knights and armors
Bright with the sun
Mountain of the rising storm
The curse floats on the wind
Mountain of the rising storm
We are afraid to get lost in the mist
Get down to my spell
I never give up
You can't win
My revenge will begin
You've got nothing
I'll show you your death
Don't urge my anger
You're my guest
The destiny castle
Is under the siege
Get down on your knees
And get surrender
In the name of King
When the battle has begun
The violence was spread everywhere
The alliance army fought with honor and proud
The legions were falling but the Dragon Heart
Deep in the forest
Down the trees
So dark and so cold
We cry the end of our king
Hurt and tired
Laid down on the field
We heard the last breath
His spirit dancing in the wind
Goodbye my brother
King of the kings
Your braveness and wisdom
The bards will sing
You'll be remembered
Majesty and hero
Fly like a hawk
In this sad tale of the kingdom
Fly high to the sky
My king my pride
Don't be afraid to rest
In your grave in the west
If we had a way
To bring back Theodoric
I swear to Gods
We will face the trip
One elf told me in the past
About the Hall
Where the spirits of the knights
Return from the Death
Goodbye my brother
King of the kings
Your braveness and wisdom
The bards will sing
You'll be remembered
Majesty and hero
Fly like a hawk
In this sad tale of the kingdom
Fly high to the sky
My king my pride
Don't be afraid to rest
In your grave in the west
Now we are crying
In the circle of the knights
Remember our victories
When we fought with pride
You were a great warrior
You were the lord of war
The sky turned black
You fell in the hands of death
Inside of this hall
Secrets and dangers behind the walls
Lighting the dark room
The warriors' spirit hail the Crown
Hall of dead knights
Twilight of your dreams hiding my sins
Hall of dead knights
Bringing the hymn to our army believe
Devastation of the horizons
From the old graves from the ancient ages
The death burying the death
Into secret chamber
The death burying the death
Into secret chamber
Brave souls of the hall
The resurrection of the king
Don't let us fall
Brave souls of the hall
The resurrection of the king
Don't let us fall
Remember my friend
The souls don't turn back
This is the last chance
With the magic power brake the Death
Hall of dead knights
Beyond your dreams carrying the hymns
Hall of dead knights
Storm of the Spells in the wind
Don't go against the lifetime
You can't win the power of the gods
But if you trust in your heart
Just try if you want
The death burying the death
Into secret chamber
The death burying the death
Into secret chamber
Brave souls of the hall
You brought back our king
We won't give up
Brave souls of the hall
You brought back our king
We won't give up
Don't let us fall
Traitor
You had no reasons to tell anyone
Liar
Risking the fate of the throne
Judas
Selling the lives of your brothers in arms
Betrayer
Destroying the plans of the Crown
Sons of Claymored
Sons of Fhalkior
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
This journey has no return
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
We will never break the oath
Bring him to me
I want to know
Why did he tell
Before we go
Traitor
In the Greyhawk tavern he lost his mind
Liar
His greed will change our lives
Judas
Now we'll have to prepare our armies
Betrayer
We are not afraid to die
Sons of Claymored
Sons of Fhalkior
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
This journey has no return
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
We will never break the oath
So came the moment
About Fellstrought
Our time is out
We have to go
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
This journey has no return
Betrayal in the Coast of Raven
We will never break the oath
Forgive me my king
Tell me your sin
I've failed with my faith
Join us in this crusade
Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
They came from everywhere
Marching down on the hill
Kill kill pay the price
It's time for sacrifice
Archers and cavalry
Screams of Agony
Fight Fight spirits of knights
Let set us free
And the Dark Valley burns
Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
Metal against the metal
Our proud stands still
Fire ripping the air
Falling down from the sky
Die die winged knights
Our revenge will come with might
Under the red sky
The battle is close to end
Run Run surrender in pain
We'll wait for you again
And the Dark Valley burns
Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
Metal against the metal
Our proud stands still
Metal against the metal
Bleeding the steel
Metal against the metal
Our proud stands still
Many dangers and mysteries
The trooper is under fire
Brave warriors rest in peace
Bless us from the sky
Adventures we can see
Changing our destiny
Rising force
Come with me
Glories and Pride
Dragons and Kings
And my magic swords
Creatures and Plagues
We've destroyed
Listen to the wind
Heroes of the realm
Keep the magical ring
Sunrise in the Akronis Sky
Over the Mountains
The Dragon Survives
I need your help
And your blade
Great Akronis Kingdom
Join us my friends
In our crusades
Staying by my side
We'll return to expel
The creatures and the evil
March warriors
Fight for freedom
Write the tale tonight
Dragons and Kings
And my magic swords
Creatures and Plagues
We've destroyed
Listen to the wind
Heroes of the realm
Keep the magical ring
Sunrise in the Akronis Sky
Over the Mountains
The Dragon Survives
We can't see where the rain comes
We are so far from the rainbow
Come great leader
Take your throne
The Kingdom of the Alliance
Conclame your return
Rumours know that rebellion will break out
crown no doubt
Armed and ready stand
My rights I must defend
Steel is in my hand
The clan's are marching 'gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory I will find
Rebellion on my mind
The town of Edinburgh fell soon in our hands
All Recover
Darkness
Darkness embrace
Darkness unfolds
Unraveling a world of betrayal
In the form of a void
Consuming the notion of reality
Consuming the life of the innocent
What is this place
what keeps me standing on my feet
I beg for numbness to ease the weight
That leashes me to this deceit
The ages could be passing
There's no sun to light my days
So this is what they do
To let their guilt die with you
All just lies
Lashed by fear of going where there's no return
Where theres no return
What's left of myself
Of myself
Weights on your hand so like a grain of sand
Waiting
I will be waiting
Waiting
I will be waiting for you to come
For you to come and
save me from this dream
Wake me up take me out lead me and
love me the way you used to do
I'm tied up I'm stuck in my own consciousness
Hope's a mystery
If a life can be brought down so easily
I don't wanna know what I am
Face
'Though you cannot see the way
My demons
Beyond the prison I remain
Anguish has its way to turn into demons
And their faces look so friendly
All of them smile
As they carry their knives
'Though you cannot see the way
Life is just ahead
Beyond the prison I remain
Locked from my own death
'Though you cannot see the way
Life is just ahead
Beyond the prison I remain
Locked from my own death
All just lies
Lashed by fear of going where there's no return
What's left of myself
Weights on your hand so like a grain of sand
Come on come on now
Let out your suicidal intent
Frozen and Lethargic
Show us the hero you are
Underestimate the foe and the chosen one
The darkest music calling me home
and yet they're reclaiming the throne
This is an invitation
Cast the spell and erase yourself
Come dance and see
Come dance and see  they said
Oh god why have Thou forsaken me
To let everything die with me for a glance
To let everything die with me for a glance
And in a dance were laid low
Ask our hope for a last chance
They said go And that means No
To let everything die with me for a glance
And in dance we're laid low
Cant deny one last dance
I said go and that means NO
I can see clearly that there is nothing
to see I can reach easily
what never existed
Wounded displaced rotting bleeding dead
Wounded displaced rotting bleeding dead
To let everything die with me
Die with me
And in a dance were laid low
Ask our hope for a last chance
They said go And that means No
To let everything die with me
And in a dance were laid low
Cant deny one last dance
I said go and that means NO
Cold dreams
Disturbed by the warmth of light
Awaken the stone in sweet temptation
A cosmic invite to deny
A stone's complete annihilation
Hope
I withhold the air I can no longer wait
Now that I know that I'm not insane
for in my pain
I was given a sign
So bright a light
it has to be mine
and it's otherworldly glow
It could carry me
through a life time
of anger and gloom
Oh
Its calling and taking me home
how
How could we be dying alone
now
Its calling and taking me home how
How could we be dying alone now
The sight of this broken body
is killing me
The Sun has enough
strength to pry this door open
Open
The sight of this broken body
is killing me
Killing me
I'm just an amusement for you
And so I fell for you
Hope's just a word to make believe
This world is obscene
A call to insanity
Love makes it all go hand in hand
with defeat
And it will take you down
I took the blame and all was taken away from me
Taken away from me
I took the blame and all was taken away from me
Taken away from me
We're not the same and all was taken away
Taken away from me
Burn burn burn
The entire world has burn down
a thousand times
and rid my heart of your disguise
Turn turn turn
Turn up the volume of the anger
Oh yeah a thousand times
I can't believe the scars so deep a broken heart
a war that comes to be true
So tired we are
I can't believe the scars so deep a broken heart
a war that comes to be true
Unending light
I close my eyes
Rain down on me
Another endless life flash before my eyes
Burn til we're free
Hunting once again and so we pretend to be
Burn burn burn
I can't believe the scars so deep a broken heart
a war that comes to be true
a war that comes to be true
Burn burn burn
I can't believe the scars so deep a broken heart
a war that comes to be true 
a war that comes to be true
Travelling through endless dreams
I promise
I'll search for a reason to all this
All this
Revenge surely will be met
Sooner or later
sooner or later
you'll be dead
Sooner or later
you will be dead
Sooner or later
you will be dead
Rain down on me
Another endless life flash before my eyes
Burn until we're free
Hunting once again and so we pretend to be
I close my eyes
Fall asleep
Burn burn burn
Burn it down to the ground
Burn burn burn
Burn it down to the ground
Burn burn burn
Burn it down to the ground
Burn burn burn
Burn it down to the ground
Burn burn burn
Burn burn burn
Burn burn
Now that you are gone
Now that you are gone 
I know I'm ready to
to leave all behind
to leave all behind now fuck
The sun is set
and you're not coming back for us
I'm leaving all behind
another second spent
in senseless confusion
Fall asleep
Can you see That this is the moment
I feel like I could fly
fly away from here
Let us make the journey
Please take me nowhere near
I wish that I could see
what's real in this world
Am I the only one living
in my empty home
Come find yourself and face reality
always and never
I felt this energy in perfect symmetry
I walk and walk
in an endless circle
Because I fucking hated that dramatic ending
There's not a road to follow
but a distant mirror and I remember my face
I wave my hand and make the world flourish
a naked woman in a sea of red
Freedom and solitude
A nourishment too bittersweet for my taste
But I don't recall its flavor so what do I know
I walk this world alone
with a body made of stone
Life almost feels once more
like something worth fighting for
I'm back to the front
against the enemy
I grow weary of this hunt
for a fantasy inside a fantasy
I'm hanging on the gallows
As her face turns pale
The world shifts and splits
into multiple dimensions
Lifting up the soul
tearing it all down to the ground
Transcend
Believe
Undress the skin of mortality
One step forward
Towards the end of it all
Recover
Past disorder
Relive it forever or
Die for your love
Just turn the pages
until there's neither a man or a lie
I've seen all the possible outcomes
and in all of them you die
Die for your love
before the end of it all
Recover
Past disorder
Relive it forever keep
Moving forward
Hunting the voice inside your head
It's hard to perceive its purpose
Grow higher touch the knowledge that pours
comprehend and obliterate
Olha em teu redor e verÃÂÃÂ¡s que sim
eu sou o estranho que habita em ti
Look around yourself and you'll see
I am the stranger that lives in you
Olha em teu redor e verÃÂÃÂ¡s que sim
eu sou o estranho que habita em ti
Mas eu tenho a soluÃÂÃÂ§ÃÂÃÂ£o pra ti
Look around yourself and you'll see
I am the stranger that lives in you
But I've got the solution for you
One step forward
Towards the end of it all
Recover
One step forward
Towards the end of it all
Recover
Past disorder
Relive it forever or
Die for your love
Transcend
Believe
Undress the skin of mortality
Fall asleep
Die to live
Die to live
Denying all the details
of an enormous adventure
You and I
I keep asking myself why
We are leaves lying on the ground
A broken heart spread all over the fabric
that covers your face
Hiding the scares of your disgrace
hide
Never stop bleeding
never stop bleeding never stop bleeding
And the truth is in the mirror
they know that there can be no hero
and I'll never stop bleeding
Images reflecting watery skies
All buildings erected upon a sea of lies
No one felt the pain the way I did
Nothing was the way you made believe
There was no truth
There was no truth
That was never you
never stop bleeding never stop bleeding
And the truth is in the mirror
they know that there can be no hero
and I'll never stop bleeding
Come see it
and find us
Come see us
never stop bleeding never stop bleeding
never stop bleeding never stop bleeding
And the truth is in the mirror
they know that there can be no hero
and I'll never stop bleeding
never stop bleeding never stop bleeding
there can be no hero
there can be no hero
and I'll never stop bleeding
The mists unveil
revealing the shores of a fictional life
I once thought ours
Concealing my demons
Now I rewind the tape to complete the cycle
complete the cycle
and burn us all down to the ground
Oh I'll take you down
I now share your taste for bitter ends
but this time I'll prevail
I'll take you down
With eyes closed a witness in the scene
where you've become the enemy
Will the anger be
enough to set us free
A world of pain has grown us two
and so I put my trust in you
Now it weights on me
That I'll never be
Coming in colors
in peace like a sea of crimson roses
An ocean of lies
soon my revenge will be quietly revealed
peacefully mercilessly
You couldn't know that I would know
I'm coming for you
The earth around me flowers red
as the light returns
With eyes closed a witness in the scene
where you've become the enemy
Will the anger be
enough to set us free
A world of pain has grown us two
and so I put my trust in you
Now it weights on me
That I'll never be
Tricked by your fucking schemes again
NO
The sun returns slowly
to where it has never been
enlightening my way out
into your nightmare
Oh
I'll take you down
I'll take you down
I'll take you down
I'll fucking take the life out of you
I'll take you down
Open a perfect tomb
Digging an exit wound
Open a perfect tomb
I am a raging sea
The calm before
Before the flood 
This void within me
Can break through and shatter the world
Settling our uneven score
casting out the illusion
that's been leading me astray
Cut my skin open a door
To out of this shit hole
Just you wait and see whats coming to you
Open a perfect tomb
Digging an exit wound
Open a perfect tomb
Tearing down these walls of yours
That you have built upon lies
Lies
Ill wash away
Ready for the war
Craving your demise
My anger will shatter the world
Wound
My wound
Tear the flesh out Ill find my destiny my wound
Tear the flesh out I am your destiny
My wound your tomb
tear the flesh out now
Don't move
Don't breath
I'm the calm before the flood
I am the raging sea
Travelling out these tainted shores
I am a part of your world no more
I am the raging sea
One step forward
All recovered
All just lies
Lashed by fear of going where there's no return
What's left of myself
Weights on your hand
So like a grain of sand

before the end of it all

Alone I'm alone on my desolate Earth
Frozen with despair Adam you lied to me
Soracle you lied to me
I built Edaenia and sealed my cursed grave
Sapped by shame Obsequium Minaris betrayed me
And I weep for my soul's scars
Contaminated the stream of souls was set on fire
I'm lost again
Your cells are mutating in me leave me alone
Reality is in flux I could be somewhere else
I could live another life
Disembodied into nothingness
The face of my father appears to humiliate me
Black hole of power / Temple of hate
Give me Soracle to get him back into hell
Come to me Minarian / I am here marionette
I staked my like on believing in your name
Time means nothing or time is meaningless
I wander between two different universes
I am no more than a star in the sky
Cradle of a new world made of rubbish
Mixing dreams and reality
I am no more than a star in the sky
All is one and one is all
Maelstrom of connecting elements
Embracing absolute nothingness
Melting into useless stripes
Moving to nowhere with purposeless destination
Through time and space
In brotherhood with an abstract presence
In a sphere of absurd vacuum
It has always been a deep black hole
Trying to find an aim to all this
Unconscious of a cosmic plan
Distant from uncountable centuries away
And the time had come
There was just nothing and then it was there
Then darkness disappeared
Far from the random shapes of nature
Beyond the bounded knowledge of men
Shining in a morning sun
It was standing beautiful
An artefact raised at the horizon of Earth
A sense and a purpose to the being
From beyond the infinite and further
A non understandable communication
Messenger of what was once
Still is and will ever be
Past and future at the lowest point of the scale
Waiting to be reached a clue from above
A mean of colonisation through the aeons
Through the aeons
Self confident intelligent species
For an unreachable and inexorable goal
Nothing was random a beast known as mankind
Evolution through ageless times
A monolith as message
For the sake of what
I am standing
Reflects the profile of an innocent infant
He used to escape from the world crying
And now he cannot belive it's the end
In his glittering glance the life passes
His shadow sinks under the water
As if here the earth and the sky ended
On the corner of a dark room
I silently begin the first steps of a new life
I build the walls of my loneliness alone
Where the darkness swallows the light 
Where the wall up to the sky does not allow
Your words to light a new candle
In the cold corner the reminder of your picture
Or the stars of the hot summer sky
Where for me the angel left her cold body behind
Walls surround me that i built
When i was a child brick by brick
This world disappointed me
The child is gone i am only gazing
My gregish temple reminds me
That i can depart bound for the unseen
In the cold corner the reminder of your picture
Or the stars of the hot summer sky
Where for me the angel left her cold body behind
Dawn found me lying on the ground
As soon as the night passed away
And the wind among the trees
Is watching me as a hunted game
I feel cold on the dewy field
Where my mind found me
I fear in the early morning light
That death was banished by
My reflection struggle
Like frightened birds in the silence
While i'm scared looking for
My lost memories
Black veil of the night
Still keeps me confined
When i scream and lift up
My bloody hands to the sky
To redeem has gone the dawn
But inside myself is still raging the night
I'm dancing with the devil
By moonlight
In the mask of madness 
Two minutes before midnight
In the world of shades
my soulles body
Is wandering through the night
And as a humanfaced monster
Is looking for his sacrify
The everything  devouring cold darkness
Is surrounding like an icy  ocean my heart
I'm dancing with the devil
By moonlight
In the mask of madness 
Two minutes before midnight
In the world of shades
Soflty ripples the dark river
I can see the moon among the branches of trees
At this dark summer night
I feel clear
Suddenly from the deep
Distress of thousand years is heard
Sketching a purple face before me
A hand motions asking me to come
I'm flying across the end of existence
And lost sight of calm lands
Suddenly from the deep
Distress of thousand years is heard
Sketching a purple face before me
In an obscure  blue room
A child's voice is burning me
I'm painting on his body in red
His dead face is the first step
To an unknown deep
At the door of the new world
I feel what hides in me forever
To create a new like in a new universe
Cold obscurity falls on me
Into my soul the winter to return
Whips of the storm shivered i hear
I waited for you but you didn't come
Monotomy of misterious stars
Hit a nail to the coffin of dusk
My soul has crashed down under the beats
Just the loneliness gives shelter to me
A not happened embrace a not happened kiss
One face what charms me in the dark
My knees hit the floor it was a moment only
I'm sleeping i will wake up somewhere else
I can't smell the scent anymore
That her skin breathed above silk pillows
I hate when i feel
That the world
Turns its back on me
And just the loneliness
Gives shelter to me
I feel that the wild burning desire
Is calmed by the steps of happines
The bright shinning rising sun is nice to me
When the first ray comes and rests by my side
Bride of darkness stood before me
Between walls and doubts
I hate when i feel
That the world
Turns its back on me
And just the loneliness
Gives shelter to me
The valley where i can feel the infinite
Cold touch of time forever
The valley which leans over me to defend
And i lived there as a slave
She became my mother and father
And the only one who really knows me
And when i close my eyes forever
She will known why i do it
The valley where the sky is faraway
I sometimes leave for her on a path
But flow is coming and sweeping away
don't run away  whispers the wind
The valley only can hear my last words
Among the flowers fed with loneliness
The valley where in my own world
I live alone
Now i say goodbye i'm waited in the sky
The valley where in my own world
I live alone
Nobody can see my smile
Nobody can see my tears
The night's an offspring of black dreams
Everything's dark the shades on the walls
Invite me
The memory of my dreams is a distant light
The wind groans the sign of my soul
The night embraces me
You've taken everything away
You've only left an empty snap
And this words that are dead since ages
The could universe
Has sticked to my face
The wishes have died somewhere
I'm only lying in the silence
The hours elapse on
Every memories are taken away by the dimness
My soul's dancing in a redhot fire
Shine upon the Earth with my light
Your face like a thousand stars
I know this love is never falling apart
I need you
You need me
I want you to need me
I breath you
Will you breath me
I want you to love me
I want to be the ice in your winter
Freeze on your forehead when youre running
Your face like a million dreams
I know our love will never fall apart
I feel you
You feel me
I want you to need me
I breath you
Will you breath me
I want you to love me
Would you want me to hold on
To something far beyond my reach
I dream my dreams
I know our love
I know our love will never tear us apart
Ive got my arms open
I left you a heart wide open
It has passed form man to man
But I love you in the way only I can
If you can solve me
Mend me whole
Cry with me
I know you can solve me
Baby youve got your eyes open
When youre asleep theyre open
You skim from land to land
But Ill find you on the edge of a dead end
If you can solve me
Mend me whole
Breathe with me
Sigh with me
Cry with me
I know you can solve me
You can stay alive with me
You can solve me
Play alive with me
Come on solve me
I know you can solve me
I need to lay down in the water
Close my eyes to hear my heart beat
I need to get a little closer
To myself to know why Im breathing
I am near now
I am here
I feel it gather rainbows in the deep
Silence in the deep
You may hear but you cant see
My visions of eternity
Silence in the deep
I dream of crystalline water
Because I think but I cant speak
My prayers are hidden in the water
If I could I would make you believe
This is what weve got
Heaven wash me free
All that weve ignored
Is here inside me
I am near now
I am here
I feel it gather rainbows in the deep
Silence in the deep
You may hear me but you cannot see
My visions of eternity
Silence in the deep
I want to be silent
I need silence
Can you hear me
I want to be silent
I need silence
Silence in the deep
You turned a stone into a flower
Behind the wall there was me
I learned to weep on your shoulder
How could silence be so sweet
Glitter shoes on dirty pavement
Trip up on a Thursday girls night out
I can see the light shine through
And the floor is drowned in red white blue
Neon lights
Moving lips in ecstasy
I can feel your heart beat chasing me
Dior scent
For a moment of delight
For a moment of your sweet mean bite
Chase the guys
Cause I need yes I need and I cant deny
Vanilla skin delight
Vanilla skin
Delight tonight
Vanilla skin
I cant deny
Growing love around the corner
Hot sweet sticky naked shoulder Im yours
I can sense the need in you
To become the star in all eyes view
Neon lights
Move your hips in ecstasy
I can hear your heart beat wanting me
Dior scent
For a moment of delight
I will curse you for your sweet mean lies
Chase the guys
Cause I need yes I need and I cant deny
Will I calm down now
Feel the warm ground now
But what if there is poison in my tea cup
A hole in the bath tub sucking me down
What if a man is knocking on my blue door
And I shouldnt have trusted him
Hes got an evil core
Oh you cause me panic
Im drowned in pale white
Cause I dont wanna be here but I cant get out
Because you make me panic and I cant
What if youre a hunter youd want my blood 
And I just didnt see it cause I fell in love
Im gonna build good fences to keep them out
What if I see your faces sticking
On the pane at night
What of youre the hunter youd want my blood
Do you want my blood
Blood panic blood panic
You make me panic
Le piano play
Im doing faire de la musique
Cheesy piano play off to the funky beat
Le rock dosent fascinate me too much tonight
Im just a maniac
Paris Paris you are my physical attraction
My melody on the radio en direct
Paris cherie I want your physical attraction
La chanson make you feel plusqueparfait
Olala the French girls
Le bass I like 
Lets go to the la boum
Cheesy hooklines kick off to the funky beat
This is tres tres bien for my popstyle touch
Im taking my melody a Paris for the maniacs
Cause Im a maniac
I think Im talking to myself
Hello stranger hello friend
Its just a touch of madness
Nothing serious to blame
Were all living in our flawless world
Afraid to fail ashamed by blame
Will I ever be the same if I apologize
I love you to pieces yeah
Im sorry Im sorry
You love me to pieces yeah
Let me in
Its me again
I cursed you
Let me in
Im sorry
Just make me whole again
Im in pain Im sorry
I stepped on your identity
If you ignore me
I better wait for rain
Wait for rain
My pain is not mutable
Your voice is overloading me
And my bad burning conscience is killing me
I better wait for rain
Wait for rain
I love you to pieces
You love me to pieces
We better we better wait for rain
Creeping upon me at night
Like a numb shadow
Calling my echoing mind
Armor forced aside
Why am I here within sight
Of your crime
Oh this is my fate
Loves going to die
Copious tears that fall
Leaving winding scars
Innocent painful grief
Shining in your eyes
Why am I here within sight
Of your crime
Oh this is my fate
Loves going to die
Why are we here 
Between love and hate
Oh is it too late
Loves going to die
This is our fate
Our love is a crime
This is our fate
Love is a crime
I dont need your lies 
Cause you dont impress me you see
The ice is getting thin
Time to turn around and go home
I wont fight this war for you
All I do is passing through in your life
I tell you its over tonight
Libertine you are like stardust in the rain
Illusion fades
Youre just one shadow in this game
Libertine you think youre free
But your heart is chained
Its just an illusion
A pale illusion of what life really is
I dont need your bliss
Cause its not shiny
The nights are getting colder
When youre alone
When youre older
I promised with every breath
With every word I say
Solace and sympathy
You give me all the blame I can take
All you are
All you can take for yourself
All you can give
All I can forgive
Meet me in the red sky
See me cross the water
Ill find you when youre under
Hold you when youre feeling down
Meet me in the great red sky
I get closer with every step
With every prayer I say
Curse my identity
Then paint me all in white Im to blame
I hear him before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's been
I realize he's there
When I turn the light off and turn over
Nobody knows about my man
They think he's lost on some horizon
But suddenly I find myself
Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love 'til eternity
Ooh he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes
Ooh he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes
He's so very understanding
And he's so aware of all my situations
And when I stay up late
He's always waiting but I feel him hesitate
Oh I'm so worried about my man
They say no no no no no it won't last forever
But here I am again my girl
Wondering what I'm doing here
Maybe he doesn't really love me
I just took a trip
Ooh he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes
Ooh he's here again
The man with a child in his eyes
I can hear him knocking
Ooh he's here again
I can hear him knocking
Man with a child in his eyes
Oh he's knocking at my front door
And he's breaking my heart
Ooh he's here again
Man with a child in his eyes
But I love him yes I do
Ooh he's here again
Just a man just a man
Man with a child in his eyes
He's trying to do the best he can
Ooh he's here again
I can hear him knocking
Man with a child in his eyes
And he's trying trying to be a man y'all
Ooh he's here again
He's a child child child child
Darkness made of white downfall frozen grave
Blizzards cast by satans hand diabolic fate
Incredible mass of burial ground coming through
Inverted desert on glacier fields entombs you
No escape no time for panic
Psychotic thought you know you're trapped
Cannot move your dreams go manic
Raging cold and a distant rumble you can't win
White death final breath casked bed of ice
Death comes slow
End of life
End comes slow
Death is life
Darkness made of white downfall frozen grave
Blizzards cast by satans hand diabolic fate
Incredible mass of burial ground coming through
Inverted desert on glacier fields entombs you
With the trees the lawn and the lake nearby
Everything was perfect it wasn't for him
Why didn't you pull the trigger
Why didn't you shoot that pig
The voice in my head keeps asking
As the nauseating pain keeps growing
Chaos degeneration senseless banging on the door
Dishnour thy father pigs a message from below
He's here stay away from him
The ugly priest with his lies
The voice in my head keeps echoing
Look at them the pathetic animals
They'd be better off dead don't you think so
Yes you think so
The voice in my head keeps exhorting
As the nauseating pains keeps growing
You must do it you must do it now
From a time before time
From a land beyond the stars
A war of angels has passed
Back when anu walked the earth
Dark angels now approach
Converting the peace into war
Oh wicked god
Oh wicked demon
Spirit of the sky remember
Oh wicked god
Oh wicked demon
Spirit of the earth rememb
The angels of light are impaled
We hail the age of nominon
We have surivived the first war
Between the power of the gods
We have witnessed the wrath of the ancient ones
On the top of mountains
Beneath the soil of the seas
We are the lost ones
We have survived the wrath
Of good and evil powers
We have spoken to scorpions
But our allegiance was betrayed
Promised never to be attacked again
But the gods are forgetful
We have survived the first war
Between the powers of the gods
Neither of light or darkness
Beneath the world lies sleeping
The deity of Chtulu
Will lead us to victory
To fight immortal foes and gods
That's our destiny surpreme
With winds of war and evil
We allie with demands of hell
We from a race beyond the wanderers of night
Oh wicked god
Oh wicked demons
Before god's creation evil roamed the earth
Countless years awaiting mass rebirth
Sheltered by secret caves while biding its time
Unleashed phantoms descend
Spawned by evil
They feed upon your flesh and sanity
Your morbid nightmares become reality
All hope is lost abandones by Jesus Christ
Extinction at dusk
Chaos in the flesh
Mankind's existence will end before dawn
A pile of rotten corpses a symbol of the war
Enshrouded by hell curtains of might
Inhuman incubator of evil itself
Face the truth the beginning of hte end
Cry out in anguish no one will live to tell
All hope is lost abandoned by Jesus Christ
Extinction at dusk
Chaos no one will live to tell
I find scratching at the coffin lid
Your near ones mourners left long ago
You're all mine now
How I wish you could rise
How I wish you'd look into my eyes
But you stare blindly into the dark
Yet I pretend you're smiling
I need your cold gray skin against mine
Taste your flesh wish mine would taste the same
Panic strikes me I vomit upon your chest
How I wish you would rise
How I wish you'd look into my eyes
But you just lie there
Yet I pretend you're dead
This emptiness
You left me inside
I ain't got no choice
This fragile part of me
That leave me
Without voice
Without voice
I ain't got no choice
You're my heaven
I'm gonna fly on the feathers
O' your golden wings
You're my endless
State o' grace
You're like a nectar
Intoxicates my heart
I'm tryin' to fight
This loneliness
You left me inside
I ain't got no choice
The weakest part of me
That leave me
Without voice
I am cryin'
'cause I have opened my eyes
And saw the whole world
All around
It's all around me
I am suffering
'cause I have opened my eyes
I gotta runaway
From here
From this land of lies
And pain
I know that death is my rebirth
I need dyin' to forget
Every pain and every hurt
I get inside
All I need is to die
I am tryin'
To win this struggle inside
I know that death is
There for me
Please take me with you
I don't belong here
I feel just like a stranger
I guess my place
Is faraway
From this land of lies
And pain
I don't know what's the matter
I don't know what you've done
To me my love
Never felt all this void inside
Never thought I could fall
So down and down
So down and down
You throw me away
Like something that ain't worth
You play with my heart
I don't know what's the matter
All I know I have failed
With you my love
I can't stand your remind inside of me
I can't avoid to fall
So down and down
So down and down
You stare at me
As I wait for you
I need your embrace
I walk through the darkness
Of my life
And that's for you
Don't you try to change me
I wanna live my way
Don't try to help me
I don't need your cures
Don't try to save me
I like to stay on the edge
Of this darken well
Where I'm goin' to fall
Yeas I fall
On and on
Day by day
You know I'm softly fadin'
I need to fall
On and on
Until' I lose my self away
Life's nuthin' for me
And there's nothing I feel
Life's too much for me
Is too hard to live
Life's nothing for me
And I've never asked for this
There's sunthin' wrong inside me
Like someone else within
Just a costant kind of sadness
That doesn't make me live
Such a will of self destruction
That none maybe know
Like the depth of a darken well
Where I'm goin' to fall
Hot sticky scenes you know what I mean
Like a desert sun that burns my skin
I've been waiting for her so long
Open the sky and let her come down
Here comes the rain I love the rain
Here she comes again
Rain
Rain
Rain
One million chances I found tonight
You are there to be my guide
Carryin' me to your absence of light
And I want it
Tell me something new
Tell me something strange
Overall the sense of this pouring rain
All I left behind
All the tears I cried
Fallin' down and down from my bleedin' eyes
You are the other part o' me
Increasin' day by day
You are the contrary of the light
My worst enemy
Give me your soul tonight
And I'm ready for you
Give me your heart tonight
And I accept my destiny for you
I want everything of you
You are the mirror where I'm watching through
Turn my mortal flesh
Into grains of sand
Turn my tearing eyes
In the darkest night
Let me be your slave
Let me fade away
In your open arms
I will find my God
You are the other part o' me
Increasin' day by day
You are the contrary of the light
My worst enemy
Give me your soul tonight
And I'm ready for you
Give me your heart tonight
And I accept my destiny for you
I want everything of you
You are the mirror where I'm watching through
One million chances I found tonight
You are there to be my guide
Carryin' me to your absence of light
And I want it
Give me your soul tonight
And I'm ready for you
Give me your heart tonight
And I accept my destiny for you
I want everything of you
You are the mirror where I'm watching through
Your face your eyes
And all I know of you
Is far away
Your tears your blood
Still flow in me
I can't deny it
This love we shared
This love of us
I can't forget it
I can't do without you
Your name is still the breath of my words
Your taste your scent
Still all around of me
You' re everywhere
Your voice your lies
When you got rid of me
You know it
This love we shared
This love of us
I can't forget it
I can't do without you
Your name is still the breath of my words
Be my arms
My bleeding arms
The satisfaction for you thirst
Be my heart
My broken heart
The way I measure all my love
Be my life
Be my sacrifice
The price I got to pay for you
Consider this empty world
watch it as it falls
Sign it in your head
Sign it in your head
Ear their empty words
The falsity they show
Sign it in your head
Sign it in your head
Don't let 'em tear you down
Get up n' shout it loud
Don't let' em tread on you
Don't let 'em take you for a fool
Consider this empty world
Watch it as it falls
Sign it in your head
Sign it in your head
Ear their empty words
The falsity they show
Sign it in your head
Sign it in your head
You're tryin' on
To save your soul from their lies
You carry on
But they wanna change your mind
You gotta hold on
An' leave this senseless world behind
Your personal style of life
The light you got inside
Don't let 'em take it away
Don't let 'em take it away
They try to mend your head
Makin' you someone else
Don't trust in what they say
Don't trust in what they say
I take a look into your heart
And see the blackness inside
Inside of you
I taste the flavour of your tears
This bitter pain is flowin'
Is flowin out of you
Never see the sun rise
Rising over you
You told me that you' re suffering
Die in me
Never feel you heart beats
Bleeding on and on
Seeking for a reason
Die in me
I take a look into your heart
And see the blackness inside
Inside of you
I taste the flavour of your tears
This bitter pain is flowin'
Is flowin out of you
You will find a shelter
In this killing hands
Settin' free your soul
You will find a saviour
You will die in me
In me
Die in me die in me die in me
Don't you try to change me
I wanna live my way
Don't try to help me
I don't need your cures
Don't try to save me
I like to stay on the edge
Of this darken well
Where I'm goin' to fall
Yeas I fall
On and on
Day by day
You know I'm softly fadin'
I need to fall
On and on
Until' I lose my self away
Life's nothing for me
And there's nothing I feel
Life's too much for me
Is too hard to live
Life's nothing for me
And I've never asked for this
There's nothing wrong inside me

Just a costant kind of sadness
That doesn't make me live
Such a will of self destruction
That none maybe know

Famine infections return of the primate
Homeless females willing prey for his sick trade
They trade their bodies for remains
To satisfy his lust
Abduction without even knowing it
Butchery a normal place at first sight
Once inside a sexual need takes over
Compulsion to rape and come while strangling her
Homeless females willing prey for his sick trade
They trade their bodies for remains
To satisfy his lust
Abduction without even knowing it
Butchery a normal place at first sight
Once inside a killing urge takes over
Compulsion to rape and come while gashing her
The deed ends with a livid face
The job begins the cleaver's fiercely hacking
Chunks of meat
Ripping off her tendons
The bones are scraped clean
Feeding on fools
The hunger grows eating his victim
The job continues the cleaver's fiercely hacking
Chunks of meat
Ripping off her tendons
The bones are scraped clean
Feeding on fools
Homeless females willing prey for his sick trade
They trade their bodies for remains
To satisfy his lust
Once inside he rapes and comes while gashing her
The casualties
Chained up in the cellar
Mother told me not to cry
The foul stench of the cellar
This nation is sanctuary
Paradise for the lowest forms of life
We're deceived by justice
Reaching pussy verdicts
They lock away the bastards
For several years to return
With hate they return
Terror strikes again
Despair and disbelief
Meat for the butcher
Judgement brings hell on earth
Filthy cowards hide in their cells
The new verdict is unhuman death
No more incarceration
Chop them in half hack off their heads
Pulverize their bones
Dispose their bodies in the flames
Embrace damnation
No more incarceration
Chop them in half hack off their heads
Pulverize their bones
Dispose their bodies in the flames
With hate they return
Terror strikes again
Despair and disbelief
Meat for the butcher
Judgement brings hell on earth
Embrace damnation
Embrace damnation
Catenate casualties
Chained up in the cellar
Mother told me not to cry
The foul stench of the cellar
These days are not forgotten
Fact is  I'm now in control
Mom and Dad are gazing casualties
Humanoid
Chained up in the cellar
Decomposing parents
Grinning in the shadow
I wonder if they felt my pain
Outside is waiting fresh meat
Inside is burning blind hate
Where would you rather be
Lured down into the cellar
New blood drips on rusty links
Facing these 2 bodies
Casualties humanoid
Chained up in the cellar
Decomposing parents
Grinning in the shadow
Now my family is complete
Renew my hate looking at you
Outside is waiting fresh meat
Inside is burning blind hate
Where would you rather be
Renew my hate looking at you
Stabbing overdose
Torture myself murdering
Need to kill the urge
Sucked into the abyss
Stabbing overdose
Cannot force out this drug
Evil seed runs through my blood
Stabbing overdose
Torture myself murdering
Need to kill the urge
Sucked into the abyss
Stabbing overdose
Cannot kill the urge
Want for human blood
Pounding inside my skull
I felt reborn when my dagger first pierced
Her chest caved open the ribs torn aside
Made me come
I realized this would become my way of life
Cannot kill the urge
Want for human blood
Pounding inside my skull
I felt reborn when my dagger first pierced
Her chest caved open the ribs torn aside
Made me come
I realized this would become my way of life
My life is deranged
Cannot kill the urge
Need to kill myself
Stabbing overdose
Torture myself murdering
Need to kill the urge
Sucked into the abyss
Stabbing overdose
Aborted slaughter
I escaped the lunacy
Destructive incursion
Ravaged army
Not yet defeated
Hundreds survived
Craving for battle
Onslaught of hate
Skulls implode
Innards flow
Blood erupts
Corpses piled
Graves of blood
Flesh ablaze
Command respect
For the flag of death
Command respect
Terror legion
Aborted slaughter
I escaped the lunacy
Destructive incursion
Ravaged army
Not yet defeated
Hundreds survived
Craving for battle
Onslaught of hate
Under the flag or face damnation
Under the flag or face damnation
Vile amputation
Surgical disaster
Reality macabre
Tools of disease
Sick pleasure
They amputate brutally
Wires are used to saw through the flesh
Splintered bones can be seen
Tearing muscles easily
Slice with infected knives
Make incisions blind
Dehumanize
Victim lies asleep
Awakes in agony
Lunacy
Inbreeding creates those endless fools
To please Christ
Naked cold and mutilated
Pungent is the rectal pain
Open eyes in a pool of blood
You think they're coming for more
Drunk beyond belief
You were raped 5 times
Anal ruptures
Screaming horror
Act like a faggot  feel the consequence
Act like a faggot  feel the consequence
Act like a faggot
Accept your demise
Act like a faggot  feel the consequence
Act like a faggot  feel the consequence
Act like a faggot
You are on your own
Naked cold and mutilated
Pungent is the rectal pain
Open wound in a pool of blood
You see them coming for more
Drunk beyond belief
They will rape 5 times
Anal ruptures
Screaming horror
Act like a faggot  feel the consequence
Act like a faggot  you are the consequence
Orgy in blood
Stabbing the prioress dead
While entering the convent
Nuns cry of pleasure
Vengeance is wreaked
My sexual intent these virgins understand
From women of Christ to the devil's concubines
Their dresses are shredded to pieces
They lie ready to be fucked
Orgy in blood
Breasts all stiff and red
Penetrating where I please
Crawl inside her cunt like a serpent
Constantly using my tongue
In her ass I drown my fist
Orgy in blood
Unholy orgasmic feast
Between her labia
She comes eating another
As my seed gets sucked
Nuns deflowered the virgin blood drips
From women of Christ into the devil's concubines
Their dresses are shredded to pieces
They lie ready to be fucked
Orgy in blood
Breasts all stiff and red
Penetrating where I please
Crawl inside her cunt like a serpent
Constantly using my tongue
In her ass I drown my fist
Orgy in blood
Orgy in blood
Breasts all stiff and red
Penetrating where I please
Starving and shrivelled dying for freedom
They gave you money and shelter
Inviolable stealing us blind
You were raised by our leaders
You gave me shelter now I want more
Give me feed me
Your government proclaims
Welfare estate  demand receive
I am a god
Uncontrolled
Leeches come
They suck the blood out of our bodies
You gave me shelter now I want more
Give me feed me
I am a god
Uncontrolled they live among us
Protected enemies our brooding constraint
It will not be our downfall
Those greedy cunts will never wake
To see a new day
Uncontrolled they live among us
Protected enemies our brooding constraint
It will not be our downfall
Those greedy cunts will never wake
To see a new day
Leeches came
They sucked the blood out of our bodies
Our legion comes
Decapitates the parasites
They gave you shelter we were deprived
You took we claimed
There's no more god
Down here the walls corrode
By the stench of defecation
Children cry endlessly
Held by their dying mothers
The sick are smothered dead and buried naked
Devastating mutilations
War their source of death
On the surface bombs are falling
Shattering all that stands
Fragments piercing bodies
Tearing human limbs
Blasting corpses away
The earth is strewn with the slaughtered
Shelters open their gates
War their source of life
They survive by consuming cadavers
Mangled bodies prepared
Demonic hunger for flesh
Creating their private cannibal warfare
Leftovers of the massacre
Stripped skin bones and intestines
Down here the walls corrode
By the stench of defecation
Children cry endlessly
Held by their dying mothers
The sick are smothered dead and buried naked
Devastating mutilations
War their source of death
They survive by consuming cadavers
On the surface bombs are falling
Shattering all that stands
Fragments piercing bodies
Tearing human limbs
Blasting corpses away
The earth is strewn with the slaughtered
Shelters open their gates
War their source of life
Young child in the church
Infected by the holy word
Superior Christians
Believe or rot in hell
Inbreeding made his choice
His life is scheduled
Blind for hypocrisy
For the beginning of damnation
Mentally mutilated
Young child molestation
Daily Christian practice
Mentally mutilated
Desolate
The twelve year old will confess
The priest he knows it's coming
Welcomes the child
Penetrates its little hole
Mentally mutilated
To please Christ accept my seed make you bleed
Love of god you will receive
Mentally mutilated
To please Christ accept my seed make you bleed
Love of god you will receive
Ignorant child faces years of rape
Inbreeding creates those endless fools
To please Christ
Still is the wind
The leaves wither
Falling from the trees
Reaching the soil
No birds are singing
The awakening is over
I look to the sky
Awaiting the signs
The elders forseen
For battle convene
Live by honour die by honour our call
May I perish carry me to valhall
Endless plains of snow ice and cold
Eternal land no sun at all to warm
All alone lost left to die
Don't know where to go in this frozen hell
Winter wonderland lost in this hell of ice
Icy plains everywhere gone in this frozen hell
Darkness in my eyes
my think about a world of light
Knowing my death will come freezing to death
I heard the voice from the woods
A song of tunes from another world
A melody so seductive
Bewitched I became
Walking in some state of dreams
Towards this vioce enchanted
Deep into the dark forest of doom
The music is greeting me
The shape of beauty standing
In the line of my eyesight
Then she vanish shadows
Raising pulse makes me run
Over sticks and stones I run
In this maze of sighing trees
Just like they have witnessed 
This so many times before
The dark nymph of the forest
Deceiving and fair all at once
Laughing and teasing through the night 
Luring me from my sanity
Now I am lost in this magic dream
The night consumes my mind
All I think of is finding my love
As I fall down to the ground
The Night is here
Silent steps towards my own fate
Hesitation is for the weak of souls
Trembling I grasp my sword
Pulsating blood in my veins
This is the day of days
Can I really succeed
where so many men have failed
But my hate has now ceased
all that my life would have been
Propaganda malicious lies
Escaping from ignorant minds
Jealousy overpowers
As you lose control of yours
Anger and rage boils inside
No control madness expelled
False expressions taking forth
Infect the world with lies
Living in a world full of chaos
Afraid to face humanity
Try to keep the truth suppressed
Drifting towards extinction
Strip you of your soul and your mind
You have no more control
Now the truth has been exposed to
All who believed your false words
Nobody is left to listen
Your words fall on deaf ears
All of your blind followers
Now have opened their eyes
Jealousy within your mind
Contradicting reality
Demented way to live
Failure waste of life
Damage has been done revenge shall be mine
Silenced for eternity the end is now beginning
Propaganda malicious lies
Escaping from ignorant minds
Jealousy overpowers
As you lose control of yours
Your words have stricken me
I am forced to act out my hate
Reached the point of insanity
Revenge has taken its toll
A chronic complaint of dimness
Prevails your profound ideology
A romantic vision of a master race
Attained through coercive forms of authority
Your observance is negligence
If you see the threat from different cultures
We're all in this sinking ship
All of us together
Where does the white man stand
Where does the black man stand
Where do we all fucking stand
KNEE DEEP IN THE SHIT
Look into yourself
And you'll find the real oppressor
To a life of unchallenged hate
It's you who's the nigger
Uuuhhhh  gore hog brings death 
Tusks
Soaked with warm blood
Immense pig of doom
Snout basted with gore
Tusks disembowel
Entrails pulled out
Blood encrusts it's hair
Ribcage lungs intestines fly through the air
The gore hog shall come
To lay waste
it will crush you
Into a pulpy paste
It's jaws smash your head
Scarfing down your brains
Smothering snout in your denise
It defecates on your remains
Uuuhhh  gore hog brings death
Hamhocks from hell
You watch in terror in fear of your life
You cannot conceal this reality from your mind
As unknown powers are unleashed upon mankind
Unleashed upon mankind
Running  in search of safety
No escape  from deadly wrath
Screaming  you beg for mercy
Silenced  by the searing blast
You are forced to believe this is for real
Unleashed upon mankind
Awaiting  with expectation
Impending  life's annihilation
Annihilation
Mass genocide  the resolution
Now verified  out termination
As infesting plagues cause agonies untold
Unleashed upon mankind
Alone you now suffer eagerly waiting to die
Unleashed upon mankind
A god before god
Summon the demons to enter your body
Ceremonies to attain the blessing
A faith in secrecy
No respect for the weak
The victim of hypocrisy
The philosophy chosen to live by
Has brought you your mortality
A reason to die
No remission of sins committed
When you were fighting the lie
Actions begged to be killed
A sacrifice chosen
Laughter at the sight of blood
That has spilled
Respond to the inclination within
A desire fulfilled
Pride for the slaughter is done
While being thrilled
Praise who guards your soul
And for whom you have killed
Fools are the followers of masters they deify
Conversion does not save you from death die
Twisted truth
Twisted truth
A juvenile mind mislead
In the name of your lord you lived
Serving your death
A life full of sin good is evil
Believing the unholy words you read
Commandments are there to break them
Live by your own rules instead
Proclaim the salvation you met
Enter the crypts of hell to impregnate the dead
Fresh burial sight my hunger grows tonight
Undying lust for cadaverous molestation
Sights of death building my sensations
Ferocious need for decomposing bodies
Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldehyde smell of the rot
Suck out the goo feast on her crotch
Raging fires of hell burning through my soul
My love for a dead fuck I cannot control
The child soon will rise all evil will survive
Birth through death
The newborn needs a feast its mother is the meal
Chomping on her flesh his teeth tearing her skin
I love to fuck the dead demons in my head
Tearing at my brain
Bleeding sores beginning to stench
While you lick the festering stump
Green infection discharging pus
Devour the putrid afterbirth
Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldehyde smell of the rot
Sacrifice your life
Young body on altar
You're never gonna die
We're never gonna die
Look at my hands look at my face evil one
And tell me what do you see
Vision of perpetual holocaust
Just what we wanna be
we feel what we want
we feel what we want
we do what we want
we do what we want
we stay as we want
TO BE
ORTHODOX
We're never gonna die
Listen to the persistent beat of your heart
Don't believe the justifiable lies
Who uses to speak to you by two different mouths
So he is dead for us
we feel what we want
we feel what we want
we do what we want
we do what we want
we stay as we want
TO BE
ORTHODOX
You are slowly falling down
Down and down into the deep
You are living from dreams
Dreams and dreams till the end
It is better not to see through the eyes
It is better to be open minded
Everything is so far away
When you want to find that
You are walking down the streets
You are feeling so much blind
Are you stranger in your mind
Are you thinking how to die
Dieby this way of dying
Liquid in your mind
Liquid you can fly
Liquid sweet dreams
Sweet dreamstill the end
You are waiting for help
Help and help from an angel
You are screaming into the night
Night and night this is the danger
It is better not to see through the eyes
It is better to be open minded
Everything is so far away
When you want to find death
Deaththis way of death
Liquid in your mind
Liquid you can fly
Liquid sweet dreams
Sweet dreamstill the end
Evil boys

Screaming something about war
You little stupid nazi
Who never used to think
Why you love to wear the shirt
In color of own shit
SHIT COMES BROWN 
Why do you sit on a toilet
You should sit upside down

As much as you can
Put finger into neck
And vomit out your brains
SHIT COMES BROWN 
Substandard sub nation

Give us power
Crawl for me and don't ask for a key

We don't need you
With red cards and silly arguments
We don't need you
BASTARDS
I see you in my dreams
To hang on trees
Hanged on trees

Everything I can tell
Is here on this paper
Everything I can write
Is here in my mouth
I can't catch the thoughts
Because I lost them in the past
All what I've said before
Is not truth but otherwise
Do I have to fear my life
Or can it to be so much worse
Now I am still living inliving in
in hypnosis
Do I have to fear our mind
Or can it be so much better
Now I am still living in
living in fear
Say everything though my mouth
Say everything though my blood
Think of  everything though my brain
Tell everything though my own god
Tales of your history
You feel so much scarefully
Tales of your history
Or you feel so painfully
You can see the future
You don't know what's going to be
You've seen the past
And there hurts something
You want to clean you life down
But everything stay in your history
Tales of your history
You feel so much scarefully
Tales of your history
Or you feel so painfully
Child is walking down the streets
And looking for the play things
Never to hurry to nowhere
And nothing to know about cares
The rays give him power
To go through evil
And you are telling
you have to be more happy than me
When the sun will lead him
He cannot be scared
Sun cares about his steps
And keeps his eyes open
Mother will die so painfully
As she feels the pain of her child
Any mother wants to see
Death of her child
I've covered soul and mind
I've covered heart and blood
I've hidden the evil one
To see the lie laugh
Body as a cover
You've runyou didn't run
Body as a cover
You've hidden the truth
I stroked velvet palm
To feel the slime of snake
I felt the wind all around
To hear false song
I've seen hate to smile
I've been blind
I've felt break of my heart
I've beencrying
I opened out blind eyes
To wash the truth and feeling
Now there's time for our calm
You can't believe to cover
Body as a cover
You've runyou didn't run
Body as a cover
You've hidden the truth
Body as a cover
You can't believe that
Body as a cover
You have to forget that

The final autumn sun
Drownin in a sea of golden spawns
Once away but oh so near
Gathered gloomy clouds
Passin in the sky as golden swans
The morning dew the fallen leaves
The shorter growin days
All I've seen but never from this side
All my dreams that seemed so real
All they passed on by
Sunken in the last October light
And so I lost it  again but forever new
The lights of spring the gloom of fall
All it has been real
All it's left this mourning deep inside
And once again the leaves will dwell
The swans then will return
But will I ever see the present light
And so I lost it
Long lost and forgotten you are
Covered by the fallen leaves
The only shelter they bring
To forget what I'll never reach
And so I lost it
I'm standing in a cold flood
When I'm going over the lake of tears
A shadow from the Venuspearl
My everywhere blinding and my phantasies
Let red black flames in me dwell
I will join the red honey
On my lips and on my skin and in me
As I saw the waterbride
Arrived at the gate of helplessness
Standing in this bloody earth in hopeless veils
I cry in the winds and remembrance will dwell
As still the wounds are deep
Abandoned and left alone cursed and acrificed
Driven away by her pride I'll wait
Beyond the doors for a light beyond the doors
In a frozen yet lonely time
Your beauty  and my need
Your looks  and my silence
Your image  and my fear
Your looks for one last time
Your image for one last time
Touching your blossoms just one time
Costing your stream just one time talkin to you
The storm of the seasons destructing me
And my leaves fall to the ground
And I revel in my wounds as I feed
My blood mother earth I'll fall to my knees
In the shadows I'll remain unseen
My misery to mother earth and in loneliness
In a world only I live in
where life's no more worth to live
At the gates I cry for you
So I remain unseen in the shadows in fear
The ivy will grow one with my body
It chains me to your bonds the ivy of fear
I hate disgust mankind and I love
To see the light  as the leaves will fall
Another world without harm  as the leaves
Fallen leaves
Endless sorrow is running from out tearful eyes
Flowin down in many rivers
Turning to one in a neverending stream
The time of waiting that has changed us
And will separate us forever
Our crystal dance
We've laughed and we've cried
I was young and didn't know
Our crystal dance
In the summer air we've been enchanted
We walked past the ocean of time
To the ends of this ocean we now have reached
And we cry our endless tears
Our crystal dance
Black crows surround my body
In a bloody occident
Fans surround my spirit
And veils surround the body of my bride
The snow lies cold and the frozen river
Is flowing to the valley of tears
On the bank the bleeding trees
Their blood is spilling away
And a tear is pouring in the stream
Withered flowers covering my bride
My spirit is fallin ill
And our love is runnin over flint fields
The snow whips depression upon the land
Black crows are gathering
Our rhapsody is playin the final song
And the requiem of thy life is coming to an end
I'm standing by thy grave the coffin is lyin
Over the tomb flowing tears fulfill me
You  the rose of my life  you'll fade to black
In a long and cold dark winter night
flowing tears and withered flowers
The coffin is suspended to the tomb
I'm falling to the ground my tears are droppin
Are extinguished as we die as we fade away
Along a dreaming ocean
Coral banks of the eternal desire
Pass away before my eyes
And across I walk so  a romance
The flames of  dream
Cycling dragging the eternal winds
Where some  the worms and sand
The eternal winds gloaming  now
At your feet on carrying sand  color
Along a dreaming ocean
I've been looking for you
To find the island
Your heart is lying on
To find the many 
That I could understand you
The dreams of romance sweetness and desire
A scarlet fire to travel in me
A scarlet's trips a passing my heart
The long hair that lava floods
Dreaming to your pending dress
My  bloody bloody sun
This skin dreaming the color
And so passing myself
And I dream in your arms
And the ocean  someday when
And you're lovely back
 trips
Your hands are combing my hair
When I'm in your arms
I've never understood
Why you doubt trusting my love
And I dream of the red lava floods
At the ocean of the scarlet sun
The beautiful lovely red flames
In your arms
In your arms
In a sorry smile
For all I said
Shall I drown in yours
As once all I had
I want freedom from this cage that contains me
All my hopes and dreams are held within
I seek release from broken dreams
I broke down these walls For me
To set myself free From you
As you bring them back up
All around me
My essence is gone
Im leaving no trace
With your words left behind
Finding my place
A half empty life just falling away
A blind desire waiting to see the light of day
I see a land that is so beautiful
Every branch on every tree is perfection
The portrait of my mind
I broke down these walls For me
To set myself free From you
As you bring them back up
All around me
My essence is gone
Im leaving no trace
With your words left behind
Finding my place
A breathless scream that falters
My arm is held out
But it is all in vain
I broke down these walls For me
To set myself free From you
As you bring them back up
All around me
My essence is gone
Im leaving no trace
With your words left behind
Finding my place
You give me hope
In this harsh world
That the sun will always rise
Your hazel eyes hold me to the ground
I stare into them trying to find the answers
My heart is whole within your hazel eyes
If its the last thing I do
Itll be to prove to you
How much I truly
Love you
I am sorry
That I couldnt be
Everything you wanted
One day your dreams will come true
And this will be a faint memory
You give me hope
In this harsh world
That the sun will always rise
Within your hazel eyes
Within your hazel eyes
Within your hazel eyes
Within your hazel eyes
Within your hazel eyes
Within your hazel eyes
Within your hazel eyes
Within your hazel eyes
The sky is burning
Our world is on fire
All is lost
Witness the implosion from within
I sit here on this aged bench
Watching my everything collapse
Every image in my eyes
I know will be the last
No future just past
Every bit of dirt
Every grain of sand
Forgotten
All the clouds
On this earth
Are lost to the fire
The fire in the sky
In the sky
I stay seated here forever
Acceptance has finally arrived
The world is now a flame
That will never end
No future just past
The sky is burning
Our world is on fire
All is lost
Witness the implosion from within
Theres a monster in the room
Lurking inside of my mind
This is no dream
Not a man made monster
Taking my life
Away from me
Make it stop make it stop
Monster monster
Make it stop make it stop
You have taken so much
How many more things
Can you ruin
But I am to blame
This is my nightmare
This is no dream
Not a man made monster
Taking my life
Away from me
This is no dream
Not a man made monster
Taking my life
Away from me
Make it stop
This is my creation
A weakness from inside
And now it is time
That I face it
Once and for all
This is no dream
Not a man made monster
Taking my life
Away from me
This is no dream
Not a man made monster
Taking my life
Away from me
Make it stop
I stare
At the notches in the wall
Trying to put together the pieces
Predicting the outcome
Before the last piece is placed
Indifference slowly tears me apart 
Bringing all my worst fears back to life 
My world slowly collapses collapses
I beg you for release
The circle of return
That keeps me from escape
I can see it there
No different then before
I know my mistakes 
Cannot be changed
I know my mistakes
Cannot be changed
Indifference slowly tears me apart 
Bringing all my worst fears back to life 
My world slowly collapses collapses
I beg you for release
I am always the same
And always lost
Trapped
Trapped
Trapped
In the confines of my mind
A mistake made time and time again
It is always the same
I am trapped inside
The confines
Trapped inside
Trapped the confines
Trapped of my mindPriests and their clergy 
Royalty unbound 
Pastors and prophets 
Religion unfound 
False implications 
Of terror on the rise 
Fleeting beliefs and 
Impossible highs 
Reason holding holes 
Endless punching deep 
Rotting out our bones 
Killing all that need 
Endless attachment 
Understanding Scars 
Losing your faith and 
Poisoning Altars 
All this religion 
Promises in place 
None understanding 
Disgrace with grace 
Reason holding holes 
Endless punching deep 
Rotting out our bones 
Killing all that need
Fire like stars
Illuminate
Wisdom leads shadows escape
The clearing at the end
Ferocious me
Consuming Everything
Understand days
To medicate
A time to live a time to hate
Assuming everything
We will survive the night and
Well never admit defeat
Transgress and leave behind all
Forgotten enemies
Ill feel the cold
Burning as of late
We transform we subdue
Contemplate escape
I'll see that you complete 
Your suffering 
Walk alone into night 
Truth you'll find 
Secrets lie in this hell 
Stories they tell 
Answers lie on the other side 
Tonight we ride 
Our Path is set our fires burn bright 
As we head into the night 
You feel the power raging through your veins 
Follow us into the flames 
Were reborn unto night 
Outside of time 
Nothing left only death 
WE NEVER REST 
As we watch the blood flow free 
We satisfy our needs 
Answers lie on the other side 
Tonight we ride
Wasted life form 
Twisted master 
Appropriately 
Over under 
Shining brightly 
Inside open 
A finding so sweet 
A journey under 
As we wake up 
Darkness waning 
This understanding 
Undertaking 
Nothing left now 
But an open sore 
Show us the future 
Show us the score 
I won't rest until you're gone 
Understanding that you've won 
Another time for anyone 
One last sigh 
Wasted life form 
Twisted Master 
A finding so sweet 
A journey under 
Nothing left now 
But an open sore 
Show us the future 
Show us the score 
I wont rest until you're gone 
Understanding that you've won 
Another time for anyone 
One last sigh 
Feels like we fanned this flame forever 
And damned these rains since they begun 
But now the waters taking over 
Dousing the fire that never burns 
And now the sky itself is falling 
It can no longer hold the sun 
Without the light we were creating 
Our future life may never come 
I wont rest until you're gone 
Understanding that you've won 
Another time for anyone 
One last sigh 
One last push into the sun 
Shining bright for everyone 
Another night another dawn 
One last high
We're faced with graves and names
Those we've loved and those we've shamed
We'll live and so we'll die
A place to be so
Brave
I'll see light follow
Alone and low down
Every night
Martyrs burn with their red eyes
Our Lives have been so blind
We love and so we hate
Our lies will be so
Brave
I'll see light follow
Alone and low down
Every night
We'll live in another place
And in another time
A place without regret
We can be so
I'll calm down
As we lie
And I'll lie
as we lie
And I'll take
My last breath
And I'll stop
When I'm dead
Inside this lair built of hate
The sickness overtakes
Another step ahead
And one behind
Past scars open up
As blood begins to flow
The sores infected
And will never heal
Forever sores and sun
We gather to become
Another burn so near
Nothing changes over here
Blood trickles under
The softest embrace
We hope for rendezvous
One last destructive move
The blood will subside soon
Lust found and love subdued
Blood trickles under
The softest embrace
You understand me like no one I know
Please be behind me Ill let no one know
Light dims in overview
Torment was all I knew
Extinguish all I feel
Until I cannot heal
Blood trickles under
The softest embrace
You understand me like no one I know
Please be behind me Ill let no one know
Im your forever behind you Ill prove
Once and forever the world will undo
Another answered call
A wound befit for all
An anger runs so deep
For all that you shall reap
Blood trickles under
The softest embrace
You understand me like no one I know
Please be behind me Ill let no one know
Im your forever behind you Ill prove
Once and forever the world will undo
Disease to cause unease
Is what we follow blindly
Obscure spells and cures
For all and everybody
The damned are conjuring
You shape forever wanting
Perfect and oh so sane
So vain and never taunting
Worship an unseen force
No hope for understanding
Your faith is always worthless
Always too demanding
Darkness Remains Complete
In sight of day sinking
A willing hand pushing
Darkness obtains fucking
We will keep this right here
One more time out for fear
Ill watch and youll forget
Once more and thats this shit
We age
We subside
We rage
We cant hide
Darkness contains your luck
Forever under struck
A shock an outside wish
An under over stitch
You grasp for precious air
All wounds become so clear
You scream and fall apart
And lose all your support
We Live
We release
We learn
To never see
I didn't see it coming
As it creaped nearby
It burns
Destruction in it's wake
Ashes by ashes
It will all fall apart
Screams in the night
No mercy to be found
Agony rises
Dismay and fright
Hope is fading
No sign of daylight
Apathy fills the room
Discourage takes control
Taking what is left
No more strength to find
You will find no cure for this
Ashes by ashes
It will all fall apart
Screams in the night
No mercy to be found
Agony rises
Dismay and fright
Hope is fading
No sign of daylight
I wish I could find a ship and just sail on by
Let the wind guide me all the way
Watch all the birds leave and follow them
In search for warmer land
The rebirth of time
Will leave no man behind
The rebirth of time
Will conclude the faith of all mankind
Relieve us of our torment
Kunstig fremtidsoptimisme
og falsk glede
Harde kÃÂÃÂ¥r og fremtidens vrede
HÃÂÃÂ¥pet svinner bedrÃÂÃÂ¸vede sinn
Bringer morgendagen glede
led den inn
Livet vi levde svinner hen
Gleder vi deler blir fÃÂÃÂ¦rre
Livet rakner
Ting mÃÂÃÂ¥ snu
Livet rakner
Vi ledes mot dypet
Tiden gÃÂÃÂ¥r mennesker forgÃÂÃÂ¥r
Brorskap gÃÂÃÂ¥r til grunne
familier splittes
Jammer gir gjenklang i byer
Disharmoni er
Livet vi levde svinner hen
Rettferdighet mÃÂÃÂ¥ vike for urett
Moral kveles av egoisme
Empati er satt til side
Likegyldighet lever
Slit og besvÃÂÃÂ¦r preget vÃÂÃÂ¥r hverdag
I ly av avmakt
sakte vÃÂÃÂ¥r dag forgikk
Mennesker graver sin egen grav
Livet vi levde svinner hen
Rettferdighet mÃÂÃÂ¥ vike for urett
Livet vÃÂÃÂ¥rt rakner
vi ledes mot dypet
Sakte vi graver vÃÂÃÂ¥r egen grav
Livet vÃÂÃÂ¥rt rakner
vi ledes mot dypet
Sakte vi graver vÃÂÃÂ¥r egen grav
Europa brenner
I saw a future standing
before my weary eyes
A reformation of life
grasp or decay
Frightened by light
this opportunity escaped
Lonely and cold
hiding from daylight
These burdensome longings
tearing me apart
I hold my breath
to stay alive
I'm lost in confusion
stranded on air
I remain in despair
Waiting in silence
hiding the pain
I enter nightfall
never left any trace
Only memories of what
could have been remain
In my secret plight
These burdensome longings
tearing me apart
Through the sorrows of
my life I slowly realize
My longing my desperation
can not be cured
Before the pain in my heart
has been tread apart
These burdensome longings
tearing me apart
No one ever saw me gleam
Jeg rir i nattens mÃÂÃÂ¥neskinn
for dette er min skjebne
En hvilelÃÂÃÂ¸s som lever kun
om nettene alene
Med min sjel knust til grus
holdes jeg i skyggen
av hender fra et liv engang
Som nÃÂÃÂ¥ har vendt meg ryggen
Jeg hater og beundrer de som
gjennom sÃÂÃÂ¸vn kan rÃÂÃÂ¸mme
inn i fantasien De som tar for
gitt ÃÂÃÂ¥ drÃÂÃÂ¸mme
Stillheten er voldsom
En skrikende sirene
som hÃÂÃÂ¥nlig henger over meg
Den vet jeg er alene
Den kjenner min historie
og leser fra mitt minne
fra bildene jeg aldri maktet
ÃÂÃÂ¥ fÃÂÃÂ¥ til ÃÂÃÂ¥ forsvinne
Den vet mitt skrik er sjanselÃÂÃÂ¸st
Det overdÃÂÃÂ¸ves fort
Her skal stillhet hÃÂÃÂ¸res
Her svinner lyder bort
Hypnofobi MÃÂÃÂ¸rke og natt
Kakofoni Ensom forlatt
Jeg ler i nattens mÃÂÃÂ¥neskinn
hvor tiden aldri gÃÂÃÂ¥r
Forsonet med en skjebne som
jeg tror jeg nÃÂÃÂ¥ forstÃÂÃÂ¥r
Jeg fremfÃÂÃÂ¸rer et skuespill
Verden er min scene
En enmannsforestilling
We have a noble cause we all fight for
Three hundred gliders and our paratroops drop in
September seventeenth let this battle begin
We are battle hardened at Market Garden
Up from the Ardennes Market Garden
We are battle hardened at Market Garden
Up from the Ardennes Market Garden
Now in our second day the twilight zone
No thoughts of family no thoughts of home
I am tired hungry and our stocks are running low
We have a job to do but we are all alone
Maybe a week has passed we are but a few
The time has faded fast the lives have too
I hear them coming and I fear I cannot move
I have been thinking deep within my head
Time for blinking is time to end up dead
The mass passed on through the mist
A procession of dark coats
Held high the crucifix
The darkness grew formless
With secret mysteries
The vast night revealed it's face
Over the long dead trees
The darkness thrived relentless
The black mass they were all nameless
They spoke the words of elder kings
In the darkness
At the hill
In shapes of demons
With urge to kill
Dark bells were tolling
The conjunction had begun
The procession moved on slowly
Into the beyond
The darkness thrived relentless
The black mass they were all nameless
Ancient demons unfold their wings
Still the rain kept falling
The mass passed on through the mist
A procession of dark coats
Held high the crucifix
Silent is the graveyard
So is the temple of god
Thirteen women gathered
In sisterhood of blood
Build now a circle of fire
And drink from your cups
Hail high the baphomet
They discard their clothes
And naked they dance
With ancient spirits
In unearthly trance
Build now a circle of fire
And drink from your cups
It's the witches sabbath
It's the witches sabbath
It's the witches sabbath
It's the witches sabbath
The forces thrive
With fire in their eyes
Evoken firegods of ancient sinister might
Unseal the gateways
To the womb of the night
It's the witches sabbath
It's the witches sabbath
It's the witches sabbath
It's the witches sabbath
Followers heading against
The fog over the cemetary
Drifting through the silent night
And from the light of their candles
Dark shadows arise
Cemetary
The kathedral
Six disciples guiding the shadows
With the magical hand of doom
And with the claws of darkness
Spirits are torn from the graves
Cemetary
The kathedral
The candle
Burning curse
Now the candle must burn
And the dead will return
The unholy gathering
Under the ancient night sky
Cemetary
The kathedral
The candles
Burning curse
I set the candles alight
For I have chosen the night
The powers of the unknown
That sparks and shines
All emotions set free
The shadows can see
The forces of darkness
Dwells in me
Meditation Nightsky Above and below
Oh can't you see
The creatures of the unknown speaks to me
Oh can't you fell
The unknown the red eyes and the beast
I touch the formless night
As it devours all light
It sweaps across the darkness
With blazing might
The astral plane
It's powers shall reign
As the forces of darkness
Is unchained
I see faces
Forming in the night
They give me knowledge
They take me to hell
Beyond
In the dark halls of my temple
Where the white cross stands tall
The seventh ghost have entered
Awaiting my call
Spirits of the unknown
Dancing with the flames
Passing through the black halls
Playing wicked games
There is a spirit
I can feel it's presence here
Dancing round the graves
Feasting upon fear
I wake up the dead
The evil eye in his spell
Watching my every step
His very name I can not tell
Spawned in the mouth of hell
With the backbone of the night
The seventh ghost stood tall
The devourer of light
And the white cross fall
I wake up the dead
I play in their heads
I wake up the dead
Tonight their not dead
I wake up the ghost
At the center of the graveyard
In the middle of the night
A woman dressed in white
Is closing up in sight
Demon eyes and sharpened nails
Speeding through the night
With deadlike eyes
And the speed of light
Nothing but death can stop them tonight
In vicious delight
Nothing but blood can still their thirst
Killing in the night
Twisted beauty without face
Through the ancient maze
I could see her face
Beyond the human race
In the sign of the pentagram
Now the lot was cast
I could see my past
In damnation vast
With fire and death in eyes
See strikes out high
Into the dark and flickering sky
Sha has all forces
That hides in the night
Devours the bringer
of eternal light
Dark souls are breathing within these halls
Black arts and sorcery
Shadows reflecting upon the walls
Evoken from infinity
Thunder your hoves and join uor rites
The ceremony has begun
The sorcerer unlocks the pentagram
And all worlds bleed into me
Across the path of doom
Into the temple of old
The shrines of the unknown
Black magick
Dark forces
Across the path of doom
Into the temple of old
The shrines of the unknown
Black magick
Dark forces
As I stared into the darkness
Red eyes stared back on me
Burning circles through fumes and fire
Mystic symbols and ancient runes
Risen high through the fog
A statue green from age
Spirits howling incantation
All Hail Satan
Your envoy is at hand
The monolith
Eyes red as fire
A body build of souls
Of those who seek him
At the edge of time and space
Descent to meet my fate
I saw the faces of thousand demons
As I passed on through the gate
Risen high through the fog
A statue green from age
Spirits howling incantation
All Hail Satan
Your envoy is at hand
The monolith
Eyes red as fire
A body build of souls
Surrounded by living self indulging mirrors
digesting temptation's stolen fruit
moving on selffulfilled circles
personality hanged on a rope called capitalism
organism breathing a life of false ecstasy
You shall die so many times before you perish
consuming the fruits of ill virtue
lusting society's forbidden fruit
loving in uncaring detachment
creativity sacrificed to a world of conventions
hedonism existing in a maelstorm of lies
A dream become a creed a want become a need
a serenade for the tragic
a lover self confessed a circle truly blessed
emotional hegemony
Sanity on a shoestring a tripwire tragedy
oscillation between extremes
of agonizing sumblimity and sublime agony
Skirting reality with holistic perceptions
absorbtion of truths
wanted as evidence and evidently unwanted
gladly court oblivion
by loving with death and dying to love
Desires pursued to their bloody ends
and compulsive denial
I'm seeing the parts in me
that which I hate to see
suffer the shadows
suffer the shadows
The child inside weep for my life
for such bitter twisted dreams
the fool by her side could never see lies
any economy of truth he believed
Blind to compassion
I shall suffer the shadows in my past
depressed and saddened
I shall pay my debt to nature
The mother insode feels my sadness and pain
in this growing pool of desire
the father by her side could never have cared
cold blooded he lived as a liar
Severed from unearthly mythomania
I lay to rest te ghosts of past seductions
leaving false paradises unfathered
I sing swan songs for stability
the way of all flesh of all flesh
Desiring life from my emotional mortality
I lick the wounds of sexual openings
becoming spiritual and libidinal
I breathe life into this union taking flesh
At one with the clean breasts of sensory delight
I endear myself to this mutual growth
leaving feelings of restraint unmothered
I plunge into metasensivity
Pistols at dawn for my pseudo sanity
I filt unfettered through an erotic fantasy
becoming luminous and emotive
I understand all seven heavens
Utterance of a word to give form
to give being all
corrupted by aeons of interpretation
misinterpretation of all
No longer a path back to that which once was
now a suicidal game of chinese whispers of god
The word mutated a phrase of fallacy
the phrase a law that rules our lives insanity
Assimilate myriad delusions
seek the whispered word
behind the roars of ingorance
Seek the path back to that which once was
no more futile fumblings for a misunderstood god
He that lives in hope dances to all ill tune
for wantonness knows no law
nor souls to be damned
and work incentives
In the world of the blind
the one eyed man makes corporations
corporations leaving sickness
which can't be cured which must be endured
One funeral brings many in civilised society
a society soon ripe soon rotten
A guilty conscience needs no accuser
nor breathe for us again
and momentary lapses of reason
Internal descent down every ladder in existence
to give myself vision where I was blind
I trip the trigger and detonate my mind
Fragmented memories and kaleidoscopic visions
reality is mutable and open to revision
seek the supersonic become one with all
immerse myself in the ocean of my soul
Gather the shattered remains of thoughts
thought mattered
redefine my world
liberates any soul
Lost in myself alone I stand
searching for a death of moments
divine and mundane reconciled I live
The world realigns and begins to take form
breathless and weak yet alive reborn
experiment or experience Rejoice or regret
Only one way to know as I take my first steps
Picture a man with his life in his hands
consumed by the death of his dreams
clutching at straws he dreams no more
a desolate figure I am he
my agony fuelled by the shadows I ruled
I hide from the world in the dark
outwardly sane I conceal my pain
life's touch cold steel in my heart
Wanting fearing facing life alone
I'm not hearing your reasons so leave me alone
I'm on the brink of insanity I think
consumed by flames of desire
the twofaced divinity a victim of tragedy
the flames now its funeral pyre
but the death still walks and the divinity talks
I'm facing it day by day
each glimse a hell I've come to know so well
see the idealist pay
narcotic escape before it's too latedeception
I've invested my soul in achieving this goal
made pacts sworn oaths taken vows
I never realized each pact has two sides
what hope for my soul now
we're both still here one light one dark
though the cyclone now lies dead
so let's both dream of things we won't see
I can feel it in my heart
Believing in myself helped me through
The hardest part of time
We've resurrected once again
United united we'll win
Take it back taking back our scene
Old style we'll tear you apart
A new day has arisen a moment in time
That will not be forgot
This is the time the time is now
So tear it apart once again 
spreading all your worthless threats
just a bunch of fucking lies
you're just a fucking cop no better than me
you're my fucking enemy
blow off your fucking head  a kick to the face
blow off your fucking head  a kick to the face
Delightfully supreme the Neptune water rains
Am I the chosen redeemer
On planets unknown to any kind of race
But slumbered since the creation of time
Awakened now blossomed up as divine grace
This graceredder than the wine of damnation
As the ultimate silence reached the dim woods
When suddenly I realized the spirit I searched
So I spoke the words with an impetuous tongue
Have
Eternity
Because in fact I am a sylph
Lost in a sullen slumber
Until the end of time
I am your bringer of death sacrifice to me
I am your bringer of death sacrifice to me
So get on your knees and worship me
Get on your knees and show worship
Get on your knees and show
You Slut
Come on kill meShall you Return
to the 7th  Throne of the Kings

Fiery tormented years

The untimely Entropy of All
The fall of contradiction

Scars of the Unexpected
Beauty of ultimate Absolutism

The bounds that now expire
Minimizing non  existence
Expansion of the infinite
A Gift of Grandeur
Relic of the Blade

A shower of Scorn
The Wind of Aeternity

We swear to the Waters of Styx

Splashes true in the Veins

Still and pure a one way call
Magnetic whirl that draws
An edge in firm rotation
The purpose that bound
of ecstatic outbreak

Clearly the end
I know
Which card will be drawn next 
I know my time has come
To take my place
Among the circle of shadows
of shadows
The memories of pain
You caused with malice
Are but faint echoes
Now growing distant
Your pins and your flames
Cannot hold me any longer
Right
My revenge is certain
The cauldron awaits
for you  as well
My spirit will endure the end
My hate will be the guide
Endlessly roaming the blind Abyss
So you now see
My friend
Even Hell has its martyrs
Spirit will endure the end
Hate will be my only guide
Spirit will endure the end
My hate will be the guide
Staring from the blue cold stiffness
The visitors are here
They draw near like the flashing
Of a pallid memory
That cannot be disposed of
The blood that has painted your hands
Guilt the Erynies
They move closer
And surround
Where are They now
Where are the visitors now
The blue and white of death
The blood now black
Ever  flowing from slit throats
The never  blinking
Frozen eyes
They appear
circle's closing in
to remind 
force the nature
of the Ugly
to float again in the surface
The Essence of Guilt
Comes to life
My victims are aware 
I cannot hide
Did you see Them
What have you seen
Please understand this
There is no true option
As I draw the razor
The Visitors are here
Enter Princess of Lust
The Lady Dressed in Red
A mantle in desire
Of carnal subconsciousness
These arrows
Are merciless
For pleasure and pain
Stunned by Your charms
Men abandon their efforts
Cast off their armor
Lower their weapons
And ready
their chests to take the blows
Gremory
One Glance to conceptualize
The Evil Inside
Capturedby alook so strict
Feel my muscles stiff
A naked child before Thee
Sister Daughter
Lover Mother
Wife of all to be
Of all the females
I will only Love Thee
To Gremory
We are dragged by Your Net
Reach out for Your touch
Grasping from Your cloak
And Spin at Your Whim 
Countless forms for Countless Names
Each one for each of our minds
Your gifts are longed Queen of the Succubi
Trembling Ecstasy I' m begging on my knees
For one last caress only one more
To satisfy my burning blood
Glorious Vanity 
To wed the mirror image
of the opposite sex
You found within me
Wife of all to be
Of all the females 
I will only Love Thee
To Gremory
Wife of all to be
Of all the females 
I will only Love Thee
To Gremory
This is the Black Maze I have Entered
Where the numbness of Souls 
Exists in Eternal Dark
Here I lay floating
Blind and Powerless in the Night
Truly I' m Slain
And Dreaming of Life
My Spiritual Existence caught in a Web 
I lie waiting
but the Flame of my Soul
hasn't faded Yet
Then a Voice summons
The Ship of Time is here
I'm drawn back to the plane of material
Then again I rise Regenerated
Under the sign of the Baphomet
The darkest hour of Walpurgis Night
My spiritual body 
Stronger than could be
Pure lightning flashing
through my empty sockets
I am the Swordwraith 
Oh thee of the White Christ
Beware for I seek Revenge
Your champions are no match for me
Your priests now tell you lies
Your weak faith makes me laugh
And smile as you realize
The fate your god arranged for you
Your hope abandons you 
your courage drifts away
your weapons cannot Harm me anymore
your eyes in Fear
cannot challenge my Gaze
Now I Kill and destroy
The sword's Howling in Madness
Ripping Flesh
and Souls Apart
Blood is everywhere
As I devour your Essence
And become Immortal
A true dark Angel  
by Draining you to the Abyss
I Am the Swordwraith
Mortal worms
And watch me Burn the cross
Before your dying eyes
You are the Gleaming King
In the starry plains
Of the Twilight Sky
Who stands Among
Spirits of Darkness
Your Throne made of Stone
Your Scepter made of Gold  
Take us to Your World Horned One
Take us to a World 
That'll Never reach an End
Hark
Satan you defeated Jahova the priest
In a world that stands amazed
Before the Miracles of Nature
Satana  Exegersi
Eosfore  Empnefsi
I'll drink to the great day
That we will watch
The eternal church of Jesus Crumbling Oh
Take us to Your World Crowned One
A world that'll Never reach an End
To the Ethereal with You
You our LordShall you Return

I am the Swordwraith 
Oh thee of the White Christ
Beware for I seek Revenge
Your champions are no match for me
Your priests now tell you lies
Your weak faith makes me laugh
And smile as you realize
The fate your god arranged for you
Your hope abandons you 
your courage drifts away
your weapons cannot Harm me anymore
your eyes in Fear
cannot challenge my Gaze
Now I Kill and destroy
The sword's Howling in Madness
Ripping Flesh
and Souls Apart
Blood is everywhere
As I devour your Essence
And become Immortal
A true dark Angel  
by Draining you to the Abyss
I Am the Swordwraith
Mortal worms
And watch me Burn the cross
Before your dying eyes
You are the Gleaming King
In the starry plains
Of the Twilight Sky
Who stands Among
Spirits of Darkness
Your Throne made of Stone
Your Scepter made of Gold  
Take us to Your World Horned One
Take us to a World 
That'll Never reach an End
Hark
Satan you defeated Jahova the priest
In a world that stands amazed
Before the Miracles of Nature
Satana  Exegersi
Eosfore  Empnefsi
I'll drink to the great day
That we will watch
The eternal church of Jesus Crumbling Oh
Take us to Your World Crowned One
A world that'll Never reach an End
To the Ethereal with You
You our Lord
Witness to the mysteries of old times
resurrect lost ways anew
set my eyes high upon crimson skies
and burn my way right through
descendants of the dark age
a repressive reign of blame time
and again vile shepherds
revel in their lambs shame
Sinister shades of destiny
symbolic principles of the divine
bitter dogs of Christ
civilization's ultimate decline
Reason outweighed by the cross
infested theatre of redemption
whilst the buried don't lie
swarm the lords of aberration
cleansing storms broken bones
a spiritual crown of thorns
Invoke me under my stars
Love is the law love under will
Nor let the fools mistake love
for there are love and love
There is the dove
and there is the serpent
Malarky of a kingdom above all
the omnipotent and his bastard son enthroned
weeping saviour
selfproclaimed ruler to a land beyond
Burden of the flesh and grieving soul
a dormant contestant to the throne
seek beyond the bloodstained stone
Wandering restless through the ages
cast aside for standing proud
contesting the powers that be
and holding strong your ground
born at dawn of time
denounce mortal sin and shine bright
spread your wings and lead the way
grand embodiment of light
Witnessing the imminent fall of mankind
enslavement of the blind at heart and mind
awaiting to break dawn the Morning Star
bringer of hope for night and day to realign
Oh Eosphoros
Burn my eyes out
so that I could see real light
Eosphoros
Not one to turn the other cheek
nor one to turn a blind eye
not one to walk among the Earth's slime
flame of passion burning close to heart
crucify all doubt to rise above the divine
give thanks not unto God
for he is unworthy of Thy praise
Wars to be lead and fights to be won
derelict monarch to be overthrown
not one to sacrifice himself
nor one to make a covenant
a pact with the Devil
signed with Thy own blood
Disavowal the longstanding epitaph to reason
fearing not to stare beyond the seventh sea
restless mind unbound crumbling the divine
holding dear that which God failed to foresee
Lift the curse of blood imprinted stigma
shed Thy light upon the darkest side of man
awaken the bereft of self with Thy splendor
put an end to mortal prophet's reign
Guided by Darkness
You may close your eyes
yet see what others cannot see
scream of vengeance paint the skies with blood
let angels tremble with fear
let them feel your wrath
hold high the torch of Prometheus' dream
and keep that flame alive
Bleed the eyes of the unworthy
drive Thy wrath through their hearts
feed their remnants to the wolves
and put an end to holy rites
Hear O heavens Listen O earth
For the Lord has spoken
I reared children and brought them up
but they have rebelled against me
Their worm will not die
nor will their fire be quenched
and they will be loathsome to all mankind
Verses inverted to please and suit
an obscure masquerade of life
collapse of all reason
lambs of God depraved lobotomized
merge night and day
purge holy scriptures
with Thy ancient flame
terminate the insolent
feast victorious
reestablish Thy domain
Scriptures of a somber lord
a testament to Babylon's whore
celebrating winds of plague
filthencrusted desolate souls
untimely demise of the mourning soul
deprived of worldly desires
restraint blindfolded and gagged
This is where it ends all fear and all doubt
This is where it ends all fear and all doubt
This is where it ends our fear ends now
We lost our way 
eyes loaded with all we tried to save 
when did it go wrong
I can't live holding a clock in my hands 
We lost our way 
holding back the truth we tried to say 
when feelings held us down
Open describing something broken
Patience a path too far to reach
Who will stand against them 
Who will help me fight them 
Who will be the voice to break the soul
Who will be the first to throw this brick
Who will stand against them
Who will help me fight
Because we believed every lie 
Restless a constant work in progress
Shameless is bearing all you have
Willing to accept the fact we're dying
A promise that you'll never be alone
Because we believed every lie 
Expose us for the dreamers that we are
Expose us for the failures that we've been 
It's come to thisit's come to this
Free me from this hell
I don't wanna stay here I'm ready to leave 
I really hate to ask this I'm ready to go
Just close your eyes and squeezedo this for me
Your song is what's making this oh so hard
Free me from this hell
I don't wanna stay here I'm ready to leave 
I really hate to ask this I'm ready to go
Just close your eyes and squeezedo this for me
Say goodbye to the hero say hello to the martyr
Free me from this hell
I don't wanna stay here I'm ready to leave 
I really hate to ask this I'm ready to go
Just close your eyes and squeezedo this for me
There's more to life than this
There's more to life than this
There's more to life than this
There's more to life than seeking their approval
There's more to life than this
Free me from this hell
I don't wanna stay here I'm ready to leave 
I really hate to ask this I'm ready to go
Just close your eyes and squeeze
Free me from this hell
I don't wanna stay here I'm ready to leave 
I really hate to ask this I'm ready to go
Just close your eyes and squeezedo this for me
do this for me
You just stood there
Straight out of a dream drenched in kerosene
All I'll ever need is in your eyes
Give me a smile test my commitment
Embrace me forever because we fit perfect
All this for love you don't you don't understand
All this for you I tried hard to let go
All this for love you don't you don't understand
All because I don't know how to say goodbye
Emerging from the flames smoke still in my lungs
No remorse at all for anything I've done
Go down in flames
All this for love you don't you don't understand
All this for you I tried hard to let go
All this for love you don't you don't understand
All because I don't know how to love you
All this for love
All this for love
All because I don't know how to say goodbye
Under a reddened sky in the darkest of places 
Both standing tall with smiles on our faces
All you ever wanted was to never be alone
All I ever wanted was to watch this city burn
All this for love you don't you don't understand
All this for you I tried hard to let go
All this for love you don't you don't understand
All because I don't know how to love you
All this for love
All this for love
All because I don't know how to say goodbye
All this for love
All because I don't know how to say goodbye
We can feel the strength rising to the surface
Only looking back to see how far we've come
We recall the moment
When courage refused to sit in silence
And we found a strength that we had all along
The black clouds that surround me
No longer hold the weight or strength to bind me
Because I'm standing right outside this castle
That now lays broken in her ruble
Screaming out a name
That brings me pain 
We're on our own but not alone
Death is a lie that threatens my everything
My choice is clear so I'm not afraid to scream
I found love I fell in love
Look in my eyes tell me you feel the same
My choice is clear so I welcome the pain because
I found loveI fell in love
One by one we float rising to the surface
Showing our heart showing sacrifice
And we found a strength that we had all along
I can't shake the images I get
From stand up on the cliff
Because all it took was a couple matches
And a passion fueled by hatred
To redirect the pain
To start this flame
I fell in love 
Our heart is what guides us
Our dreams keep us pressing on
We've come too far to turn back now
Lights out over Portland
My life changed the day she came in
Lights out over Washington
A beauty that I can't wait to see again
Lights out under a dead moon
I know it's dark the light will come soon
Lights out and though I'm gone
I'll be back for a name that beats in my chest
My chest is weighing me down
And I'm so scared of leaving
My heart knows what it wants
Want to or notthis is my home
Lights out from the front line
I was brave but so scared to die
Lights out for the last time
We found something here that they'll never find
Lights out to keep you safe
Her embrace leaves me homesick
Lights out and though I'm gone
I'll be back for a name that beats in my chest
My chestis weighing me down 
Please don't forget me
Keep my memories
I know where my heart is
I'll be back I promise
Just take a breath
The skin breaks but just won't stay broken
Capitalizing on their mistakes
They gave you everything to take them down
They're gonna get it now
You'll send em straight to hell
For everything they put you through
Your heart is filled with sorrow
So poisonous and so hard to swallow
They're gonna get it
now
They can't hurt you
So why are you so afraid
Are you ready to make them pay
The ones you trusted set you up to burn
So why are you so afraid
Are you ready to make them pay
Scared of what you'll find
Ashamed of who you were
You're not that person anymore
You're not the person that you were
Take what they did and rip them to pieces
They'll never cross you again 
Fists up all eyes focus on one
When these babies drop its gonna block the sun
They didn't feel then they're gonna feel it now
Heads up look 'em straight in the eyes
They escaped before but not this time
The skin breaks but won't stay broken
I'm giving up on finding love
At least until the smoke and dust clears so I
Can finally see for once true love
I'm breaking every rule that I made
Just to push you away
I won't stop trying to find you
I'll spend my whole life here searching
But when the heart talks
You better listen updon't ever fall in love
It's been so long since I've been gone
This constant distance is what tore us apart
I couldn't live inside your phone
I won't down play this choice I've made
And I won't deny that this is my life 
I'm breaking every rule that I've made
Sorry to push you away
From this day forward I move on
Pushing myself far beyond all limitations
And every distraction placed by you
Because I remember what you said
And how I foolishly believed in every lie unseen
But it doesn't matter now that me is dead
Done doubting myself those days are over
I'm not afraid of failing you like I was before
Because in the end it's in my hands
To be the things I want so bad
My fear ends right now
My fear ends now that me is dead
I'm breaking every wall I see
As well as every heart I get
It's not poetic
Nor am I sympathetic to your screams
Don't talk to me about fair
Don't try to play me like you cared
You only loved one thing
And that one thing wasn't me so I moved on
No longer afraid and no longer oppressed
Free to follow my dreams
On to glory on to death
Both fine by me 
My fear ends now
With arms stretched out
I embrace the choice and made
And let nothing stand in my way 
Pictures armed with fake smiles
Remind me of a time when I was lost
Broken and felt totally enslaved This is my life
A life I hated falling victim to routine
I've always known that wasn't for me
Don't say don't say that this is how
A perfect life should be
It's not perfect to me
You try you try to justify
The deadliest of lies so I'm bringing it down
I'm bringing you down
Your plans are flawed 
This is my life on my terms 
My dreams mean everything to me we said goodbye
My dreams mean everything to me to our old life
Another day like the same old days
From my window I watch the crowd
Walking machines with their distant eyes
Hypnotized they're not really there
With their thoughts they can't see around
Hearts of stone trapped in their minds
Future worrying
A past left behind
Unknown present
And life goes passing by
Stone land
We've been living in a Stone land
But there's another chance
It's time for us to build this world again
People living with big city's lies
Empty bodies filled with loneliness
And their souls lost in the sands of time
Future worrying
A past left behind
Unknown present
And life goes passing by
Stone land
Let's break the chains
It's our time it's our chance
Let's all join our hands
And change this world into a promised land
Closed within my thoughts
Thinking about my life
I can't fall asleep
In the still of this night
People around me
Stare at the frozen sky
And a cold wind blows
Blinding all my sight
Am I alive
Can I survive
Out there the snow falls
Killing all kinds of life
No trees no sea and no sun
The world is painted in white
Take me away
I wanna see a burning sky
Save me from this nuclear winter
Show me some kind of light
From inside this shelter
I see a deadly black bird
Crying an old sad song
To a land once called earth
I'm cold and weak
My mind is such a torment
I'm lost and confused
I'm dying at each moment
Am I alive
Can I survive
Dreams that once I had
A little boy's fantasy
Now they're all gone
That's the end for me
In a distant Galaxy
In a small planet lives this race
Slaves of their minds lost in fear
By the power of time they're fading away
They don't know they're part of God
Their bodies holy temples
They're always called back home
But can't hear the eternal song
Father sun warm them up
They take comfort of mom nature
But like bad seeds they don't grow up
To their world one day they shall return
And there big masters live
In different times different lands
Revealing them great mysteries
But just a few could understand
You're really big
Big as the universe
You've gotta learn the way back home
There's something for you
You're not alone
For the stars you're the only one
Lost in illusions they are
Their eyes can see no more
Throwing their forces away
Waiting for another day
You're really big
Big as the universe
You've gotta learn the way back home
Open your eyes
This is the time
To find out the secrets of life
When I look at those shining stars
I still remember of my childhood time
For years I've been waiting for you
Why can't you hear me I just need a sign
I wish that together we could fly
And soon find our lost green sky
When the sun used to shine
And green was all in sight
We started killing the tress
And the air we breathed
Future was so clear to see
But nobody wanted to believe
Mother nature gave us what we needed
And we sold her love for an ambitious dream
Let us fly through the stars
Looking for green skies
Flying high a new life we'll find
You and me wild and free
In perfect harmony
With peace we'll live eternally
Spread your wings on me then we can fly away
I'm waiting here for you someday
I turned my face looking for a sign
But I saw good men being killed for their minds
So simple and true they were fighting for life
Let's get together
We're all very strong
Just like music
Like some chords
In a song
No more we'll stay alone
United we'll be one
There he was standing all alone in the night
An old man preaching some words of love
Some words of life
There will be there a brand new day
Listen to what I have to say
Everybody
That sound was coming right through my ears
Deep in my soul touching my heart
Drying my tears
You gotta learn first for then to teach
So listen to this forgotten preach
And he was saying
When going through bad times
And you can't see a light
You can't wait for a helping hand
Cause they don't give a damn
It's a jungle we're living a survival game
It's up to you
To make your dream come true
We we have to fight for our dreams
And build a world we believe in
To win the hardest game
Be yourself and just try to do the best you can
Maybe we'd believe in fate
But it's never too late
We must try to change it and pave our own way
Searching for our wasted years
We've found joy we've found tears
We'll keep fighting till our dreams become real
It's up to you
To make our dreams come true
You've expected too much from this world
Come on stand up and fight for your dreams
A description unfitting resonate and predigested
A transaction of extraction transference is here
Stir the pot to see what you've got to appear 
Psychic vampire paranoia down the wire
Psychic vampire goodbye
Psychic vampire paranoia down the wire
Psychic vampire goodbye
When you're dealing with those devils 
To who or what you gonna pray
Time of trials is unleashed artifice is overcome
When you're dealing with those devils
To who or what you gonna pray
Don't you want to know the sign
Don't you want to know your time
Long of tooth the shadows grow
By the stream where nothing flows
Born in the land of confidence dying of disease
Paralyzed standing tall but rotting at the knees
The leeches are speechless
The leeches are speechless
We look to the sky consume be silent die
Won't ask no questions why
Consume be silent 
The leeches are speechless
Suck the blood of freedom
Because there's more than meets the eye
Seen the light to weak to fight
For smoke and mirror lies
The leeches are speechless
We look to the sky consume be silent die
Ask no questions why consume be silent
Sacrifices must be made to the gods of war again
Who brought this world of sorrow
Who stole your tomorrow
Who brought this world of sorrow
Who stole your tomorrow
Who brought this world of sorrow
Who stole your tomorrow
With pride their shallow ride vanity's believing
Riding high but my soul is all tore down
Gathering momentum into the ground
These words are tainted disinfotainment
What I see is acid to all logic but it's alright
This light is darkness but it's alright
Overlord needs no sword
The brow that beats the sheep don't speak
But it's alright
The wool is on the whites of their eyes
The viral clone of virtue
The shadow caste is getting longer
Believe you're blessed when you say yes
Then you know the trap is set
That's right the moneychangers
The moneychangers ah ah ah
Now in the matrix take your place
They'll tap your labor and your light
Gain euphoria from your paranoia
That's right the moneychangers
The moneychangers ah ah ah
Believe you're blessed when you say yes
Then you know the trap is set
Feed the fire the rite of fuel
Conspire
The end begins the mute they die
Kill the fly kill the fly
Bow down or walk away
Walk away
Surreal babylon is here to stay
In retreat we plan attack so sweet
Our plans complete
Celebrate this power
Light the owl the time is now
The time is now
Bow down or walk away
Surreal babylon is here to stay
Greed came to flower
And nourish power
Bow down or walk away
Weaving spiders come not here
Come not here
What you despise is what you've become 
How low can you go
The hospital
Am I out of my head
Where is the backbone you used to own
Did you sell it to the corporate head
Sunken so low for the gold
Another sell out now
Another sell out cause you're out of my head
And what you despise is what you become
Why am I surprised that you're the one
Cause you're a company man
How low will go
To go for the gold
Twoface Mr company man 
Slip and slide and compromise
Sinking into the house of quicksand
So close your eyes and live a lie
Cause you're done you're done
You took the money and run
You took the money and run
You took the money now you're out of my head
What you despise is what you become
Living the lie you took the money and run
Cause you're a company man
And what you despise is what you become
You took the money and run
You took the money now you're out of my head 
And what you despise is what you become
Living the lie you took the money and run
And what you despise is what you become
What you despise is what you become
Rat city
You can't outbleed me you'll never outbleed me
Rat city
Win by numbers survival by cunning
Rat city
Keep your friends near your enemies closer
Rat city
I've come to make my way
Try to grow the family
In a parallel realm
That's here but unseen
I might penetrate your grain
Might be in your labs of pain
Forever together
We are one until we're done
Visualize the demise of a self inflicted prison
History doesn't have to win
Just because the words been written
Reverse the curse of endless thirst
Chapter to verse the stake is driven
Saturated memory the recognition worn
Been a steep and winding path
From another epoch born
Reverse the curse of endless thirst
Chapter to verse the stake is driven
To derail the time machine
And to let the future speak
In a time of trials
Dystopia may thrive 
Let delusion slowly melt away
Fall away
What new light brings this unraveling
It's snowing outside the rumbling sound
of engines roar in the night
The mission is near the confident men
are waiting to drop from the sky
The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly
No one should go where eagles dare
Bavarian alps that lay all around
they seem to stare from below
The enemy lines a long time passed
are lying deep in the snow
Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare
They're closing in the fortress is near
it's standing high in the sky
The cable car's the only way in
it's really impossible to climb
They make their way but maybe too late
They've got to try to save the day
The panicking cries the roaring of guns
are echoing all around the valley
The mission complete they make to escape
away from the Eagles Nest
They dared to go where no one would try
they chose to fly where eagles dare
O God of Earth and Altar
Bow down and hear our cry
Our earthly rulers falter
Our people drift and die
The walls of gold entomb us
The swords of scorn divide
Take not thy thunder from us
Take away our pride
Just a babe in a black abyss
No reason for a place like this
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain
An easy way for the blind to go
A clever path for the fools who know
The light of the Blind  you'll see
The venom tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are opening  you'll see
She came to me with a serpent's kiss
As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry
So we lay in a black embrace
And the Seed is sown in a holy place
And I watched and I waited for the Dawn
The light of the Blind  you'll see
The venom that tears my spine
The Eyes of the Nile are opening  you'll see
Go
Bind all of us together
Ablaze with Hope and Free
No storm or heavy weather
Will rock the boat you'll see
The time has come to close your eyes
And still the wind and rain
For the one who will be King
Is the Watcher in the Ring
It is You
It is You
As the sun breaks above the ground
An old man stands on the hill
As the ground warms to the first rays of light
A birdsong shatters the still
His eyes are ablaze
See the madman in his gaze
Fly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way like an eagle
Fly and touch the sun
Now the crowd breaks and a young boy appears
Looks the old man in the eye
As he spreads his wings and shouts at the crowd
In the name of God my father I fly
His eyes seem so glazed
As he flies on the wings of a dream
Now he knows his father betrayed
Now his wings turn to ashes to ashes his grave
Fly on your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way like an eagle
Fly as high as the sun
On your way like an eagle
Fly touch the sun
On your way like an eagle
Fly
Fly as high as the sun
Another Prophet of Disaster
Who says the ship is lost
Another Prophet of Disaster
Leaving you to count the cost
Taunting us with Visions
Afflicting us with fear
Predicting War for millions
In the hope that one appears
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
'Cos if you're gonna die if you're gonna die
'Cos if you're gonna die if you're gonna die
If you're gonna die if you're gonna die
If you're gonna die  if you're gonna die
If you're gonna die die with your boots on
If you're gonna try well stick around
Gonna cry just move along
If you're gonna die you're gonna die
13 the Beast is Rising
The Frenchman did surmise
Through earthquakes and starvation
The Warlord will arise
Terror Death Destruction
Pour from the Eastern sands
But the truth of all predictions
Is always in your hands
You're gonna die die with your boots on
If you're gonna try well stick around
Gonna cry just move along
If you're gonna die you're gonna die
They die with their boots on
Yes they die
The day they die with their boots on
The day we die we die we die we die we die
No point asking when it is
No point asking who's to go
No point asking what's the game
No point asking who's to blame
'Cos if you're gonna die if you're gonna die
'Cos if you're gonna die if you're gonna die
If you're gonna die if you're gonna die
If you're gonna die  if you're gonna die
If you're gonna die die with your boots on
If you're gonna try well stick around
Gonna cry just move along
If you're gonna die you're gonna die
Die
You'll take my life but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand there's no turning back
The Bugle sounds and the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
As I plunge on into certain death
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
We get so close near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds take my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan
Take a look in the pool and what do you see
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see
They were there oh I know you don't believe me
OhI've never felt so strange
ButI'm not going insane
I've no doubt that you think I'm off of my head
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool
Something draws me there I don't know what to do
Ohthey drain my strength away
Ohthey're asking me to stay
Nightmaresspirits calling me
Nightmaresthey won't leave me be
All my life's blood is slowly draining away
And I feel that I'm weaker every day
Somehow I know I haven't long to go
Joining them at the bottom of the pool
NowI feel they are so near
Ibegin to see them clear
Nightmarescoming all the time
NightmaresWill give me peace of mind
Now it's clear and I know what I have to do
I must take you down there to look at them too
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool
Can't you see not just me they want you too
Ohwe'll drown together
Itwill be forever
Nightmaresforever calling me
NightmaresNow we rest in peace
In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth
When the land was swamp and caves were home
In an age when prize possession was fire
To search for landscapes men would roam
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire
And the wolves they howled into the night
As they fought a vicious angry battle
to save the power of warmth and light
Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched all through the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man
And they thought that when the embers died away
That the flame of life had burnt and died
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire
Were made by rubbing stick and stone
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts
In the search to find another fire
To regain the power of life and heat
Drawn by Quest for fire
They searched across the land
Drawn by Quest for fire
Discovery of man
Well you killed your first man at 13
Killer instinct Animal supreme
By 16 you had learned to fight
The way of the warrior you took it as your right
Sunlight falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel
Through earth and water fire and wind
You came at last  nothing was the end
Make a cut by fire and stones
Take you and your blade and break you both
in two  break you both in two
Sunlight falling on your steel
Death in life is your ideal
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on
He is the King of all the land
In the Kingdom of the sands
Of a time tomorrow
He rules the sand worms and the Fremen
In the land amongst the stars
Of an age tomorrow
He is destined to be a King
He rules over everything
On the land called planet Dune
Bodywater is your life
And without in you would die
On the desert the planet Dune
Without a stillsuit you would fry
On the sands so hot and dry
In a world called Arrakis
It is a land that's rich in spice
The sandriders and the 'mice'
That they call the 'Muad' Dib'
He is the Kwizatz Haderach
He is born of Caladan
And will take the Gom Jabbar
He has the power to foresee
Or to look into the past
He is the ruler of the stars
The time will come for him
to lay claim his crown
And then the foe yes
they'll be cut down
You'll see he'll be the
best that there's been
Messiah supreme
true leader of men
And when the time
for judgement's at hand
Don't fret he's strong
and he'll make a stand
Against evil the fire
that spreads through the land
He has the power
to make it all endRestless and full of hell
You've received the sun
Where the holy mother machine
Caresses you incestuously
Sucking her cancerous breast
You drank the life of others
That you called dreams
Among plastic messiahs
Behind fake true love
Between masters with feet of clay
Beneath this hunger you've got
Cross now your grey empire
On your desolated chariot
With the armour of gods
To protect your insignificance
Hypnotic lucidity
Freezes the blood on your wires
To learn the electric movements
Of the sacred heartengine
Betraying and leaving
Those nailed children of thought
By this selfcatalepsy
Their wings flesh and bones
Became your throne
But there's a difference you don't know
Between dusk and dawn
Because plastic messiahs
Or fake true loves
Or masters with feet of clay
Can't calm this hunger you've got
La primavera ya no es concreta ÃÂ¿huirÃÂÃÂ¡s
La rosa cerril camino a Niebla bailarÃÂÃÂ¡
Hoy es el dÃÂÃÂ­a en que nada comenzÃÂÃÂ³
La Risa negra quema la ceguera solar
RÃÂÃÂ­en los circos de la inmensidad
Hoy somos bestias que untan hostias en el mal
En tres infiernos todo esto se va a derrochar
Pero siempre algo extraviaras
El fuego negro quema la ofuscaciÃÂÃÂ³n solar
Llegan los circos de la inmensidad
Troubler la fÃÂÃÂ¨te
VacÃÂÃÂ­o sol de fiestas te llenarÃÂÃÂ¡s
pero la carne profunda se abraza lejana
When partner wine tastes like acid vinegar
Outside father sun is laughing he can not see me
I hear his voice but I can not feel his heat
A cold broken tank the soul spills slowly
I'm awaiting the void naked and numb
Dark mother loneliness embraces her dying child
Scorned at birth he was conceived to die
He can see nothing back into a deadly womb
Because all I had I gave I gave to the winds
I trusted they deceived stole me
Now I'm one of the doomed poorest beings
We all live at the Nihil together but alone
Resigned to know I cannot die again
I have no chance just living here
Walking barefoot through these arcane lands
While you beg for the carnal ghost penetration
Nihil
It seems I destroy what I have what I've created
It has never been perfect and never will be
Disdainful death I come to demand you
I want it now I wish for it now
Indeed
I am king sadiM blessed by infection
While you turn your beauty to grimness
I cum on your immaculate white skin
As you lose your faith violently
I have failed again
It seems I soil all I touch all I've loved
Clero Inmundo de CanÃÂÃÂ­bales
Lleno de Putas y Bastardos
Desdibujado en Aguas Profundas
Con PoesÃÂÃÂ­a de Barcos Naufragados
Musa Incomprendida
Tu MenstruaciÃÂÃÂ³n Esmeralda
Me llega en tibios Oleajes
Inspiradora y destructiva
Abuso AbsoluciÃÂÃÂ³n Ausencia Absinthe
Maldigo vuestra farsa
Mientras la audiencia despierta y aplaude
Sin comprender
Mi gesto idioma
Eternidad momentÃÂÃÂ¡nea
Vomitiva no conoces mi nombre
Yo soy sangre piedra y fuego
 Mi raza extinta mora en el silencio
ÃÂ¡Absinthe
Vagabundo inquilino de la nada
Viajo junto a las quimeras salvajes
Y en las noches alimento las hogueras
Con cercos hechos de clavos y espinas
AprendÃÂÃÂ­ de sabios fÃÂÃÂ³siles
Que la arena fue montaÃÂÃÂ±a
Mientras cruzamos pantanos
Y escupimos tumbas vacÃÂÃÂ­as
 Acercarse es alejarse
 Acercarse es alejarse
Could you cook my pride
Please season it with rage
Then let me feed off it
I will become your slave
An ancient formula used
To dominate nihilist dogs
To break their strongest fangs
And then leave them dying
Power of defeat
Makes you wake up
But only like a half
51% dead
Half zombie half man
Stench begins to grow
As the deepest feelings
Turn to the coldest lust
Parents love their sons
The father brings food for all
Sick creatures parasites and the great whore
Happy life goes on
Far away we waste our feelings
Blind for a lifetime
To kill us far away from the light my partners
Almost Dead my friends
Through torture could we find our freedom
Tenderness / Defecation
Sweetness / Masturbation
I had been taught to speak
The language of butterflies
I have been used to think
That we all could have wings
Who said we could not have wings
So give me the illusion
Then give me frustration give me
Promised light
For all of us denied
Mocks at this grey little being
Promised light
The prize for all those blind
Tamed souls who still believe
When disappointment kills hope
And hunger makes us forget
Forget that once we wanted to be free
Now the fountain of wishes
Belongs to me just to steal the coins and run
Run away
The flowing of a thousand
Dead forgotten dreams
Caged into the sleepy trance
Of the trip back home
Where am I
Am I here today
Yesterday
Or ten years ago
That's how I'm still piercing the guts
The deep and complex anatomy
Of the huge grey beast
We are all slaves of
 Would we melt through friction
 No my wordless stone is always one
 So may I laugh at your grey solitude
You will never sing those songs
ÃÂ´Cause you can not bleed my stone
Those will never drink my nights
Stone and Magma
Performance without passion
Drowned in Magma I breath
Watch me being reborn
Watch me as I fuck
Watch me as I cum
Watch me as I die
We Say He is a mute man bound by his walls
A dreadful gut that eats silence
He is the eternities of life
A painting without impressions
A rare life that shines black
She is the killer of this death
She is the devil's social bones
She is the breast which can dissolve
Life and its twisted games
A torment that makes me sleep
The dissolved stone speaks in flames
Now I breathe and laugh her fires
and all my words are too late
One hundred ninety worn out
They cannot be again
Cannot repeat
She was only her
He was only him
Never again
There is a dangerous humanity
Which can kill me or the ones I love
We are the murderer
We are the undertaker
We are the mourner
The earth is dangerous
Can I trust in you
Can you trust in me
Can I trust in me
Stone gods
Now can I trust in you
Kerran vain haaveeni nÃÂÃÂ¤hdÃÂÃÂ¤ sain
En pienuutta alla tÃÂÃÂ¤htien tuntenut
Kerran sain kehtooni kalterit
Vankina sieltÃÂÃÂ¤ kirjettÃÂÃÂ¤ kirjoitan

Symphony Of Destruction
You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a God
Watch peoples heads
A'roll
A'roll
A'roll
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction
Acting like a robot
It's metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head
Explodes
Explodes
Explodes
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction
The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Stands tall
Stands tall
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Just like Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the Symphony
Swaying to the Symphony
Of Destruction
PerkeleSo father if I wake up hard to conceal
What I need I take off what I want I steal
Bring me directly taste the poison
Memories reappear from the lightning sun
Been a thief of liars true to what is real
Eternity ain't over until I can't make a sound
Earth angel rising swallow in the sun
I promise it ain't over run life into the ground
You'll see me around I'll see you around
I take a chance by letting you in
I take a chance at getting poisoned again
I take a chance
I get stabbed in the back again
I wanna see that I want to stay
Don't wanna make the same mistake
Too much at stake heroic dose I take
Bombs go off around me
Bullets chase my head
Demonscene hellscape
Try to not get dead
From the cradle I was in
Straight for the firing line
By the teeth of my skin
Dragon and the serpent versus swine
Never quite ready
It just becomes your turn
Evertight steady
No more light to burn
A lie has no feet
Cannot stand alone
A cry in the street
Who cast the first stone
With dirt between my teeth
I made the devil sell his soul
I know that he can bleed
Moon goes dark sun grows cold
Where my mind would take me
Never coming near
Scared my heart would break me
Why am I here
As the crow flies I will make my way
As the day dies I look back and say
I look back and say well spent time today
I make my own way and I am not afraid
Beautiful in life unforgettable in death
Don't stop dreaming until the last breath
Until the last breath the hunger to be
Break of dawn I raise my head
Another night is gone another day is lead
Need you to embrace me hear my call
Rain twists shapes and hisses fear
I kiss my tears as the ground disappears
White stones fall down from the sky
Rats in rhythm and snakes in tongues
Mud flakes and fungus are coating my lungs
Squash the doubt mankind washed out
Screaming pleas as mother earth breathes
Throw away the trees blow away the breeze
Sea to rising sea grey solar light
Wicked winds churning up the polar night
All living things under leaves gasp
End of the whirl
Trend of the system
Bend of the curl
Hell will never miss them
Brains us to think
In tiny trains of thought
Time and time again
Mind overwrought
Above all the people
Above all the creeps
Above all the steeples
Above all the freaks
Weigh in weigh out
Time fleeting by
Day in day out
Life spilling by
Follow the same
Unwanted blind
Swallow your name
Get left behind
Above all the people
Above all the creeps
Above all the steeples
Above all the freaks
You're freaking out 
Seven billion breathe all at once
Heaven well conceived experience
Breed ignorants feed ignorance
A simple meaning
To a simple plan
The temple gleaming
Keep fooling man
The question won
And beat the answer
Riddle come undone
Fat lady dances
Above all the people
Above all the creeps
Above all the steeples
Above all the freaks
Above all the freaks
Above all the freaks
Above all the freaks
Above all the people
Above all the people
Above all the people
Above all the people
C'mon people
Pick up the pieces that the puzzle made
From scraps of dreams out of focus and frayed
Make up the reasons for the words that were said
From scraps of dreams that trap the screams
Take my place leading the pack
Back down from my razorback
I dig deeper to bury and find the track
I am the king
I am the king
I am the king of the underdogs
You know that's my name
King of the underdogs
King of the underdogs
Running into the unknown
Lonely yet I am not alone
I keep looking to grind a stone
I am the king  underdogs rise
I am the king  from the flames
I am the king  underdogs rise
I am the king of the underdogs
You know that's my name
Underdogs rise
I am the king  from the flames
I am the king  underdogs rise
I am the king of the underdogs
You know that's my name
King of the underdogs
King of the underdogs
Sworn to fun discovery
I still dream imagining
Beyond the edge recovering
Underdogs rise from the flame
Feel the sound feet to ground
Hellhound unchained
And they rise from the flame
Feel the sound feet to ground
Hellhound unchained
Underdogs rise
Underdogs rise
Unleash the hellhound
I am the king king of the underdogs 
I do not need a torch anymore to see
Satan on his porch this ain't for the weak
While in my place I lay dreaming
Fight for the space on the terra dwell
I'm keeping to my heaven under your hell
Without the underworld there would be no above
Without the otherworld there would be no above
Without the underworld there would be no above
Without the underworld there would be no above
This is for my friend no longer here
Pick up signal in the atmosphere
Look away look above stargazerÃÂ 
From where you're sent to me unclearÃÂ 
A comet with a twisted tailÃÂ 
From on high resounding wail
Logical master constant truthÃÂ 
Cosmic master slight of hoof
Look away look above stargazerÃÂ 
From where you're sent to me unclearÃÂ 
Books of plays discover amazerÃÂ 
Your vision lives eternal here
Turn up guitar begin to play and I cheerÃÂ 
Sounds so much better when we're up here
With your hands you shine back lightÃÂ 
I see you in the stars at night
D'amour in my heart to stay
Up until my last dayÃÂ 
Too soon my friend taken away
Adieu my friend taken away
Please don't take my friend away
Revolution
Welcome to my revolution we bleed to believe
The music keeps me young and lets me see beyond
Rise up we are fine light 'em up now
Get high rise up we're fine now light 'em up
Begin the day dive in the waves
Smile in the sun swim with the rays
Laugh in the light loud is the sound
Live in the night cannot bring me down
Ancients walk on the land rising out of the sea
Into the blue bright yellow spies
Surroundings new under see life
Flash the horizon lightning strikes leap
Passionate rising fighting to keep
Ancients walk on the land rising out of the sea
Ancients walk on the land rising out of the sea
Above the ground nightmares exist
An absolute catastrophe
Our fear our weakness shining through
We did it to ourselves
Writings no one will read
Sounds no one will hear
Open the door and shield your eyes
Witness the horror you've always denied
A holocaust beyond the walls
But within our hearts dreams still exist
A fight for humanity
This is the way legends are made
Against all odds we'll live again
This is the end a time to begin
Plant the seeds they'll grow in time
We'll live again
The eyes surrounding
The pressure is mounting
Billions of fingers pointing the blame
Your words are whispered
Your smirks like pistols
Loaded and ready to fire
All alone I'm helpless so helpless
But all together we can do this
For each other for ourselves
Heart is all it takes
Trapped in every direction
As darkness encircles
But I know there's a light
I could feel it inside
Heart is all it takes
Sometimes you have to
Burn your bridges
And never look back
Cut the ones who never gave back
Bite your tongue
Til it bleeds and writhes
Just to keep this enmity inside
I stop these tears
And hold my head up high
I face my fears
And keep hope alive
A test in solitude
Your face only makes it burn
Feet planted firmly
Fists clenched tightly
Dyslexic messages
Read between the lines
Just let it go let it die
My silence holds strength
When worlds cannot explain
Distance makes the heart grow fonder
Who said that anyway
Must've been someone just like me
A hopeless design under constant repair
All the wiring tangled disconnected
Burnt wires short circuits
Dip me in water destroy my insides
It'd feel a lot better than this
Being alone desolation at its finest hour
Being torn away from you the essence of torture
What if a devastating thought
Why is eating at my heart
God where are you when I need you
I'm stuck I'm so fucking lost
Those things most important to me
You shouldn't be one of them
But you are I can't help it
These scars I can't stop them
Your words they latch onto me
Never weakening only weakening me
I have so much to say but no time to say it
I've said too much sew my mouth shut
So lost without you
I keep falling
Falling apart
Falling for you
Falling deeper
I reach up for you
You're still so far away
Please clutch my hand
And don't let go
Don't let go
Somewhere in my head
Weakness makes me invincible
This place does not exist
Nowhere can I be myself
If only I'd enjoy the suffering
Welcome to reality
A place where weakness is destroyed
Watch it spiral down
Into the darkest hole
I close my eyes
And hope to hit the floor
Watch me spiral down
Repeating all my woes
Hear my failing words
They echo
If I could crush my skull
If I could examine my thoughts
What the fuck would I see
It's all so different
Life has been raped
Love has been executed
Excreted through bowels of infestation
I always knew love smelled like shit
This force is pulling me away closer to the dark
Eclipse the light
Now I feel the presence the power the darkness
It lives inside
You're not immaculate just a misconception
Impregnated with animosity
You tremble at the thought
A story in your tears
This means so much more
Textbooks cannot explain
The tragic history of man
The innocents the bloodshed
Don't pray for him
False sermons for the frail
Pray for a change
Pray it's almost over
Familiar faces overhead
Memories fall from sullen eyes
Fallen soldier hear these words
In your honor we unite
Fallen friend hear my cries
In your name we'll continue to fight
This is all too real all too familiar
What this generation needs now is a revolution
We'll fight not in the name of a threeway lie
But in the name of our brothers
Our sisters our mothers and our fathers
With death comes life
This place of plastic
Where the fakes are so real
This toxic wasteland
Where the real is unreal
The dirt poverty and loneliness
Where the movies come true
Thinly shrouded by the extravagance
Of the privileged few haughty elitists
We'll never be like them
We'll simply rise against
We're the struggling masses
Where we come from is how we will live
Beauty in chaos not the Hollywood bullshit
Where we come from is how we survive
It's in our blood don't you ever forget it
A concrete jungle where we rest our heads
In the midst of the madness
This is where we live
And this is where we'll die
Our birthplace our burial site
This is where we'll die
I had a dream last night
You were standing at my door
Welcome home lifeless shadow
To give is to receive
But you've given me nothing
Not even tragedy
Could open my sleeping eyes
The sight of empty space
The fear you'll never return
You'll never return
My greatest fear has come true
Forced to breathe without you
This waking nightmare is realized
Breathing without you
The final chapter a revelation
I will breathe without you
Awaken
When sleep comes forget it all
Sleep should be like death
Eyes wide open I've awoken
I will breathe
A cough so dry it tears flesh away
Brittle nails I'm biting again
Scratch and burn old and used
But ready to make anew
Ready for what's coming next
I wouldn't have it any other way
The storm is coming
Dark clouds above
Engulf me engulf us all
Our throats are dry renew us
Give us life give us strength
Mother nature the almighty let it rain
Give us life give us strength so let it rain
Drown our corpses
Wash us away sweep us into the gutters
Rebirth of I a path not made for the weak
But that worth living for
Worth dying for stays the same
Always my home so let it rain
Constant change forever in motion
This time IÃÂ´m falling down
Senseless shadows
I canÃÂ´t find you alive
This time your soul
Couldn't touch my sin
And everything inside my mind flowing behind
I have that sense every time of loneliness
The empty souls of empty skies
Hell in heaven the bloody inside
Everything belongs to something or to each other
I`m sick of empty hopes
and drifting from one to another side
Shaking tears of shaking souls
how far the rain can fall when I'm bleeding
how much the wind can take from me
Ash to ashes and dust to dusts
White to black and days to night
Am I just the lonely one on this side
Life is the empty wave of distress
Welcome to my kingdom
you are the hopeless soul
you are the helpless soul
Now hopes are lost which we dreamed about
They are sacrificed for us waiting in the coffin
My lying body is crawling in pain
breathing the last moment and decay
Day after day fall on my skin
Stay on my side deep inside
Ouu my nymph close my eyes
Touch on wings under sweet lies
Can you hear the begging of sorrows
They come for the spirits of loss
Trying to be one of billion
To listen to the raven like the swansong
at days I am lost in the sunshine
at nights I find myself in the endless cries
How can I hover with you like winds 
How can I leave behind us all sins 
where can I revive my withered hopes
Trying to be one of billion
Stay alive in destroying storms
To listen to the raven like the swansong
To look at the dark like it has been sun
and to feel like you were with me
Every little hope inside
surrounded by dust no one can see
A secret garden in the funeral
and the soil calls for our dead love
roots of the crying flowers
Dried leaves of the trees
poured over the grief
souls of the hidden truth
uprise and scream
In silence no one can hear
A sapling appears on the ground
Shining dark and lonely
Embraces my rotten hopes
they are still black forgotten lost and hopeless
Blowing mountains
took my serenity
and whispered me above
The mist of desperation
Dripping down my skin
The final word is said and done
The story ends where it began
You have to face the emptiness
There is no way to talk it out
Senseless bodies
lying under barren soils
the roaming is aimless
The doors are closed and locked
The air is full with blood
You have to face the loneliness
There is no way to hide out
Empty souls
lying under vapid graves
screams are meaningless
IÃÂ´m not saying goodbye
Even if they burn me
IÃÂ´m not saying goodbye
Even if they whelm me
IÃÂ´m not from them
You can not help me
They will never make me fall
Loneliness and painful screams on empty streets
Whom you thought were your friends
And they have taken all my remembrance pale face
And they have taken all my remembrance
And they have taken all my dreams
there is only wind wind plays the game
They left just flesh they feed grievous sorrows
I hope that all these waves of distress
will break my loneliness Just for a moment
I will take my deepest breath
They feed with our grievous griefs
Whom you thought were your friends
Like leaf that is winnowed by autumn wind
Can you hear me
Sometimes I think what if I am forgotten by you
Too many bravemen came
They came to search for wealth and lies
But all that they found was disgrace
Even the strongest fight and fall
Before the powers of death
And if you hear this just try
Dont wast your life in vain
Maybe you dont believe my friend
Maybe youll never understand
If you go downdown by this river
The place of dying men
If you hear this sound
Maybe youll never fall
Listen to my prayers
Coming from the ground
Killing all around
The place of dying men
By passing this tale were trying to release
The soul of the brave men from dark
Even the strongest fought and fell
Before the powers of death
Those from above are caring for us
Praying for triumph and glory
And now this tale is finally over
The curse of the dead will go on
Dark factories lie ahead of us
A dark sun burns
These false prophets never
Told us what it has
Behind this
A dreadful symphony
Behind this
A hollow tree of seed
Behind this
Denying all we need
Behind this
Despiteful world we live
How could it be our tomorrow
If there arent any shelters
How could they lie to me
And if you say you know how
To live without sorrow
Then you are lying to me
There is no more time for me
Many things I saw
Many things I live
Thats my doomsday
There is no more time for them
Many things they know
Many truths they sold
Thats their doomsday
Foul words spreaded around us
A red star burns
Their false propaganda
Always lives
Inside your minds
Dont think just believe
Inside your minds
All truth you need well give
Inside your minds
A lovely life to live
Inside your minds
Inside your minds if we needyoull start to kill
A dreadful light above us
A red sun burnt
Their lies never meant any threats
To take the world
Flying to the encounter
Tell me what you feel
Certain death is coming
The end is near
Natural born hunters
Stalking at their prey
Fighting for the freedom
We have no fear
We gonna fly we gonna live
We gonna fight we gonna win
We gonna fightWe gonna live
We gonna win we will carry on
Raining fireX8
Far from home
The globe in blood
Their brave deeds
Will not fade away
Looking to the counter
Tell me what you see
Guns sound like thinder
The end is nearwe have no fear
Fighting for the skies
Killing machines
Undefeated fighters
They have no fear the end is near
They had fought together
Their Great history untold
Fear
Here
For one more day I stayed alive
Trying to find another way
A path to sanity
Like a shot from a gun I feel
Conformation leads to ecstasy
I couldnt find another way
A run for guns agreed
Living in this world of fear
Release me for Gods sake
Now your time to die has come
Out of control
Beyond this point I go alone
Taking their lives
I dont even cared about you
Im out of control
Out of control
I will get you now my friend
Dont try to escape from me
Im the first rebellious
Like a saint in hell you said
Resurrection leads to ecstasy
Never found another way
A run for guns agreed
Ruling in this world of evil
Trusted by God I still believe
In the will of Heaven
Here comes the fear of been caught
They come to me after midnight hour
What is the truth behind
that ancient nightmare
They have sadness in their eyes
and shadow deep in their souls
They come from everywhere
And everywhere is dark
The loneliness of existence
destroyed all my dreams
I went beyond in the land
of ancient nightmare
trying to stay alive
The dark path
Their search for paradise
lead them to dark
eternal pain
Walking trough a valley of shadows
Waking up screams of fight
To contemplate a life of sins
Staying outta light
From darkness theyre waiting Im not alone
Their voices echoing before the light
Eternal sorrow
Waking to sleep
and take my walk slow
Thinking about my fate I cannot fear
I learn by going where I have to go
Were gonna play God forever
When were gonna learn
To live our lives without regrets
And always be the same
On the threads of fate wise men walk
From the threads of fate dead men come
Wicked voice
The chain of life has come to end
Dissoluting void
What came to be a human
Look inside yourself
Evil Voices
Bloodfeed me now
Your life belongs to me
Youll never rest in peace
No I have no tears to cry
when I close my eyes
The shadows tell me to do what they want
have no choice
Im condemned by the night
I feel like burning in hell
far away from light
The shadows tell me to do what they want
have no choice
Im condemned by the night
Wicked voice
Staying outta human cycle
Awakened soul
Riders voice
Emptiness
Sacrifice
Fading outta life
Evil Voices
Its time to take off
And live the life at fastest speed
And feel the fire live the pain
Sorry pal but I gotta go
There are times you let go
But there are times you must stand
ground and fight
Living on the edge
Growing up in flames
Screaming
And feeling
My pain
Burning tires wheeling flames
Riding outta hell Im an easy rider
But now its time to return
To get back the things youve lost
And live in fire heal your wounds
Thats the pace of life my friend
Burning tires never tamed
Riding outta hell Im easy rider
Burning tires heart in flames
Riding outta hell were easy rides
Twisting minds and souls of people
Victims of own schemes
Envy lust geed gully
not shall rob or kill
Deny this path and you
gonna find the guiding light
Landless lords manipulating
Theyre abusing
Were victims of their sins
Envy lust geed gully
not shall rob or kill
Embrace this path and you
gonna find the darkest light
see the grasp of the damn
in the still of the noght
Death and glory they found
Feeling the taunt of time
where this glory was found
Frightened people called weaklings
They are their herds
Victims of their schemes
Envy lust geed gully
not shall rob or kill
Embrace this path and you
gonna find a twisted light
Mesmerizing and controlling
Spreading their words
Always living with fear
Envy lust geed gully
not shall rob or kill
Embrace this path and you
gonna find the final light
Feel the cold of the dawn
In the still of the night
A sign of might
And it will remain
Remain until his kingdoms fall
A fathers pledge
From Rainbow gates
Gates from stars
He came to fight
I came to fight trough the worlds
and timeless plans
He came to kill
I came to strike
He came to fight
I came to fight trough the worlds
the hammer of gods
Repeat first verse
Despite his fate he kept on fighting
A terrible foe a gift from his brother
Death like reward he didnt care
He defended his kingdom from hordes of Hell
Unholy unholy
Unholy alliance from Hell
Destroy them and crush them
No mercy for these bastards
For my country I walk on the rain
Bringing the death and leaving the pain
Riding steel horses and striking at night
Fire and torches blaze in our heart
A desperate fight
Arrows crossing high
Flying through the skies
Listen to their cries
Lord please save us
Charge
And take their lives
Fight
We came to win and not to fall
Marching we go
through the batlle we fight
We fight with our heart
Death and glory well find
Steel believing in power and might
Might of the Metal
Hail and Kill
With leather and spikes
we made the Metal
MarchBuildings of dark crumbling stone
A presence of malice and horrors unknown
Vast endless stairways and halls
From black yawning portals insanity calls
In ruins aeons old
beneath the sea
the Ancients long to be free
They lie dead and dreaming
at this fallen site
waiting for their soon coming reign
When their slaves start dreaming
and the stars are right
they'll awake again and reclaim
the Earth
Nightmares cause mindnumbing fear
to poets and artists all over the world
Strange visions are haunting their sleep
A city of madness that lurks in the deep
Timeless terrors rise
Insanity
awaits for all humanity
The Great Old Ones shall reign again
When the morning has broken
can you see the great open sky
or are you afraid to enter life
From your world's obligations
I have struggled to get away
and now I'm finally free
From the land of order I'm hiding
In the hand of shelter I roam
There's a light beyond the mountains
and there's where I go
When the Maker rock the boat
the unbelievers dive together
Tonight we celebrate our neverending flight
And together side by side we run into the light
I'm a needle in your eye
I'm the one you can never be
You're a dutiful drudge lost in time
There is no use denying
labour and guilt will always rule
your predictable realm
There are preachers among the fools
spinning tales of laws and rules
It's a language spoken in vain
I will never learn to take the blame
Anywhere where the word is told
speculations steal the show
Its a never ending ignorance
Any rumour they believe
Any secret they reveal
They are blinded by their arrogance
Vultures of lies stain my dignity
with their eternal insanity
I stand before the narrow mind
A victim of opinions
All has the right to judge my life
Here in the fools dominion
An invention in the wind
or a guess of what could be
is enough to draw an inference
What is wrong and what is right
what is black and what is white
Will they ever learn the difference
In the forest of silver and haze
where the children of yesterday play
We sail away on a river of dreams
bound to carry the night side by side
No tomorrow no clouds in the sky
Just the echo of time passing by
We hold the moment and glide with the wind
to wherever the stars may decide
Eyes of thousands are shining in the night
for the power of sound in the neon lights
Smoke and thunder excitement and delight
We all come alive in the land of memories
where our destinies unite in harmony
See the beauty embracing the beast
to the magic of song in the breeze
In the eye of the storm they are lost
gazing over the field where spirits fly
I recall another day
I recall another place
No matter how far you go
you'll always be heading home
Immortal words in the wind
sung by the stars will guide your way
Now I stand here alone
watching over shadows
on this field of death
I slowly raise my head
I can't escape or deny
the pain I carry inside
But I will rise again
before the night descends
Armed to prevail and eager to slay
I can't rest until I get my revenge
Raise your banners
Raise your banners high
Into battle  Into war we'll ride
Rumbling under the sky
the brave are waiting to fight
Laughing at your gods
I'll crush your filthy hearts
Let the wind of war whine
as the chaos arise
What will be will be
This is my destiny
You'll taste my blade in one final breath
I can't rest until you're wiped off this earth
Warriors Sight your preys
Victory lies ahead
Warriors Sight your preys
Victory lies ahead
Raise your banners
Raise your sword and shield
Die with honour on the battlefield
I see a face in the mirror
with weary eyes and far from a smile
Who is he Where is he going
Is he a man or is he a child
What's the point trying to be a star
when you can't figure out who you are
It's a shame fighting for a dream
that you can't live in reality
The road to nowhere will never end
The mask you wear is your only friend
You may survive on the desert plains
but always find that the quest remains
Are you a saint or a sinner
Do you belong in Heaven or Hell
Are you a loser or a winner
I guess only time will tell
There's no use counting tears in the rain
or denying the sorrow and pain
It's too late when you realise
that the mirror is your very eyes
Beyond the doors of the living
where imagination fades
The eyes of ancient ages
are gazing over a crimson shade
The future unfolds with the rising sun
Unspoken words where nothing yet's been done
Where the book of life paints the sky
Dawn dancer share your mind
Tell me the story of tomorrow
Dawn dancer let me know
the one way I must follow
Dawn dancer turn the page
Where do I go and what is my fate
Dawn dancer tell me all
Now before it is too late
A warning from the unknown
A prophecy for the wise
The coming lies before you
but can you see your own demise
A distant sight visualize our doom
Destiny calls and the future looms
Where the book of life paint the sky
I'm ready for the end
Let us find it together
I'm ready for knowledge
I've been waiting forever
Behold the eternal loner
escaping his troubled mind
A stranger caught in the wheel of time
The lost traveller is fighting
to hold back the passing days
but there're no breaks on the train of life
Can I forgive Can I forget I don't know
Maybe the wind of death will solve it all
Somewhere I went astray
in labyrinths of my soul
I try to find my way
walking along endless
roads of loneliness
The eyes of the solitary
are nailed to the empty view
of everlasting uncertainty
How long do I have to struggle
when no battle's to be won
It's all a perpetual insanity
Jaws of devastation
breathing fire in my face
Words of oppression bite me with disgust
Eyes of condemnation
piercing my forsaken soul
Another sacrifice has to be done
In the altar's shadow
I confess my heresy
I'm a perfect sinner
unbound and free
All my demons come alive
inside the temple of immortal shame
Lord have mercy on me now
I have no other choice but to lie
straight in the face of Death
Claws of frozen hatred
wrapping tight around my neck
as I'm allowed to answer the foul beast
Can I cheat to be spared
from the hand of slavery
or will my true intentions be revealed
Life only for the brave
Whips and chains only for the slaves
I am no slave
Night falls on the battlefield
where the blood of heroes lie
Still dying with sword in hand
I await the northern lights
Borne on the wings of fate they'll come
to grant my final ride
To the land of the glorious dead up high
where I shall be given eternal life
With the bravest warriors I'll unite
On the plain of consecration I'll fight
In the home of the slain
there is only room for the chosen ones
Let me die bold and brave
to deserve my place in the Halls of Valhalla
All my life I have been yearning
for this battle to come
Night and day I have been fighting
for my prize to be won
Death calls in the chilling wind
How I yearn to bid farewell
to the Earth and mortality
and the sky I know too well
Borne on the wings of fate they'll come
to grant my final ride
Odin Expose your kingdom in the sky
Embrace my soul now as I die
Nothing remains between me and the stars
So now I'm claiming my reward
Asgard awaits Asgard awaits
Let me come home
Don't forget me don't forsake me
Let me come home
Home to my father where I was meant to be
Before too long no more singers no more songs
Oh no last call you had a chance you lost it all
Burn slow no excuse so unkind born to lose
Right now no doubt in a world of pain no way out
No remorse can't cope no getaway up in smoke
Can't see your face no more hanging in the sky
If I could find the cure I wouldn't have to cry
I know the law I know how to die
Take the wild ride teach you how to fly
Be on my side I hate them long goodbyes
Don't believe in miracles and I won't even try
I know the law I know how to die
No more lies no excuse walk a mile in my shoes
Can't see the way no more needles in my eyes
Rotten to the core hang me out to dry
Give me satisfaction or a damn good reason why
Cross your heart and hope to die
Stay on the right track you can't live a lie
Make sure you don't go back look me in the eye
Know I ain't no angel broken wings don't fly
I know the law I know how to die
We live on borrowed time hope turned to dust
Nothing is forgiven we fight for every crust
We are the chosen few we are the frozen crew
We don't know what to do just wasting time
But we'll get over it get back in line
Everything forgotten specially the facts
We are the dogs of war don't even know what for
But we obey the law get back in line
We are trapped in luxury starving on parole
We are the sacrifice and we don't like advice
We always pay the price pearls before swine
Now we are only slaves already in our graves
If you think that Jesus saves get back in line
Nobody's mad like me I don't know how to speak
Nobody's mad like me I like to see the sky
Nobody knows me knows what I desire
I know where the lightning strikes
I know why the vampire bites
I've spoken with the restless dead
I know the minds of rats
And the wrong side of the tracks
I hear the devils in my head
Nobody's on your side forgotten how to scream
Nobody sees you nobody sees your pain
I know where the black flags fly
I know where immortals die
I have heard the mountain giants tread
I have seen the death of worlds
I know the wizards words
I hear the devils in my head
Nobody crazy like me I'll make you believe
Nobody's crazy like me I know the nights alive
Ride the electric storm to the infected dawn
Nobody would believe what we have spawned
I know the way to hell
I know the padded cell
I have seen many heroes die
I know your nightmares too
And who sends them to you
The one who makes the children cry
I see the cruel insane
I feel their unknown pain
I feel the knives inside their heads
I see we are all doomed
I see blood on the moon
I hear the devils in my head
Time goes by real slow and you know how it feels
Rock n Roll music is the true religion
Never let you down you can dance to the rhythm
Rock N Roll even gonna set you free
Make the lame walk and the blind to see
Gonna take you back to where you wanna be
Do it till the day I die
Make you feel good get some real wood
Put that together real soon
Rock n Roll music is the true religion
Never let you down you can dance to the rhythm
Rock n' Roll even gonna set you free
Make the lame walk and the blind to see
Gonna take you back to where you wanna be
Do it till the day I die
Rock music can wake the dead
You know it's true when it fills your head
Better remember what I said you never get enough
Rock n roll music gonna set you free
Know its gonna knock you outta your tree
Rock n' Roll Rock n' Roll Rock n' Roll
Rock n' Roll dance to the music
Rock n' Roll you know you can't refuse it
Rock n' Roll don't you abuse it
I don't know what I like I don't know what I am
I know a few things baby I know we're in a jam
And if your eyes are closed I better stay awake
You are a mystery you are a bitch to me
The way I feel tonight you'll never see me break
We might not see tomorrow waiting for the snake
Hiding behind the door don't get us any place
I know that you believe and so before the freeze
I see you pale and crying waiting for the snake
War and murder come again lucky if you die
When the music changes then all is broken down
Mighty cities laid to ruin burning to the ground
Murder is become the law you cannot make a stand
Faith in lying prophets no one to lift the spell
History is mystery do you know what it means
Our legacy is lunacy brotherhood of man
We are worse than animals we hunger for the kill
We are disease upon the world brotherhood of man
Outlaw cut down in your prime
Outlaw see the blue sky one last time
Outlaw that's all
Live or die win or lose can't be sure no excuse
Outlaw cut down in your tracks
Outlaw so much for the man in black
Outlaw that's all
Outlaw face down in the dirt
Outlaw the one that kills you never hurts
Outlaw lying in the street
Outlaw the last gunslinger you will meet
Outlaw that's all
He's a voodoo Medusa gonna turn you into stone
Will you obey the master when he sets you free
Don't you think there'll be a price
I know what you are I know what you need
He's a true believer gonna crucify your soul
Can you be sure his heart is pure
I know what you are I know what you need
Now here's the execution all around your bed
Will you to turn and laugh as they burn
I know what you are I know what you need
Will you cry when you're buried alive
You don't know me baby but I know you so well
Tried to make a fool of me tried to ring my bell
Sneaking round behind my back didn't make me cry
Gonna make a fool of you watch out
Make your life a misery make you shut your mouth
Gonna tell a tale on you make your blue eyes cry
Running round this city running outta tales
Gonna be a sad day for you soon
Make your life a mockery twist you out of tune
Gonna do some work on you and only you know why
Gonna make a fool of you watch out
Make your life a misery make you shut your mouth
Gonna tell a tale on you make your blue eyes cry
All faces wax pale
Deep within the trembling begins
Trumpets sounding warning and war
Watching from a tower of sin
Over the mountain
Comes the Black Swarm
As the dawn spreading
His dark army comes raging
A day of gloom and darkness
Nothing at all can escape
They move as horses of war
Ears bleeding from the roar
And the sound of crackling fire
They leap from peak onto peak
They move with a blink of the eye
They scale the walls like locust
They crush through all defenses
They do not break their ranks
Tear and shred your hearts
For they are coming for you
They fly from the sky like hail
All faces wax pale
What dread to be found
In grasp of an angry God
At the lifting of the veil
All faces wax pale
Going on before them a raging fire consumes
Left in wake behind them a blazing fire burns
Lain in glory before them a virgin garden looms
They rush into the city
Pitch black flood pouring over the walls
There is no refuge from them
Through each crevice they crawl
At the very sight of their shadows
The blood drains from every face
Tear and shred your hearts
For they are coming for you
They fly from the sky like hail
All faces wax pale
What dread to be found
In grasp of an angry God
At the lifting of the veil
All faces wax pale
The Strong execute His Word
Who can endure it
Open your spiritual eyes
Even now they come your way
You cannot stand against them
The hounds of Heaven seek your soul
No one and nothing at all can escape this force
They do not break their ranks
Who can endure it
See even now they come your way
The hounds of Heaven seek your soul
Seek your soul
The Crucifix immersed in piss
The Holy Virgin smeared in excrement
The body of Christ in disembowelment
The words of Christ mocked and twisted
The Son of God called a bastard
The Word of God torn to pieces
The House of God desecrated
When all is told when its said and done
Id hate to be you
Before the dawn we gather we are drawn
Moving in cold state
With hearts of fire of Spirit and of power
In these hallowed halls
Is knowledge for the Called
Derived from the Source
Our concoctions lain before us
Seven feasts arranged in chorus
Bowed heads signal entry of the force
Shiloh Shiloh
Glory of battles won
Shiloh Shiloh
Victories to come
Shiloh Shiloh
Praise for battles fought
Shiloh Shiloh
Crowns adorn the Sought
Teaching our eyes to see beyond our minds
Behold the spiritual realms
These ancient mysteries provide a way
Drinking of blood and tasting bitter hyssop
Enlightening the soul
Accept this sacrifice
Disemboweling whats inside
Laid in a watergrave and from this death we rise
Gannon Chapman Eckel
Standing proud to greet their sons
Upon seeing the destruction
To the enemy done
To the King they offer these Warriors of Blood
Drinking of blood and tasting bitter hyssop
Enlightening the soul
Accept this sacrifice
Disemboweling whats inside
Laid in a watergrave and from this death we rise
For before the dawn we gather we are drawn
Moving in cold state
With hearts of fire of Spirit and of power
We curse the darkness and destroy our enemies
Curses and Destruction
The searing heat is fading
The fire that burned my skin
My blistered flesh is cooling
With the dying rays of Sun
Dying Sun
The howling winds bring comfort to my weary soul
And I close my eyes and welcome home
The Cold
The dawn of the season of death
Brings a grin to my parched lips
And now the very best of all
Nightfall
The moon in all its brilliance
Shimmers through the chrystalled sky
To illuminate this winters night
And smiles as nature dies
Nature dies
I hear the silence as it permeates the dark
Im reborn
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂFor a spirit evil this way comes
Lament and howl for this spirit from the North
As a lion coming up from its lair
It will destroy youÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ
He will throw you down your blood splatters
Youll be trampled underfoot your body mangled
Youll become as refuse on the ground
When they go to bury you nothing will be found
For dogs will tear and eat your rotting flesh
Your bones will be crushed and turned to dust
But this is just a taste of your fate
In this you can trust
Your mothers and your daughters will be ravished
Your pregnant wife ripped open torn apart
He will make your laughter turn to sorrow
He will turn your joy to agony
All that you have gained will burn in fire
He is on His way
Open your ears listen well
When youre destroyed you will feel Hell
It will be better for Gomorrah
Than for you on that Day
Your desolation so cruel and complete
The flesh of your children youll hoard and eat
Open your ears listen well
When youre destroyed will feel Hell
Rise then bathe in Blood of The Way
Then youll be spared this fate
I have tasted grace and it tastes like blood
Everyone who follows Satans evil schemes
Shall bring swift destruction on their heads
Exploiting their children with satanic lies
But He cast them straight to hell
Sodom and Gomorrah condemned
By burning them to ashes
Example of the sentence of the wicked
Throwing down in violence
With the serpent on fire
My Lord will execute
Judgment on all men
Many are those slain by My Lord
Hear the roar
Coming from the city
Tremble at His words
Hear the noise from the temple
Its the wrath
The sound of my Lord
Repaying all His enemies all that they deserve
Now go out
Look on the dead bodies
Those who rebelled against my Lord
Their worm will not die
Their fire wont be quenched
So now they rot in executions fury
Throwing down in violence
With the serpent on fire
My Lord will execute
Judgment on all men
Many are those slain by My Lord
Children of the Serpent Oh accursed brood
Their souls delight in their abominations
I will choose harsh treatment for them
I will bring upon them what they dread
For when I called no one answered
When I spoke no one listened to me
Doing evil in my sight
They shall meet their end together
When you face my wrath
You will pray for death
It will not come
I am the War Club
The weapon for battle
I shatter nations
I destroy kingdoms
I shatter horse and rider
Chariot and driver
I shatter man and woman
I shatter boy and maiden
I come with a destroyer
And you will be shattered
As in the days of Midians defeat
You will be shattered
Stand with the gods of Marduk
And you will be shattered
Devise your strategies
And you will be shattered
Lift up the banner
Sound the trumpet
Prepare for battle
For I come like a locust swarm
You will become
A heap of ruins
A haunt for jackals
The object of horror and scorn
I come with a destroyer
And you will be shattered
As in the days of Midians defeat
You will be shattered
Stand with the gods of Marduk
And you will be shattered
Devise your strategies
And you will be shattered
By Azahel by Sebat
By Adonijah by Qoheleth
How broken and shattered
Is the hammer of the earth
How broken and shattered
Is the hammer of the earth
Baal and Anubis Belial and Osiris
Molech and Lillith Odin and Ounis
I will throw you away
Like a menstrual rag
You are nothing more
Than menstrual blood
Like whirlwinds sweeping
The invader comes
From a land of terror
My way is a whirlwind and storm
Silent You Madmen
I pile your corpses
On the lifeless forms
Of your worthless gods
I come with a destroyer
And you will be shattered
As in the days of Midians defeat
You will be shattered
Stand with the gods of Marduk
And you will be shattered
Devise your strategies
And you will be shattered
Colours now fading the sun burns dark orange
The trees ominous silhouettes
Foul cease their chorus cold winds taking over
Howling through bleak crevasses
With the forest eclipsed sun
And black clouds erasing stars
The crescent moon hoarding its light for its own
I sense a night is dawning as never seen before
I pray
Come now Take me
Far rises oft blacken the skies
No sounds from above to guide as we roam
Only screams for mercy and more screams belie
So we wander we forsaken
Could this travesty be true
That Creator cursed His creatures to this dark
One Spark
Come now Take me
A longing for the day of my Lord
A foolish and misguided desire
If you knew you would never welcome this wish
For that day is black as pitch abscessed light
Run as though youre fleeing Anubis
Only to enter Deaths Door
Think you have rest betwixt silken sheets
No its a bed of vipers he has laid in store
So now my salvation rises above
So dark that it brightens my night
My nocturnal shining as blinding midday
I hear his voice echoing through my sighs
Disaster from its stillbirth I behold
My canopy around Me is the darkness of the sky
Bow now To Me
I was the only one cause no one else could be
Forever more the time is god
There is time to gain
And whatever we are supposed to do
We cannot change the fact that we are ruled
There is time to gain
I miss the evenings the small talk that we had
I miss your presence the good things and the bad
I smell the morning air the colours of the dawn
Things that matter now when it's out of reach
All the things I took for granted
I do now esteem
Every thing that I neglected
I wish to redeem
In this silence on nowhere island
I can see the life I had passing by
In the place of dying I'm weeping crying
Too late to be forgiven for my sins and lies
In this nowhere I'm looking back on life
What was my vision in life before I died  I know
That this place of emptiness a castody for souls
Will not bring me back no one hear my calls
All the things I took for granted
I don now esteem
Every thing that I neglected
I wish to redeem
In this silence on nowhere island
I can see the life I had passing by
In the place of dying I'm weeping crying
Too late to be forgiven for my sins and lies
My destination the cold eternity
I will forever roam through infinity
And I am doomed to silence in this astral skies
I want to be again I wish I were alive
All the things I took for granted
I do now esteem
Every thing that I neglected
I wish to redeem
In this silence on nowhere island
I can see the life I had passing by
In the place of dying I'm weeping crying
Too late to be forgiven for my sins and
I'm burning  in fire
So hard to stand against the flames
Deception  who told them
About the magic I possess
The power  from your well
Are slowly peter out
Mother  of Tellus
Give me strength
To cast a spell
You burn me now
Before them all
You fear my kind
Because of the things I know
Magic knowledge
Ancient secret rituals
Black forbidden
Maleficium
Save me  I'm dying
Give me a shelter after life
Curse them  my tormentors
Give them the spell of the purple sand
You burn me now
Before them all
You fear my kind
Because of the things I knwo
Magic knowledge
Ancient secret rituals
Black forbidden
Maleficium
I'm boiling  I'm coming
Hail you the guardian of the earth
I'm burning  and dying
But wait and witness my rebirth
You burn me now
Before them all
You fear my kind
Because of the things I know
Magic knowledge
Ancient secret rituals
Black forbidden
Maleficium
The battle's lost
The army scattered in destruction
The king is dead
He drove his sword into a stone
A land without a king
Who'll be the one to follow
No one managed
No man worthy of the throne
Break the spell you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
In his court of Camelot
The knights of the round table
To lead the Britains
Is his life and prophecy
Deceived by Morgana Lefay
His bastard sister
Berawed was left the nation
Of sorrow and of plague
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
Must solve the quest of time
The grail is the salvation
Saved from evil and
Abandoned to be found
Hail the king
Heed the dragon's fire
Called up with anger
From the deepest agony
Break the spell you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
Three rings for the elvenkings under the sky
Seven for the dwarflords in their halls of stone
Nine for the mortal men doomed to die
One for the dark lord on his dark throne
In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie
One ring to rule them all one ring to find them
In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie
The lord of the rings
The one of them all
The lord of the rings
Gets into your soul
Three rings in the elvenland defying the dark
By the mortal men now bearing Sauron's mark
The war of the ring begins on evil ground
In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie
One ring to rule them all one ring to find them
In the land of the dark lord where freedom dies
The lord of the rings
he one of them all
The lord of the rings
Gets into your soul
The crazy man inside my head
Waking up with empty eyes
He envies me wishes that I was dead
My common sense wants to see him die
Taking over more and more
He's screaming through my soul
He uses my eyes to make me see
The world in a twisted reality
The power of madness
Is tearing down my mind
Into the darkness of fools
Where shadows lurk and madness rules
Madness madness madness
Madness is tearing down my mind
Madness madness madness
Madness my senses going blind
Too late for me insanity
Is spreading like a disease
My body shake a nervous ache
I'm going crazy
Help for god's sake
The power of madness
Is tearing down my mind
Into the darkness of fools
Where shadows lurk and madness rules
Madness madness madness
Madness is tearing down my mind
Madness madness madness
Madness my senses going blind
I'm laughing at god
And I'm laughing at satan in hell
I'm fettered in chains on the rack
Suffering god's torture and pain
Inquisition a demon you are
Take a life to find out a false truth
But after you've stolen my life
you'll suffer the vultures' fete
I confess I'm the one take my life
Make it done once and for all
I feel no more care no more see no more
The pain is gone
Madness is stronger than mind
In this land where I am
Everything is fine
You torture me but I am free
I feel nothing crazy me
The power of madness
Is tearing down my mind
Into the darkness of fools
Where shadows lurk and madness rules
Madness madness madness
Madness is tearing down my mind
Madness madness madness
Leave the common sense behind
In the darkness I see her shadow
As a lonely sad silhouette
I'm remorseful but my pride still
Is too strong to accept my regrets
I sit in silence crouched in a corner
I hear the hollow ticking of the clock
My mind is chasing thoughts that are fleeing
Oh god of mercy Do I know what I have done
I rest my head in hands that tremble
I'm repressing thoughts of what I am
I am scared of the power of my feelings
I can't bear the burden of the deeds
I can't trust the nature of my being
Cause my hate is fiery and profound
Each passing minute feels like an eon
Time seems unreal in the presence of death
I'm spinning deeper into my madness
Clinging on to traces of hope
I rest my head in hands that are shaking
I'm denying the facts of what I am
I close my eyes but the scene I'm seeing
Keep's repeating again and again
I can't leash the fury I'm feeling
I cannot break the circle of my rage
I can't trust the nature of my being
'Cos my hate is fiery and profound
The battle's lost
The army scattered in destruction
The king is dead
He drove his sword into a stone
A land without a king
Who'll be the one to follow
No one managed
No man worthy of the throne
Break the spell you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
In his court of Camelot
The knights of the round table
To lead the Britains
Is his life and prophecy
Deceived by Morgana Lefay
His bastard sister
Berawed was left the nation
Of sorrow and of plague
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
Must solve the quest of time
The grail is the salvation
Saved from evil and
Abandoned to be found
Hail the king
Heed the dragon's fire
Called up with anger
From the deepest agony
Break the spell you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
Your assembly and requiem your prophecy of doom
The redeemer in the sky did he laugh or cry
Mad messiah salvation by fire
If he told you what to do god must be evil too
Dehumanized then sacrificed to an empty sky
Mad Messiah salvation by fire
You lead them
I am the lord of the fallen
The ultimate rebel from paradise
A philosopher free thinking breed
The sovereign of anarchy
Legionaries of every tribe
This is where we dwell
A place of eternal dusk
We are the dignitaries of hell
Here we shall rule
Even though it isn't hell
I will retake
My lost paradise
Into the garden of Eden
As a serpent I come to tempt
I offer you to taste the fruit
From the tree of knowledge
I make you a demigod
I give you my thoughts
I want to make sure that you will be
A rebellion to the trinity
Here we shall rule
Even though it isn't hell
I will retake
My lost paradise
Fallen into the abyss of fire
Fallen into the abyss of fire
Have I seen all there is to see
Or is there more left to be
The deepest of thoughts
The fantasies the neverending
Harmonies
Here I am locked in reality
In a world of anxiety
I have to escape
Explore the possibilities
Can dreams become true
On a unicorn I am riding
To the wonderland
I'll hold her silver mane face a dream
I wonder if I will return
From my journey to the wonderland
Far away deep within universe
Through the arcades of mystery
The dullness is gone
My mind collecting pieces
Of a life I will live
On a unicorn I am riding
To the wonderland
Me they will rehabilitate with
A straitjacket on
They wonder if I will return
From my journey in the wonderland
They are searching but they can't find
I am hiding inside my mind
Can you keep a secret I'm not me
I am forever in my fantasy
On a unicorn I am riding
To the wonderland
I'll hold her silver mane face a dream
I wonder if I will return
From my journey to the wonderland
Wonderland wonderland
Take me to that neverland
Wonderland
Before god you must tell the truth
As you know this is a trial
What have I done I am innocent
I do not understand
Oh I see you deny the crimes
Let us find out what is true
What do you do What's going on
Tell me where I am
Welcome to the cellar of pain
Let the questioning begin
I'm the chief magistrate
In god I put my faith
Blasphemous lying beast
The devil is your lord
Insane a big mistake
What have you been told
I want you to tell me
Kneel and confess what you are
I'm a master of torture
But the pain that you feel is the dark
The source of
The source of pain
To the end of your life and forever more
The source of
The source of pain
To the end of your life and forever more
Look around what you see
Is gonna make you talk
Chains and racks don't frighten me
I'm innocent and free
Is that a sarcastic tongue
I hear in front of me
I don't care what you think
But scare me you cannot
I want you to tell me
Kneel and confess what you are
I'm a master of torture
But the pain that you feel
Is the dark
The source of
The source of pain
It's too late
I talked
I told them everything
Not absolved but laid bare
I've looked through all the windows
I've gone through all the drawers
More empty now than ever before
We're going down to hell together or not at all
Let 'em kill
So who's the deviant in this success story
It's too late
It's too late
It's too late
I confessed  sold you out
Dear victim
I'm a long time listener but a first time caller
Dear victim I just wanted to say how sorry
I don't feel about your loss and my place in it
A better world
What would you do in a better world
But here I go again
Making one more enemy
Oh here it comes again
I said the wrong thing
I did the wrong thing
Tore through your safe space
A slap in the victim's face
Attack defend attack again
One of them I'm one of them
Attack defend attack again  one of them
So you've got a system down
How to keep them all running around
Dishing out apologies so they never stop to say
Then sister you know it's guilty of everything
Crash course in burning out
I said I'd never be the kind
So stuck in glory days
They forget to let dead bury their own
So what is this that's trying to slow me down
I remember the songs the saved me
And the words that came so easy
And the pulpits that sprang up beneath our feet
All that confidence wasted on the young
We tapped that vein and bled it dry
Now nothing fits yeah but what ever did
We always thought that we had time
To let the dead bury their own
We always thought that we had time
This is the one Baptist
I can feel it in the air
The warden's call in the eleventh hour
And it's easy to say but it's hard to remember
That praise is for suckers and death is forever
Under your nose but just over your head
Martyr meets maker in ten shades of red
These are your twelve steps
Take them on your knees
These are your twelve steps
Take them on your knees
Show them the blood and you get in for free
Under your nose but just over your head
Martyr meets maker in ten shades of red
And I've got a one track mind
And you know it's gonna get me tried
I've got a one track mind
And one of these days it's gonna get me baptized
I've got a one track mind and you know
Line twenty six admits to martyr envy
Hot from the floor
And ready to serve
This is your head on a canvas looking my way
And the kitchen's going to need the plate back
While their young necks fit in your hands
They grow like weeds when you let them
Yeah
You lost your head to a pretty face Baptist
He's passed out for the night
Lived in one house all his life
You can count the decades in his eyes
All the awful liars all the perfect thieves
Never asked for more
Faithful service and standardized routines
And when he dies alone with nothing in hand
Burned out shell of a working man
When he dies alone with empty hands 
Stamps it void and throws it on a pile
We take care of our own at least on paper
We take care of our own
Who gets his number
They've got words I never heard
And with thirty three degrees of separation
In between the indoctrinated and the paranoid
Someone turn the lights on
In the concrete
In the context
Blindness of the ages passed on to the children
Built the courthouse
The lies that fall from the books we trusted
The skull and bones that rise again
The devils in the details in the walls
Someone turn the lights on
Got an old and sinking feeling
That the wolves are at my doorstep
And always have been
Someone turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Someone turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Turn the lights on
Who killed the time
What's left that's mine
Face down in a nation of thieves
What do you do when you're not on your knees
Drawing out nine to five disease
You kill the time get back in line
Last of the great team players
Just payments away from freedom
Signed out like a company car
He leaves behind a trail of scars
And a morbid fear of closedin spaces
Collared shirts and dying alone
Power station exploded
They're all watching it go down
This is a heatwave
This is a heatwave
This is a heatwave
Someone's gonna get burned
And all your trust boils down to this
The neighbor's hands that hold your wrists tight
Tight
Tight around your property rights
Hands on you
Eyes on you
Teeth in you in the dark
The clock has stopped
No alarm went off
Remember when you slept with doors unlocked
Well that was then and this is now
And this is now
And this is a heatwave
Someone's gonna get burned
Someone always gets burned
Discharged to a normal life in a room
That's two feet wide and six feet deep
When all else fails you are the wind
That sets their sails to a war
Played out before you were born
Business as usual
It's business as usual
Your business as usual is killing us all
No glorious deeds etched into a wall
Blood on your hands
When hell comes home there's hell to pay
This is the price of oilA devious drop
In a restless deep
Unsuspicious of the eve
Wake of carbon reaction
Pierce through the chasm
A mass that can't be explained
Can't avoid the attainable under none
Karma so inescapable
One into a colony
In metabolic steps
Gap the range
Beyond themselves reverberate
Out of nowhere resurrection
A drop of complexion
Thrives out of control
Complexity
No longer null
Unavoidable attainableÃÂ 
Under none
Seed that'll ever be a seed
That'll ever outgrow
And will cover every shred of land
Feed that'll ever be the feed
That'll never halt or slow
And will cover everything that is
Just a step away from never sailing
Heritage grows close and we're receding
Just a step away from never sailing
Heritage grows close and we're receding
Just a step away from never sailing
Heritage grows close and we're receding
No wildest shine on the briefest time
Would know what took it there to know
As the tide that we're in flows
No second will ever be the same again
Ingeminate the day in parallel reiteration
Happily doing more of the same
Knowing all that's needed to know so far
Emergent new attributes on sand
Bred patterns floating water remains
Stating itself forever in twisted chains
In constant revelation
Hear the nothing find its speak
Everlasting uncertainty
Generations led to breed
Fever permeate all that can breathe
Created on its own
Unleashed through the end
No loneliest cry from the youngest hatch
Will know what took for it to be here
And the melting rocks will grow
Like islands of mutual solitude
To do what's made to do
Fulfillment beyond karma
Inescapable malediction
Ingeminate the day in parallel reiteration
Happily doing more of the same
Knowing all that's needed know so far
Emergent new attributes on sand
Bred patterns floating remains
Stating itself forever in twisted chains
In constant revelation
Hear the nothing find its speak
Everlasting uncertainty
Generations led to breed
Fever permeate all that can breathe
No more the same
Every shard met its own fate
Over a billion times
And is back
Cannot resist alone
No more
Resist to be devoured
Collective
Collective
No longer alone as the world tries to swallow us
Together we will thrive
To rearrange the order we're in
Transparently organize the nexus of the chain
I weld you cling on you
We can't be told away
A link you can't escape
For I help you to see
Collective
Collective
As the world tries to shatter us
And disintegrate into quantum
We're an army bonded by grief
With weaponry forged in blood
Spawning back from hell
Right there I can barely reach
Way above my further thoughts
Where dreams are little more than ghosts
The outer world pulsates
And dwarfs the one inside
But it's a mirror to me
Voar alÃÂÃÂ©m rasgar a pelÃÂÃÂ­culaÃÂ 
Que separa o desafio da conquista
Quebrar o espelho e sangrar minhas mÃÂÃÂ£os
Rubi escuro cristalino e inspirador
A claridade que ofusca e isola
Penetra a casca e redefine a dor
AtÃÂÃÂ© o limite a vida por um fio
Invisible to us
Numerous stars glow faint
A million of dawns
A speck away
Can you see the light
Oscillating through
The looking glass it's allÃÂ 
I want to see
Right there I can barely reach
Way above my further thoughts
Where dreams are little more than ghosts
The outer world pulsates
And dwarfs the one inside
My skin shines like dawn
Right there I can barely see
Way beyond my deepest fears
Where truth scares me more than ghosts
The inner world pulsates
And grows back outside
But it's all a mirror to me
I want to see the light of day
There's a mind
Looking back longing
I can't see
What no eye ever will
As our moments pass
Bearing no actor or witness
I can't hear
Symphonies that won't come back
Undeservedly they play
For no audience
This is the serenade
Without a lover's ear to hear
We're lost in time
Trapped in here
I've lost my mind
Even my senses weren't here
We're lost in time
Wrecked in sea
I've lost my life
But can't escape theÃÂ 
Echoes of the waves
I need you to acquiesce to my pride
Forever bonded in mutual destiny
We're two proto legions summing our might
To foster and to protect now
I need you to breathe through my lungs
Would you help me growing
Through the time we're living at
Would you help me blooming
Through the rocks that stifle us
Would you help me crawling
Out of this god forsaken mire
Come with me and let us foster our child
Wandering stepping the same
Keeping the pace that will take us away
Our essence living again
Outside ourselves but the same entity
Opposite complement a knotÃÂ 
Both aiming at the same goal
Like arrow and bullseye we share a purpose
Our substance as a child remains
Outside ourselves but forever
Expanding and overlapping
In complex pattern forms
Cutting sand like a rusted knife
Leaving scars in the soil
Contrast in the gray
Veins pulse through the clay
A thousand eyes overhead
Watch the bleeding
Fluids are coming alive
Wounds are healing
Out of the blue all is new
Flocks are breeding
Changing the face of a world
That's been waiting
Who've seen the miracle
Now I can feel the SunÃÂ 
I want to breathe in the Sun
Who's been alive
I'm going to seize the day
I want to breathe in the day
Caressing with desire
The wind waves by
Reshaping the beasts stones and seas
Burying the past times
Pushing through blue and red veinsÃÂ 
A hallowed leak of winey blood
Clotting and shattering clustered coloniesÃÂ 
Forever bleed away as now
I can feel strong I can be more
Bleed as the time to be aware is now
I can see the Sun I can eat the Sun
Oh
There's no place left in this globe
Where a flower is not in bloom
As the engine runs in full
Explosions keeping its march
A combustible thrust
Nucleotides yielding horsepower
The whole feedbacks its parts
An aftermath way beyond its current grasp
A single earthling is moreÃÂ 
Than Earth once was
Wipe out the hallowed land
Wipe out the immortal land
Add more power on each rotation
In guilds and tribes
In states and cries
This world pulses alive
The noise deafens the blind
Oh
There's no place left in this globe
Not stained by slaughtered blood
As the engine runs in full
Running running
Look at paradise
It's all there holding on
For you to avail
All that was left behind
By you and me
Is now under soil strata
Retained
You do have the means
But have no ends
In a constant today
That blurs future and past
In a household of sensations
Thrilling to every touch
With walls of flesh
Cornered in stones of bonesÃÂ 
Under a guise we share the same lot
Our marrow is the same
But we don't want it to be
Living a fable in our own minds
We faced a choice of life
But we chose not to be
We laugh at our own songs
We mock of our own seeds
We stab at our own hopes
And we lock away what remainÃÂ 
We could ever long
For a light beam to shine upon
Our failed intuitionÃÂ 
And system
In an eternal war to succeed
Spoiling the land
With castles of grief
And trenches of sadness
Devastate
Evolution of our planet
When the age of man will be erased
From negliegence of distant past
Extinction Level Event
Eradicate
Cast away the mass appeal
As burning rock falls from the sky
Scales of time weigh our fate
Prayers to heaven cannot save

Triumphant seizure

Sensation comes over me as I start the insision
Her sweet blood as my lubrication
First I kill them then leave them to decompose
Before I start the dismemberment
Aroused by the stench of their putrid innards
Kill you gut then I fuck you
My necrophile urges is overwhelming
The remains dissolved in acid
Cunts and tits are kept as trophies
Razor to your mouth cutting away lips and tongue
Forcing the remains down your fucking throat
Regurgitation commencing mixing blood with puke
The stench of it all fills me with such delight
Ramming my swollen member up her butchered twat
While I decapitate her with my sharpened axe
On her severed head I'm soon ready to cum
A perverted sensation fills my mind
First I mutilate
Time to masturbate
Then I ejaculate
Ramming my swollen member up her butchered twat
While I decapitate her with my sharpened axe
Snapshots are taken to feed my inner demon
To be spread out later and covered with semen
Covered with semen
I stalk my prey at night
Young females I have in sight
Forcing you home with me
To fulfil my perverse fantasy
Put on my latex glove
Take off your pants
Bend over bitch
Rectal disembowelment
Pulling guts out of your ass
Rectal disembowelment
You'll die slowly and not fast
I stalk my prey at night
Young females I have in sight
Forcing you home with me
To fulfil my perverse fantasy
You will die slowly
From my anal treatment
What would you prefer to call
Someone who loves to fuck
Dead and mutilated midget bitched
Just take your pick and choose
I stand now here before you
Sodomize and kill you
Cover your naked corpse in feces
My climax comes as I shred
Your tiny cunt to fucking pieces
Necromantic
Midget fucker
What you would prefer to call
Someone like me
Well I don't fucking care
Coz I'll murder you anyway
Then I'll decapitate you
And leave your head on a stick
And if your limbs are sliced and diced
I might be tempted to fuck you twice
Raped by a pack of undead
Left mutilated but still alive
Nine months pregnant
But fetus was left uninfected
Fetus left uninfected
Puking up gastric acid
As the virus runs through your veins
Giving birth while in zombified state
No turning back now it's all too late
Your only need is now to feed
Hungry teeth sinking in
Chewing away on infant intestines
Digging it's way through bones and guts
The hunger for human flesh drives you nuts
Giving birth while in zombified state
No turning back now it's all too late
Your only need is now to feed
Munching on te brain of your newborn child
Zombified infanticide
Possessed by satan and driven by hunger
An insatiable lust for human flesh
She will torture murder then slurp your brain
These acts of bestiality drives her insane
She will torture murder then slurp your brain
Beware
She is pentagrandma
Pentagrandma
The ultimate experience in sickening brutality
Slicing and gutting young filthy whores
Long deep gashes out deep in your flesh
To be filled with diahoerretic shit
Long deep gashes out deep in your flesh
To be filled with diahoerretic shit
Slashing your face with rusty barbwire
The ultimate display of sickening desire
Excremental maniac
You fucking whore
Waking up at night with unstoppable quivers
Raw meat the only way to stop my shiver
Keep their remains in the fridge for my next fix
Don't want old bitches I prefer young chicks
Nibble on her perky tits like strawberry jelly
Extinguish the hunger in my famished belly
Chewing my way below her mangled waist
Her clit and labia with such delicious taste
Munching on fingers as if they were fries
Need to consume humans to achieve my high
Juicy tits to die for and hung like a horse
Her erected member will stab you like a knife
Acid infested semen will make you pulverize
Stab your fucking throat
Insert her rotten cock
Into the gaping wound
Shemale throatfuck
Brutally sodomizing to please her own fixation
Meatcleaver to your face
Fueled by furious anger and rage
While she laughs
Juicy tits to die for and hung like a horse
Shemale throatfuck
Shemale throatfuck
Beaten and sedated naked on the table
It's hard to scream with vocalcords disabled
Drugged up and ready for my grotesque experiment
From neck to feet covered in piss and excrements
Time to die filthy bitch
Both barrels blazing so the cavity gets bigger
Her mangled cadaver gets my juices flowing
Rape torture and sodomy is what keeps me going
Tits blown off and lying in chunks on the floor
Yet my urge is not satisfied I hunger for more
Smashing your fucking face
Raping your bleeding mouth
Peeling out your eyes
Sluts like you I despise
Double barrel penetration
Get ready for my backshot penetration
Double barrel penetration
Uterovaginal mastication
Where should I find pain  Here Where I belong
And a cold sarcastic requiem plays for no one
I've walked into the darkenlighten my old sores
Waiting answers from Aeon
And the walls become the mirror of my being
I've mourned all my dismal dreams
Crawling from the edge
There's no return for no one
I am living it  nothing is sacred anymore
Oh I'm so meaningless
There's no return for no one
I am living it  nothing is sacred anymore
Inside my darkest room
And silence became the most desirable disbelief
Pain  not salvation
It's overcoming the fear
Time Eternity wears a fragile scene
And a sinner's bliss becomes my lament
As the dark strives to unveil me
Irreligious screams of hate
Waiting secrets from below
My last sigh to face the outside Oh it hurts
I've mourned all my dismal dreams
Crawling from the edge
There's no return for no one
I am living it  nothing is sacred anymore
Oh I'm so meaningless
There's no return for no one
I am living it  nothing is sacred anymore
Inside my darkest room
Reditus ad Vitam  Maesti Fortuna
Obscurior Aedes
Maeror Est  Propter Me
A strange theory
Upon a stranger that it's me
After all the blood I've shed was in vain
The dark insists to be  A companion of misery
Like the sea of the banished touched the shores
Sorrow lives near me
Coldness
An old euphony
Changed to offer agony
Did He open the aged gates of Babylon
Behold divinity  A shameful irony
As a man falls with his icons and visions
Sorrow lives near me
Coldest fate
All the questions remain inside this room
Let none see my existence
Is the circle created for the rebirth
Depraved in a world of tragedy
Oh can't you see
In aeternus nox
Miru tristis aura Est
Nulli sunt cernet
Vitavita mea
Reditus ad Vitam
Maesti Fortuna
Obscurior Aedes
Would you try to face this life
Now vanished for a world
Delirium
The sweet state of mind  frail selfobsession
Covered by our dimness needs
The seeds of life are fading constantly
A faked reality or is it a fake of the real me
 And then I fall again
Into the depths of loneliness
 And then I fall again
Into the depths of loneliness
Should I try to face the light
I was sightless by the years
Are the walls feeding of my blood
Or is it just imagination
Spitting the last weep of hate
Eternal grief  fading sense of life
A faked reality or is it a fake of the real me
Waves of vanished fantasies
From a man drifting away
The haven of hallucinations
Where the 3rd circle awaits
The dark consumes my soul
As the light blinds my way
The unnamed graceful pain
Lies deep inside of me
 Will I fall again
Into the depths of loneliness
Waves of vanished fantasies
From a man drifting away
  The haven of hallucinations
Where the 3rd circle awaits
The dark consumes my soul
As the light blinds my way
The unnamed graceful pain
Lies deep inside of me
Where the 3rd circle awaits
A gentle breeze whispered in my ear
You're safe now
You're safe now
Am I
Softly hands caressing me
I  I couldn't see her face
You're safe now
You're safe now
I could only hear her voice
You're safe now
You're safe now
And a strange act began
Do you hear a sadist overture
 I can heed dim allusions
Why did you insist to carry on
 I was yearned by inner force
Wait for the damned
  Do you fear the gates I've once ignored
 Gloomy signs affecting me cold
I know what may live behind these ordinary walls
And I must hide to recover
 I'll find a light within our dreams
Perhaps inside the monument of reveries
Wait for the damned
Open your eyes and see what you need to deceive
 Lucidity dares to fade away 
 Nihil sacratus est 
Here's the altar of disharmonic anthems
Shame overflows strictly out of his eyes
What the ancient lust has left 
the remains of a splendorous light
The most wanted rebirth  transcendence envenomed
I'm drifting slowly to the unknown place
 I'm drifting slowly for the unknown place
I found myself within your pain
I found myself within your pain
  You just said
The legacy I once adored is pulling you down
Into a pattern of incomprehension
The principle you believed decays
Unhallowed privilege
Now you believe in me
The place where we dreamt away
Was always a mankind's fake
And beside you lays a crestfallen man
The sadist overture began  enchantment died
What we're seeing deliberates her cry
Unhallowed privilege
Now you believe in me
The place where we dreamt away
 Dark sanctum where you feel
Shame  Overflows strictly out of his eyes
The fragments of a man slowly dying at her side
The most wanted rebirth  transcendence envenomed
A new division seems condemned at the time
The last confession unleashed a palenaked truth
Sacrilege  forbidden word  improved my fall
Resurrection began
I pray whispered  sharing all tears
Laughing as you scream my name
I layweakened sharing all hopes
Madness impaled this soul
TranscendenceEnvenomed
Seconds or days have no meaning now
'Cause every life fades into death somehow
Moments come  moments go
Why the darkness wants me so
Threshold of wails  is it the last resort
An empty promise turned into a sad omen
Moments come
There's a better place to be
Choose your path again or resign your faith
Searching  desperately
For a safe place to rest
But old memories  the thorns of tragedy
Heal me with emptiness
Take me to your Eden
Heal me with our moments
Release me from this life
Seconds of pain served at the same old time
Unstable empathy for the ancient crime
Moments come  There's a better place to be
Choose your path again  don't look back
Searching  desperately
For a safe place to rest
But old memories  the thorns of tragedy
Heal me with emptiness
Take me to your Eden
Heal me with our moments
Release me from this life
Why Did she cross the bridge
Of illusive answers
As the hidden mask unclaimed
Change in the true face of a sinner
Oh no
 Here's the true face of the unbeliever
Why Didn't he look behind
For one last time
And a simple day became
In a conflict of existence
Predicted by themselves  two worlds separated
Or simply just what they have created
Scars have been healed by memories
When there's nothing to believe in
Destiny has changed their faith
Because the trail of sinners has begun
Inside the towers of isolation
Inside the towers of isolation
A loss of faith grows  inside the towers
I replaced life for what I once believed
But now I'm afraid of what I've seen
Predicted by themselves  two worlds separated
Or simply just what what we've been creating
Scars have been healed by memories
When there's nothing to believe in
Destiny has changed their faith
Because the trail of sinners has begun
I replaced life for what I once believed
But now I'm afraid of what I've seen
Inside the towers of isolation
Inside the towers of isolation
A loss of faith grows  inside the towers
Inside the towers
Father forgive me
when my soul retires from you
But I have to go back
to get penitence for all they have done
All the pain caused to me
will come back and I swear
my curse will hit you all
in my return Your souls
will burn forever in comdemness
My last breath
I hear they are coming
The ghosts on my curse
Surround myself
and drill into my lifeless body
And we are flying
In the dark black sky
They are whispering to me
I have to win the fight
Against myself
To write the names of the victims
With bloody hands into the sky
I can see the flames
Sky's burning in my eyes
Burning in my heart
And my soul forever
Let your dreams free
One more time
Never think back in time
Then you burn forever
Can you hear me
I shout your names
You will kneel to pray at me
To save yourselves
But it is me who delivers
All of you for eternity
They are whispering to me
I have to win the fight
Against myself
To write the names of the victims
With bloody hands into the sky
I can see the flames
Sky's burning in my eyes
Burning in my heart
And my soul forever
Let your dreams free
One more time
Never think back in time
Then you burn forever
I will come back  to you
I will come back  to kill you
Burn in hell  forever
He was born again
Living forever
in time and space
Master of darkness
Servant for none
His eyes the fire
A soulless being cursed by sunlight
Excelled by the embrace of the night
In the name of fire
Is the secret of hell
In the name of fire
In damnation and darkness
Hunted by his sins in the past
Now he is back to destroy them
As old as the evil
Wicked like sin
We kneel by the force
He was the power
In the name of fire
Is the secret of hell
In the name of fire
In damnation and darkness
Damnation darkness
Can you see me
Can you feel me
Burning deep inside you
I have been always near to you
I will bring you the new religion
You are the one who
raised me from the dead
I will steal your sleep
Every quiet moment
I have come back to deliver you
I see all your secrets
In your eyes
I feel the fear cause
I am inside yourself
My kiss survived
two thousand years
Changing the whole life on earth
Do you recognize myself
I am the air that you breathe
Welcome  in the damned circle
Welcome  in a dark place
Welcome  in the damned circle
Welcome  where souls burn
Your old wounds are opened up
The hate will flow
Like a torrential river
Destroying all the moral barriers
In the raging storm
Welcome  in the damned circle
Welcome  in a dark place
Welcome  in the damned circle
Welcome  where souls burn
Welcome my friend
In the damned circle
You have to pass the labyrinth of evil
If you want to join
Come the light in the dark
Is not the end
Just the beginning
of your nightmares
It has been you
trying to be like god
Welcome  in the damned circle
Welcome  in a dark place
Welcome  in the damned circle
Welcome  where souls burn
I'm afraid of day and night
I'm breaking in two
thousand pieces
Hands are touching me
again and again
and I can't defeat myself
Is this only a dream
Please tell me why
It's the dark side of the moon
When I see your face in black
Every night
destroying my dreams
I'm crying and try to escape
Cause the pain is unbearable
When you close
The door behind you
I stay alone with my shattered dreams
and all the pain
It's the dark side of the moon
When I see your face in black
I'm trying to walk away
But I know that
you're coming back
And it will happen in the most
Beautiful parts of my dreams
And everything will start again
And I ask you why
I'm trying to walk away
But I know that
you're coming back
It's the dark side of the moon
When I see your face in black
Can you hear my voice
It tells you that I am wrong
I will see you burning
Darkness will cover
the death of the other soul
I wait for my own requiem
Or the end of all the time
I am an angel
I am the devil inside
Feel the pain in your soul
Your sleepless nights
will be mine
The gifts I will bring to you
Fire and the dust of my dreams
Someone you have never seen before
Somewhere you have never been before
No blood is running
Through my veins
Only ice on the
river of hate
You are the only and last witness
of the murder of an angel
There is another side of heaven
determined for you
The eclipse of eternity
No blood is running
Through my veins
Only ice on the
river of hate
Days are coming
Days are vanishing
Look into my eyes do
you believe in the day
Changing all the past years
When you hold the knife into your hands
I want to feel it
I am the owner of every part
Of your thought and sense
In the mirror
Steel by your side
I can see you when
I close my eyes
In the mirror
Steel by your side
When will see you
in the other side
You are trying to
control the situation
You are aware it is over
Can you feel it
I am the air that you breathe
Your sleepless night will be mine
Tell me the truth about your own
When you see your face
on the other side
In the mirror
Steel by your side
I can see you when
I close my eyes
In the mirror
Steel by your side
When will see you
in the other side
I thought a lot about you
Longing with rage and greed
Suspending through the darkness
The earth is on flames
Lost in thoughts
in time and space
We kill the past day by day
To return into life come to me
In the distance
In my thoughts and
In my secret dreams
In the distance
In the darkness
Evil with angels skin
I have been captured
in a labyrinth of hate
Paralyzed and irritated
of your vision
The truth vanished
like a shadow in the dark
If we break the gate of eternity
We will witness the death
In the distance
In my thoughts and
In my secret dreams
In the distance
In the darkness
Evil with angels skin
Are you yearning
The events of tomorrow
Do you dream of the future
I will unite with dark forces
We disdain the death
Fighting ritual wars
Nobody understands
The sky turns red
No one can be rescued
I will unite with dark forces
When shadows fall
Death is the only fate
When shadows fall
I'm your master of hate
When darkness swallow the day
The moonlight will guide you
The name in the tombstone
will be yours
Then the painful silence
I will burn
There is no hope
You have lost yourself
The dices have tumbled
now it's time to leave
When the sun will never shine
When shadows fall
Death is the only fate
When shadows fall
I'm your master of hate
With deep scars in the heart
on the way to see heaven
Innerly torn apart forever
The look into the mirror
The evil awakening
I see the devil in my eyes
I am my worst enemy
I'm not the one you think I am
But I want to know
the taste of death
and move towards my destiny
Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in the garden of sins
Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in a twilight of despair
The blood of my enemies
and two dying doves
and a black angel will unite
Tomorrow will never end
Today will never come back again
Do you see the day
destroyed by the darkness
And move towards my destiny
Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in the garden of sins
Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in a twilight of despair
Into my lost dreams
Spend one more day
Not to resign
Spend one more day
And wait for the night
When it's over you'll find the answer
This is a dark place
Because you made it
This is a dark place
And it was your fiction
Swallowed by oblivion
This was the name of the place
I have been before
I am the evil
I see the devil in my eyes
I'm your day and night
I'm the coldness in your heart
I'm your death
Now you pray for your life
But it's too late
Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in the garden of sins
Fallen angel of eternal flame
Lost in a twilight of despair

Out of winter came a warhorse of steel
I've never killed a woman before
But I know how it feels
I know you'd have gone insane
If you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law
I met up with a stranger last night
To keep me alive
He spends all his time on gambling
And guns to survive
So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonighttonight
I know you'd have gone insane
if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law
So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonighttonight
I can laugh at the wind
I can howl at the rain
Down in the canyon or out on the plains
I know you'd have gone insane
if you saw what I saw
So now I've got to look for
Sanctuary from the law
So give me Sanctuary from the law
And I'll be alright
Just give me Sanctuary from the law
And love me tonighttonight

Priest are you there
Can you hear my voice
Do you hear my prayers
Are you out there
Forgive me priest for I have sinned
I know not what I do
Mother I am here
I can hear your song
I can feel your fear
He's done you wrong
Temptation fed his own desires
In the ring of fire
In my ring of fire tonight
I would have loved you for a thousand years
I would have died for you
I would have sacrificed it all my dear
I would have bled for you
'Til death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
Its a nice night for a black wedding
Its a nice night for a black wedding
I heard your cry and I just knew
I never meant to forsake you
Mother there's no reason to repent
You know not what you do
I heard the bells and I just knew
An angel once now a ghost of you
Deliver me from my own desires
From my ring of fire
From my ring of fire tonight
I would have loved you for a thousand years
I would have died for you
I would have sacrificed it all my dear
I would have bled for you
'Til death do us part
You were unholy right from the start

I would have bled for you
'Til death do us part
You were unholy right from the start
Its a nice night for a black wedding

Nice night for a black wedding
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Well if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin
I know where you've been
Its all been a pack of lies
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Well I remember I remember don't worry
How could I ever forget
Its the first time
The last time we ever met
But I know the reason you kept your silence up
Oh no you don't fool me
Well the hurt doesn't show
But the pain still grows
Its no stranger to you and me
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Oh Lord

This is the witching hour
I can see the way you look at me
You can't see beyond the veil
I can tell the way you run from me
I'm not your perfect fairytale
Watch me burn
Can you feel me
Watch as I turn
What do you see
And I am
Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames
Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith
This is the witching hour
This is the witching hour
Don't you see the way I look at you
I can see behind your eyes
And can't you tell the way I reach for you
I wear my halo in disguise
I watch you burn
I can feel you
I watch as you turn
What did you do
And I am
Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames
Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith
This is the witching hour
This is the witching hour
You must burn for what you have done
You must burn for what you have done
You must burn for what you've become
You must burn
Conflicted by your hurt
So let me share your pain
Convicted for my church
I was born in flames
Addicted to my fate
Watch as I devour
Convicted for my faith
This is the witching hour
This is the witching hour
This is the witching hour
This is the witching hour
Baby watch as I step into flames for you
Baby watch me combust and explode for you
Baby watch as I burn
Baby watch as I burn for you
One last time
We were on fire
A frequency of me and you
We were on fire
One flame bursting in two
We were on fire
We watched the whole world burn away
We were on fire
I was you and baby you were me
You crawled into these flames with me
So watch me dance and watch me fly for you
One last show my dear in the purple
Baby watch as I crawl
Baby watch as I crawl away from you
One last time
We were on fire
A frequency of me and you
We were on fire
One flame bursting into two
We were on fire
We watched the whole world burn away
We were on fire
I was you and baby you were me
We were on fire
A frequency of me and you
We were on fire
One flame bursting into two
We were on fire
A frequency of me and you
We were on fire
One flame bursting into two
We were on fire
We watched the whole world burn away
We were on fire
I was you and baby you were me
We were on fire
We were on fire
We were on fire
I was you and baby you were me
Crawl into these flames with me
You look to me like I'm a revelation
You wanna know if I can bring salvation
You saw a sinner saw a saint inside of me
You wanna know if I'm a friend or an enemy
I waged war in a fiery blaze
I found peace in a purple haze
Ready or not they're gonna come out and play
I can be your heavenly or I can be your hell
I can say a prayer for you or I can cast a spell
Half God Half Devil
Half God Half Devil
Half God Half Devil
Half God Half Devil
I won't pretend that I resist temptation
I think its funny when you preach damnation
Without the darkness there'd be no light in me
I waged war in a fiery blaze
I found peace in a purple haze
Ready or not they're gonna come out and play
I can be your heavenly or I can be your hell
I can say a prayer for you or I can cast a spell
Half God Half Devil
Half God Half Devil
Half God Half Devil
Half God Half Devil

I can say a prayer for you or I can cast a spell

Baby I'm sick inside
I'm definitely out of my mind
I know there's something not quite right
Disconnect system override
You're so brave from your side of the glass
And you you can't compute you can't do the math
And the the truth is you silently study me
And there are consequences that you cannot see
And you ask yourself how did I unplug
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
You say you're the cure but I smell your disease
I've figured you out like a rat in a cage
So come in tie me down try and reprogram me
You cut me up sew me back together one more time
You start to panic when you realize
You try to shut me down when you look in my eyes
No matter how hard you try to rewire me
Or psychoanalyze my psychology
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
You say you're the cure but I smell your disease
I've figured you out like a rat in a cage
You put away your needles and knives
Tell me do you feel satisfied
Did you get what you came here for
I can tell you still want more
Did you get everything you need
Are you finished watching me bleed
Did you think you could just walk away
Did you think I'd just let you leave
Maybe you didn't think I would know
Maybe you didn't think I would see
'Cause I'll never give what you want
I learned the truth a long time ago
I would die before I
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care
I've figured it out you're the rat
Baby I don't care
I don't care
Baby I don't care
I've figured it out you're the rat
The rat in the cage
You're the rat in the cage
I thank you for all the lives you've led
I thank you for every word you said
I thank you for walking away
I thank you
I thank you for the promises you broke
For always watching watching while I choke
I thank you for teaching me
Yes I thank you for your hurting
I bite down a little harder
My blades a little sharper
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
Strike back a little harder
I scream a little louder
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
I'm stronger than I ever knew
I'm strong because of you
I hit back a little louder
Fuck you a little harder
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
I thank you for the hole you dug in me
Filled it with cement sunk me in your sea
I thank you for being so obscene
I thank you
I thank you for never facing me
Swimming in the mud never coming clean
I thank you for nothing in between
Yes I thank you for leaving
I bite down a little harder
My blades a little sharper
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
Strike back a little harder
I scream a little louder
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
I'm stronger than I ever knew
I'm strong because of you
I hit back a little louder
Fuck you a little harder
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
You wanna know why I like the pain you say
I I stay positive and I I push forward ya see
I I gotta do the right thing for my family
So I smile and I say that the world is just fine
As these fucking parasites eat up my spine
So I ask you once and I ask you again
I bite down a little harder
My blades a little sharper
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
Strike back a little harder
I scream a little louder
I'm stronger than I ever knew
I'm strong because of you
I hit back a little louder
Fuck you a little harder
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
I'm stronger than I ever knew
I'm strong because of you
I hit back a little louder
Fuck you a little harder
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
My roots my roots
Run deep into the hollow
My roots my roots
What have I gone and fucked up again this time
How did I become my own demise
All these twisted little parts of me
Afraid of losing everything
So I I pulled the trigger and I fired away
I pulled the trigger and I fired away
Can you still hear my voice from afar
Your dead flowers are still hanging on my walls
I felt God when you were near
For once everything seemed so clear
You pulled the trigger and you fired away
The shot you took was overdue
Its a good thing I am made of scar tissue
Made of scar tissue
You pulled the trigger and fired away
Won't you lay your guns down
You pulled the trigger and fired away
Won't you lay your guns down
Won't you please lay your gun down
Won't you lay your guns down
Won't you lay your gun down
Lay your gun down
Won't you lay your guns down
Won't you lay your gun down
But the safety you feel is all in your head
Step down from your pulpit
Tear the veil from your eyes
And see that this is a war of attrition
No Father tear the veil from their eyes
You have fought the battle and bear the scars
And they turned you away cause youre dangerous
But look around you are not alone
You have fought the battles and bear the scars
And they turned you away because youre dangerous
But look around you are not alone
We will live forever
You cast judgment on the scars that mark them
YOU WILL BURN
Is it too much to ask for you to wake up
We live in a broken world
You threaten me with everything in your reach
Cant you see how pathetic you are
You spit in my face and you call me trash
I look into your eyes and see nothing but anger
I look into your eyes and see nothing but anger
I cant take it anymore
I cant take this anymore
In this broken home I stand
Staring at a blank wall that has been smashed in
I feel as though I am looking into a mirror
Of whats inside of me of whats inside of me
And when I think Im safe you are right behind me
Ready to strike me
Daddy
Be the dad I never had
Be the dad I never had
In this broken home I stand
Staring at a blank wall that has been smashed in
I feel as though I am looking into a mirror
Of whats inside of me of whats inside of me
Your hates inside my head
Your hates inside my head
The hatred that I feel
Is born within this shell
The only redemption I have
Dwells within
I was born with a gun to my head
The chambers loaded and theres nowhere to run
Bullets forged by a malcontent cycle of life
Ive disfigured all within thats beautiful
Where is my sanity
Where is my sanity
Running circles trapped inside a cage
Will you release me
Oh God release me
I was born with a gun to my head
I was born with a gun to my head
I was born with a gun to my head
The chambers loaded and the time has come
Some people are born into tragedy
I need to find a way out of this hell
Is this an oppression of the mind
Or maybe its something else
I feel you creeping upon me
Your claws digging deep in my skull
I will fight
I will fight
He sends his demons in disguise
But we will not be deceived
They tear at our mind
But we will rip out their throats
Im losing grip
Where is my sanity
I was walking down a darkened stairway
I have never seen this place before
Rooms sealed by iron doors
Behind them lay unspeakable horrors
The lay inside the fire
Their homes inside the fire
They lay inside the fire
All hope is lost
Hanging from a hook like butchered flesh
He is lost forever lost
Walking down this darkened stairway
I have never seen this place before
Rooms sealed by iron doors
Behind them lay unspeakable horrors
All hope is lost
They lay inside the fire
Their homes inside the fire
Dont make your home inside the fire
For reasons I do not know
I was shown all these despicable images
Rooms sealed by iron doors
Behind them lay unspeakable horrors
Father take my eyes and hold them to the fire
Cauterize burn the flesh and make me whole again
Once again I throw myself onto shards of glass
Just leave me on the ground
I will just do it again for I am the destroyer
I am the catalyst you will offer me a way out
I am the destroyer I am the catalyst
Cauterize burn the flesh and make me whole again
ITS TOO LATE I will never survive
THE CANCER HAS TAKEN ITS HOLD ON ME
I am the cancer I am the cancer
I AM THE CANCER
And behold there was a great earthquake
And the sun became black as night
And the moon became like blood
A great star fell from heaven
Burning like a torch
Destroying a third of the waters
Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
Fall
Destroy everything
Crush the earth
Turn the oceans to blood
Let me tell you a tale of a time
When the world was veiled by darkness
Your children played in the streets like rats
And I stood by and watched them decay
Mankind is such a filthy disease
A plague upon the earth
And found myself disgusted
Let me turn back the hands of time
You may not like what you will find
This will go on and on
And on and on and on and on
You are a plague upon the earth
Wretched and vile
Wars lies death and hate
The earth has seen over 100 billion burials
We all have looked upon the faces of broken men
There is despair in every generation
We watch our children die
So tell me demon what are you trying to prove
There is a line that I will never cross
All of the evil that you are showing me
Will not break my faith
Let me tell you a tale of a time
When the world was veiled by darkness
Your children played in the streets like rats
And I stood by and watched them decay
Slither on the ground like a snake
Slither on the ground like a snake
Be gone from me
You will never get the best of me
My feet are planted on solid ground
You will never shake my faith
Yours was a soul that shined so bright
Now tainted and darkened
By anothers bitterness
By anothers bitterness
Now youre gone
Now youre gone
You were lead away by a sirens song
Led away from a place that was made for you
He closed your eyes and darkened your world
You are dead
You are dead
Time is running out
You are dead
Dead and gone
He closed your eyes and darkened your world
I cant bring you back
I cant bring you back
The world is dead
Youve corrupted all
And I will not stand by
To watch you condemn all
The world is dead
There you sit upon your pedestal
Built upon the souls you corrupted
With hate laced into the Word of God
Lucifer is calling you home
Your vile words mean nothing to me
You will not infect my heart with hate
And that youll become everything you despise
Now youve fallen
How does it feel to be on the receiving end
All the lives youve torn apart
Your vile words mean nothing to me
You will fall
You will fall
You will fall
You will fall
Your time will come you will be judged
Your time will come you will be judged
God will rip you from your pedestal
Lying here on my final day
I watched as the sky cracks open burning red
I know I should turn away but it beckons me
So into the forest I tread
Running through this forest endless and dark
Without a path to guide my way out
They told me I would never make it out alive
Now I lay here in a shrouded meadow
The mist trailing across my skin
Silently I watch as the forest closes in
And hold me fast
Silent voices whisper from the shadows
And for escape I gave it willingly
I DESCEND
Then their hands burst forth from the ground
Reeking of death
Grasping possessing
They pull me down
You must have me confused
Drop this onelike a bombshell
DON'T FORGET
All your friends back home
We adore you 
you put this in the wrong hands
Please come home 
What made you run
You put this distance between us both
Who made you think 
That these miles will bring you home
I'll be your peace when you need distraction
When the distance Starts grabing hold of you
I'll take this in my own hand 
Grab your shit
Lets get you back to your real home for good
I hate this distance between us
What made you leave in the first place
Lend me your ears
I can't wait t'get you back to California
Live inside that dream whereyou never left town
I'll be your peace when you need distraction
This is the way t'say I LOVE YOU BOTH
PLEASE come back home
They'll never love you like i do
Friends are the family you choose yourself
I can't wait t'get you back to California
Live inside that dream whereyou never left town
I'll be your peace when you need distraction
THAT GIRL
I hear her voice from across the room
I see her body up close
Her sweat feels just like venom
I hope your boyfriend will never know
All things I wanna do to her
I trace the curves of her body
With my fingertips
We'll spend our lives in the bedroom
Were gonna lock all the doors
She is the ghost of my hallways
My fingers tracing her movements
We slept
In the same tiny bed
I covered all her corners
With my hands
I love to feel her on my skin
I love her sweat on my body
I am a secret she wants to keep
Folded in laundry
Tucked in the sheets
I love her body in my control
I love to feel her on my skin
She is my favorite Friday night
Shes got more curves than a canyon road
She calls
When she wants something evil
Im glad to give her just what she needs
Take her straight to the bedroom floor
She stares at me with those bedroom eyes
BEDROOM EYES
BEDROOM EYES
We'll spend our lives in the bedroom
Were gonna lock all the doors
She is the ghost of my hallways
My fingers tracing her movements
Nobody panic here
I've seen their footsteps at my door
Show me evidence show me what you b'lieve
I've got a plan where nobody needs you
I'll leave your body on a trail so no one knows
How t'find you
They got a way t'hold my feet down
They want t'follow in my broken footsteps
They've come to break my stride and vision
They got a clever way t'chain me t'the ground
They always get too close
they come along and ruin everything
Digging deeper into my skin Let my mind expire
I'll build a fire and put it b'neath you
I'll take a picture and I'll remind everyone
Where t'find you
They want t'watch me feel my heart stop beating
Dear intruders come find me at that line
This has to end t'day
Dear intruders start running for cover quick
This has to end today
Just send them all away
Send them my waytime keeps moving
Without looking for a fight
Dear intruders start running for cover quick
This has to end t'day
Digging deeper into my skin
Let my mind expire
I'll build a fire and put it b'neath you
Rumors and Reputations
Get the most of your time
I love to hear these words
I'm waiting for the echo
My favorite timeless sound
Stories told are nothing like the truth
Too many keys Too many doors
Take me away from all of this bullshit
I love t'hear your words
When you seek your apologies
I'm waiting for the echo
My favorite timeless sound
Stories told are nothing like the truth
Too many keys Too many doors
I'm getting off the bullshit
Too many keys I'm getting off the bullshit
Too many keys too many doors
Too many keys too many doors
I'm getting off the bullshit
Too many keys too many doors
Waiting for the echo
My favorite timeless sound
Stories told are nothing like the truth
Too many keys too many doors
Too many keystoo many doors
We walk these roads a mile at a time
We took it apart but got there fine
They're lying t'me when I'm behind the wheel
They take my arms and drag me through the mud
The power to create The power to destroy
Time was nonexistant
The distance between us grows so thin
Running in circles we drew ourselves
Pick your battles before you go to war
We constructed these monuments from stone
Before I go let me remind you i was here
I helped you poor the water into the seven seas
You helped me plant the trees
We taught ourselves t'breathe
Where did you go Creators of the skies
We waited so long to call this home
I'm dying to leave
This world was all we knew
They take my arms and drag me through the mud
so polluted
Wastelands remind me of what I've got t'do
Before it's gone let me remind you why i came
You left us all alone
You've got yourself to blame
I helped you poor the water into the seven seas
You left us all alone
You've got yourself to blame
Everybody's moving
In double time in the same direction
Is anybody listeniiiing
To the cries of the fallen
One foot in front of the last one
Our only choice is to pray and hold on
I see the pain in their eyes
it's starting to make my stomach turn
I hope we live through tonight
The fear and the filth go hand in hand
We found ourselves in hell
they'll never take my mind
This is a promise i made to myself
Another day in the wastelands
I'm staring at the stars
The only way of pretending it's a dream
I'll keep my weapon near me
Just in case the enemy is
looking for some trouble
They aim and fire upon us
they're never going to surrender
We're gonna push them one by one
here they come by the thousands
Hold your fire wait till' they're close
Take aim shoot until they all lay lifeless
The only good ones are dead ones
Give them just what they came for
Lay their bodies to waste
I hope we live through tonight
The fear and the filth go hand in hand
Don't leave me wasted
I've got so much to tell when i come back home
I took a chance to be abnormal
This is a promise i made to myself
We are the only survivors
We made a family of strangers
Time is standing still
We are a sound of melody combined
Living in this moment
A wall of sound made from different voices
we know the words we sing so softly
When i call for safety I'll keep this near me
I'll keep waiting
Well remind them what we live for
No one can take this away from me
We will always have what we're proud of
No one can take this
SIT DOWN
Never sit when you can STAND UP
GET DOWN
Never crawl when you can LAY DOWN
Never stay awake
When you can sleep it off
There's always a next time
Grab the moment beforeit's gone for good
You can't have it all
If you don't go take it
Someone else is
Trying to steal it from you
Times up
None of your stories make you famous
Show me
Give everything you have
Prove t'me your going to claim it
you can't shake hands with a closed fist
OH
Never stay awake
When you can sleep it off
There's always a next time
Grab the moment before it's gone for good
Sit down
Never sit when you can STAND UP
Get down
Never crawl when you can
STAND ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET
Show me
None of your stories make you famous
Get down
Give everything you have
Stand on your own two feet
Get out
You're always playing the victim
Before you know it it comes back quick
Don't call it a reason
I'll bring this all to an end
I pray this sword t'be swift
Call me the bearer of bad news
Call me this angel t'save you from yourself
I'm staring straight to the serpent's eye
Here comes a cave in
I'll tear it down brick by brick
I will show you just what you did
Call me baby when you calm back down
I'll be waiting by your bedroom door
Looking forward to the poison's new home
Can't you see what we've lost
And this is never your show
I know you'll never believe me
But baby it just go's on t'show
Now I'm starting to believe
I've got this poison in my veins
They filled me with concrete
If i were you I'd be gone
So is it me or my sudden grief
I paint a picture and you throw it in my face
Just cover your tracks when you ditch us
Don't ever say
I wasn't there t'help you
As the world opens up to swallow
I'll cut my losses
Everyday another foot in the grave
Another peice is falling from this broken heart
You built a wall of excuses
I watched you put them all here
brick by brick
Last night i woke up from this dream
I lay dissapointed
Nothing can compare t'what I've seen
There is another place for me
There's no point in waking up from a good dream
Somebody save me
There's never enough here for me
I'm going back t'sleep
Nobody wake me
Reality is such a nightmare
I'm gonna close my eyes
Live here inside this dream
I've always been a dreamer
I do it for myself
I've been to paradise and back
I've seen so many fucking colors
God Damn
That place was beautiful
I'm looking straight in from the world
There's no point in waking up from a good dream
There's never enough here for me
I'm going back t'sleep
I'm going back t'sleep
From the moment that i wake up I'll be thinking
There's nothing i can't do while I'm dreaming
DON'T
Don't take it all so seriously
I'm going back t'sleep
Never wake me up
I'm always dreaming
NEVER WAKE ME UP
I've got a problem
I've gotta get some
The real world is gone
I've gotta keep sane
Did you call just to lie while your leaving
I'm the reason you die I'm with you
You made such a big mistake
Your covered with them lies that you told
I've gotta keep moving I hate what you did
I can't kill the past
On the blackest of nights
while your bleeding
I'm the reason you die I'm with you
Just tell me something
I don't know our ending
You live your life by the book
You went and planned out the garden of secret
You think your so fucking clever
Did you call just to lie about leaving
I'm the reason you die I'm with you
I'm going back to sleep
This world behind my eyes is what i seek
Please stay away from me
Leave all my troubles behind in the real world
I'm gaining nothing from this hurting
Don't cry when you find me rested
I'll be lost in a dream where its painless
Keep my memory among the good ones
Don't cry when you find me rested
I'll be lost in a dream where it's painless
Keep my memory among the good ones
If i could run
Somewhere off in the darkness I'd be fine
Crawl to safety
Take away the good things i have left
I love all the pulse that beats my heart
Here in my coma
I get to choose whats real and whats fake
I can't accept this
Here in my coma
I get to choose whats real and whats fake
They left without me they're gone too soon
A part of me can never feel safety
If this is real
I'll wear the date across my chest
Why is it me
that has t'bury his best friendand continue
Somebody chose me
Let it out let it all come t'me
Leave everybody with no sense of time
Suffocating like I've never been breathing
Why is it me
who gets to live while they get death
Enjoy your castles in
THE SKY
If this is real
I'll wear the date across my chest
Why is it me
Why is it me
A mind is a state of being
Stay the Fuck outa my mind and my being
I dont fault the police
I dont fault the police
Cause the people that run um divide and deseace
Run around with a badge and a gun

And it all comes down to this
That a pig is a pig is a pig is a pig
Cuz I don't need this body
I see the line traced back to my ancestors
And I hold on tight to that line
I piss on your Jesus I shit on your Mary
These are the crosses my ancestors carry
So I piss on your Jesus I shit on your Mary
Tow the line follow me blind
Let Jesus carry you home
Believe in love from our God above
Or we'll beat you to the bone
Corporate Avenger Motherfucker Disfunction
Eyes of the higher desire my own faith
See I'm joined with the mothership others trip
It don't distract me where do I stand exactly
You're wack if you have to ask me
Choose Slang sanctuary prepare for brain change
Whirlwinds'll instill worlds turning
You label me an enemy I'm proud to be and Indian
You labeled me an enemy
It is a plant not a demon
It is a teacher it is a healer
Roots within our mother's skin
One who gives freely
Who are you so full of lies
I am human I'm alive
Who are you to dictate rights
What you see is not our sight
Who are you so full of lies
I am human I'm alive
Who are you to dictate rights
What you see is not our sight
A mind full of lies is a liars mind
We moved ahead and left the truth behind
There's blood from sea to shining sea
A stolen land from you and me
Hitler's Nazi Germany
A divine dream of suffering
Andrew Jackson made his plea
Removal of the Cherokee
If Hitler was on the 20 dollar bill
How would the Jews feel
Trail of tears
Hawaii for Hawaiians
Black Hills for the Sioux
A stolen land for me for you
You think it ain't going on today
You pass a twenty look the other way
Desecration of a burial site
Did you go shopping at the mall tonight
The blood is on the Christains' hands
With crosses they possessed this land
Crimes against humanity
A stolen land for you and me
Can you discover what's already there
By definition you become aware
The greatest country in the history of man
Was here long before the colonies began
Ownership of a land a lie
Soliders marched and children died
Small pox blankets for thier heads
Jackson killed the children dead
Chaos in a world of shattered souls and
False believes encouraging a fading hope
Keep the world in a suffocating grasp
Incompetent humanity  a mindless mass
Take your life and die but you cannot escape
Death is always the answer to your prayers
No matter what the question might be
Despair is a feeling you share
With all those who too care
Resulting in deadly and bleeding nightmares
I feel no hope I hear no prayers
Has god forsaken this world
Why are we here when does this end
An empty future is this worth still fighting for
Out  running in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out killing on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out  bombing from the skies
A thousand more will die
You take so many lives
Now its time to stand and fight
Now the war is a beginning to the end
Thoughtless self destruction
If you worship your gods and do as they command
Then nothing is left to be
Shoot to kill or shoot to live
It does not matter now 'cause
Death is stalking  hell is calling
The terror in your eyes defines your life
Out  running in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out killing on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out  bombing from the skies
A thousand more will die
You take so many lives
Now it's time to stand and fight
Order from chaos and shattered souls
Shot to die and left alone
Hordes of soldiers march to kill
No one cares about human will
You did nothing and stepped aside
You let the slaughter take place tonight
Why did you do this
Where will you run to now
I can't take this I cant take this any
I can't take this I can't take this anymore
Out  running in the fields
The fighting has begun
Out killing on the streets
They're falling one by one
Out  bombing from the skies
A thousand more will die
You take so many lives
Now its time to stand and fight
In the night when the hordes come out
A whole new world is born from pain
Shredding light and destroying what's good
A graceful mist of pure darkness
Tearing the souls of greater men
These wicked creations stand proud
Leading the way for those who follow
A blackened star for children of evil
It doesn't matter if we stand alone
It doesn't matter if we die
Still we will reign in terror and fear
Just as long as you keep us in your mind
Pestilence annihilation pestilence in your head
Shining in the dark and always victorious
Living in the shadows though we are glorious
We do not exist and yet we are here
We do not exist and still we are feared
Exterminate  wherever you go
Exterminate  we're coming for you
Exterminate  prepare for attack
Exterminate  no turning back
Pestilence annihilation pestilence in your head
Trapped in hell  now die
Death by terror  don't close your eyes
'cause the nightmares have just begun
Look into your deepest of thoughts
We will haunt you no matter what
When the hunt is over and its time to execute
You'll know that death has arrived
Stare into our eyes and take your life
Finally you decide to die
Pestilence annihilation pestilence in your head
Were you supposed to die tonight we don't know
Few days left and they would have let you go
Why did you take the choice you made
I wonder if there could have been another way
Still remembered though you're gone and
In our hearts all the memories live on
Time won't change what we feel
Forever missed and nothing ever heals
It starts with the nature of the human race
As cryptic phantom symptoms
All dwelling in the thinnest veins but
Nothing can reveal the course for this pain
Vascular system infected by bacteria
Due to leucopenia caused by Zotepine
Rubor Dolor Calor Tumor
Inflammation causing me to die
Inject the meds into my blood
Purify my inner thoughts
Running through my veins
Do it again I must
To cleanse my blood
Infected is my system now a system of decay
Functio lesa paralysis toxic venom
Constant spreading through my veins
Central nervous system is shutting down
It's a needle penetrating the main artery
Delivering pure life in the form of penicillin
Now I'm healed oh so healed
But it's only until it starts again
Now the fight is on to be
Hanging in there but
There seems to be no hope for me
All is gone  nothing left
Except for one final crucial test
Please medicate my soul
Of a corpus oh so weak
Inject the meds into my blood stream
At last my system is recovering from
Severe intoxication and from decontaminating
Biological warfare is saving all of me
Though my mind is scarred for life
I am grateful I survived so now it's time
To leave this hospital for good
And to live the life I want
Not fearing what is in my blood
I want it all  I don't care what it may cost
born from pain and fire
Direct descend of hell
Born from pain and fire
Where the flames are burning well
Follow the misery
Kill all  leave none to be
Reign now control the land
Justice by your hand
Only the dead have seen the end of war
Roam throughout the land
Lead by the darkest of commands kill'em all
Believe us to be heroes
In a war so meaningless
Terror knows no glory
Stop and do not pretend
All of our lives we search
And by death of others we know
This pitiful life is cursed
To the blackest of ends I must go
Only the dead have seen the end of war
Roam throughout the land
Lead by the darkest of commands kill'em all
Fighting all the wars all alone and on your own
Lurking in the kindergarten
Shooting at everyone firing at will
Night's destruction
And I have lived a thousand years and
Only seen life disappear from this world
As the sun it brightly rose
I walked across the entire globe
Saw all the scars from the human claws
These open wounds will never be gone
And at night I was embraced by light
Feeling the stars strength and might
Coming from above in this cold forsaken world
I turned to god and yelled in my deepest despair
Awaken in the darkest night
A freezing sky  a warming light
I see my breath as I exhale
I see it all  I see so clear
But alone I lay on plains of ice
Hoping that I soon will die
You see those tears of mine are shades
Of black that never fade away  fade away
Shades of black as light in dark
Heal my mind and ease my heart
Semper fidelis  I will never forget
Reminding me of the life we once lived
Free my sorrow  free my soul
The rain is gone  you made me whole
The shades of black are here at night
With a glowing hope as the moons dim light
All shades of black illuminate my path and
Keep me safe as you guide me on my way
Now please bring me home
Now I stand a different man
I've lived and died but still I am
On my back in frost white grass
A second away from shadows of past
I've wandered the entire globe in a
Single thought I've gained new hope
Got through it all and now I live
My eternal love is forever missed
So shine a light and shine it strong
Shine a light for my day has come
All life is just borrowed and one day
We will have to give it back  give back
Trace of terror  it is time
Trace of terror  left behind
Leave this world  on your own
Leave this world  never alone
The battlefield seems so far away
Nothing can stop you or block your way
Certain in your mind you rest your case
For the greater good and for the human race
Cold eyes reflects a life time of sadness
A life of despair from broken souls
Always remember the pain which you bear
Wherever you go I will follow you
Trace of terror  what is the course
Trace of terror  is it yours
Leave this world  you've got nothing left
Leave this world  leave their death
Do not obey the orders you take
Deny their rules and turn away
Your life is our own  remember this
Just walk the line  here's nothing you will miss
Shot down in cold blood  you tried to run away
You tried to prevent a tragedy
These revelations all came to you too late
The deed is now done  nothing can be changed
All is pitch black and my pain has gone away
Still I see clear as it was in the day
Embraced at night by the shadows of a tear
Hell awaits my life  I die without fear
Hellshock terror all across the front
Scared to death you run with your gun
The enemy is near as you take your aim
Shoot to kill so you don't die in vain
Cut till the day your second son's blown away
Where is your honour where is your faith
You've got your orders and you do what you must
Lost in violence  why am I
Lost in violence  ready to die
Forward over the graves I march without fear
The battle is on  I now see death clear
Trapped in the downfall of eternity's might
Believed in the shades of angels light
I now know what I should have done
And what I've could have changed
In my fight I've realized that I've already lost
I can only hope to get redemption by my god
Lost in violence why am I
Lost in violence  ready to die
Run for your life
Darkness closing in
Satan screams behind
Winds of death
Destined to
Angels from above
Scarred true wings of pain
Salvation lies ahead
Grab their hands
Can't reach out
Destined to die
Will to live enforced by my strength to fight
Unlimited power to arise
I have only darkness and blood in mind
Light my path so I may lead the way
I will show the weak what we must change
True evil is indifference in good men
As I embrace their fears it all begins
I've searched the corners of
The world to find a reason why
But all I found was death and hate
How come I missed the light
I stand by the deeds I've done
And prepare to live my life
My finest hour smiles at
Me as I drift into the night
Lost in violence  why am I
Lost in violence  ready to die
Fighting forever for human cruelty
Holocaust on battlefields is my specialty
I decide millions of fates
And in my trench hole certain death awaits
Now you march forward to die
Feel now the hatred come alive
Full metal jackets of death in the air
Piercing the helmets of privates with fear
Endless killing endless death
Machine gun fire in the night
Fight to live
Fight to serve
Fight to win
Fight to die
Fight to feel
Fight to kill
Storming up in a frontal attack
The killing is on  there's no turning back
All I see is blitz in the night
The blasts of bombs and painfilled cries
Running under an allseeing eye
Lighting green and lighting in the skies
Time to shoot  kill
Endless killing endless death
Machine gun fire in the night
Fight to live
Fight to serve
Fight to win
Fight to die
Fight to feel
Fight to kill
Every man for himself  shot you in the head
Nothing ever last and neither did your life
Prepare for total war as you step into the night
Blackest of night in your mind
Darkness fills your eyes tonight
Black knights of death
Are marching forward to take your life
Darkness descends
An everlasting war to terminate the saintly
Destruction of the world
From the heart of darkness
und verbreitet ihres Leid
isch no lang nid satt
A storm is coming the wind is near
Why we have so much to fear
Please tell me now this ancient story
of death and lies of unholy glory
Black shadows and black horses
About the green hunter out of hell
Of mighty and evil the legacy of an ancient tale
A journey through the deepest dark
Talking about after bend
Time and country is so hard
I'm gonna die to at the end 
Ig wiu nech jetzt die Gschicht verzene
im ÃÂÃÂmmitan do ischs passiert 
Tod u vergÃÂÃÂ¤utig uf der WÃÂÃÂ¤ut
Ig wiu nech jetzt die Gschicht verzene
im ÃÂÃÂmmitan do ischs passiert 
d Seeu verchouft u nid fÃÂÃÂ¼r GÃÂÃÂ¤ut
This mysterious place 
far beyond my imagination
Waits a tale of the real me
In this darkness you're alone
Will you die or will you go
Dert i dÃÂÃÂ¤m Tau dert wirsch es xseh 
es urauts Huus keni Bewohner me
e schwarze Pfoschte z mitts ir Muur 
e Zapfe drinne vomne muetige Buur
U loh mi do lo wohne nÃÂÃÂ¤bem Wasser im Tau
aus hie blibe u z si schunnt dr Chummer nie me
Near by us there is a church
They're waiting for all they're waiting for her
They're waiting for the birth of this child
to spread the holy water as a shield of light
Defenders of all evil at the night 
For faith and glory for life and for
Fight and live longer fight 
this water makes stronger
Against the evil against the night
The lord is suddenly greedy and tyrannical
Cursed and damned everything he encounters
Bad and mighty sad and evil
Hail for this water hail for the king 
Hail for these mountains hail for this ring
For the good and the brave of this land
For the people here where I stand
Heiligs Wasser dert i dÃÂÃÂ¤m Tal 
beschÃÂÃÂ¼tzisch ÃÂÃÂ¼s vor so mangem Fau
vor Herrscher u Tyranne mit viu GÃÂÃÂ¤ud
The sun is shining this year too bright
And you shall be my trees
Plants on the way into my castle
You do not have time more
If you will not make it in this short time
Have mercy on you gods
Erwartet keni Gnade wes nid lÃÂÃÂ¤ngt ir Zyt
It needs a miracle it takes more time
Who will help us now in this hard time
We want to die we will flee
and are afraid of the Kings words
The peasants sit under a tree and could
Not believe the whole story
When suddenly a man came out of the nothing
and wanted to know what they have
A hunter green with green robe 
Red hair and red beard
A red feather in his hat
I can help you dear friends of faith
But you have to promise me an unbaptized child
The trees I'll get you in this time
This child is the only thing I desire
Und mir schwÃÂÃÂ¶re dert im Maimond
ungerem Boum e grusige Schwur
Und mir verchofe ÃÂÃÂ¼si Seele 
am ne Ma im ne grÃÂÃÂ¼ene Huet
Black horse of the fire of fire and pain
By wind and the storm through fog and the rain
They arrive at their destination
Dir werdet mi ir Nacht doch xseh 
Cursed by the hunter who oversees the entire 
Suddenly there appear more trees
In a row they stand side by side
As if they had always been there
Dunkli Schatte gÃÂÃÂ¤ng wie me 
We feel the joy and shout out loud
But soon we forget that we have made promise
A newborn child we will never give to him
We hope he will have forgotten it by now
u au ziehts mit i ihre Bann
Sogar dÃÂÃÂ¼r schtotzigi FÃÂÃÂ¤uder
With a kiss on the check they seal their promise
The secret they won't tell anyone
Verlore ir dunkleschte Nacht irgendwo
Wartet sie uf die Macht
Wo seit ihres Ching sÃÂÃÂ¶tti zue ihm cho
Dreckig u lut het ÃÂÃÂ¤r glacht
But the girl's belly grew and grew
Now it's time to raise the swords
We don't give a child to the devil
Dr Pakt mit em TÃÂÃÂ¼fu het sie gmacht
Ir dÃÂÃÂ¶fschte und dunkelste Voumondnacht
ÃÂÃÂr het sie umgange und umworbe
am beschte wÃÂÃÂ¤r sie denn grad gschtorbe
grad gschtorbe
DÃÂÃÂ¤nke u nÃÂÃÂ¤r de KÃÂÃÂ¤mpfe 
Liebe u nÃÂÃÂ¤r de chrige

Handle u nÃÂÃÂ¤r verwandle
WÃÂÃÂ¼sse u nÃÂÃÂ¤r de kÃÂÃÂ¼sse
Pain in me is getting stronger and stronger
But the will is in me no longer no longer
My life is now quickly departing me
But I feel just now what we have done
The green hunter we lied to 
The green hunter we lied to
Close around me many of my friends die
Children and women and even all the animals
May you rest in peace may you rest in peace
We would have listened to your words
Then all this would not have happened
The Beast in me is what I hate 
The Beast in me is what I hate 
Schwarzi Chlaue wie dr Tod
Es frisst sich dÃÂÃÂ¼r Hut und Fleisch
bis nimm weisch wo du jetzt schteisch
u wartet bis z HÃÂÃÂ¤rz schtiuschtoht
denn lÃÂÃÂ¤be duets vo aunes Tod
Like a cloud in the wind dark an evil 
No living creature on this earth
Our swords cannot help us now
The end is drawing nearer
isch nid was mir wei
Sie schlicht umhÃÂÃÂ¤r still und wie gift 
Sie verbreitet sich wie dr Wind
Zieht aus mit i sicher Tod 
Tier und d LÃÂÃÂ¼t u sogar no d Ching
sie sterbe e ganz gruusige Tod 
vou SchmÃÂÃÂ¤rze und vou Leid
bis ke lebÃÂÃÂ¤nidigi Kreatur me zieht 
verteilt sie ihres Chleid
ÃÂÃÂ¤r hets gmacht ÃÂÃÂ¤ndlech gmacht
Ig wott sterbe ig wott wÃÂÃÂ¤rde
und mir si liebe wis frÃÂÃÂ¼echer isch xsii
A warrior whose heart was crying 
The whole thing end the whole thing end
He waited for the beast in the hidden room
Although he must pay with his death
Pay with his death pay with his death
Verschliesses ganz Fescht das isch dr letscht
erscht u letscht versuech wo ig ha
Here ends the story that will be told 
the evil can always be defeated
But the devil will always be in our dreams 
fight and die with your sword
The time will come will come again 
get ready for new battlefields
We fight until we win again 
over and over and over again
We fight until we win again 
over and over and over again
We fight until we win again 
over and over and over again
We fight until we win again
in this world of Misanthropy
Fuck Humanity
Hundreds of masses of misery
Sodomized the whore reality
I hate every kind of God
Religion followed by sheeps or not
I am a Nihilist inside you
This is life miserable fool
Fornication Drugs Trafficking Cancerous diseases
 this is you deserve in your fucking world
This is the beginning of the end 
Mother Nature decomposes tones of flesh
world in which no one breathes
respect to the planet Earth 
I hate every kind of God
Religion followed by sheeps or not
I am a Nihilist inside you
This is life miserable fool
All Bodies shall bathe in the Vomit of creation
Messiah For Parasites
Let Them Rot
Suicide Master
Cut Your Flesh
Creation Of Mankind
Feed With Poison Your Pathetic Lives
Another heart days perforates the slander
Another time look up to the renegade
Despise the bastard exclude or isolate
Wake up and lift your masquerade
Welcome to the ball of thousand faces
Welcome to the world of the prejudiced
Your presentday it's never too late
Woke up and lift your masquerade
To the end of the millennium
Seek refuge with safety
Your contempt doesn't follow me
To a star with dignity
Present an example of impartiality
Us living in a kingdom with lack of concern
Gore the harm of human kind
Satan governs you beside
See the world with different eyes
Some see the truth and some the lies
Observe the darkness and the light
From the cage of iron times
Prisoned on a metal star
Progress comes where human beings are
Live together in a cage of time
Defend against all throes of death
Our time is coming closer
Indication outer space
The orbit is instable
All achievements are in blaze
Unfold oneself oneself regress
Cycle rules we must confess
Cannot resist against the
Cage of time
Defect a sign
Facts of the case are inhuman
Desperate act moments of madness predominate
No one's the judgement of pleasure and pain
No execution no killer no beast need this system
Is it just a dream a fantasy
Or maleficent reality
In a good state of mind
You pay the price
The executor rolls the dice
You're tearing us apart
Time will never change
Entomb the rest of my soul alive
Don't forget you pay a high price
Death row opens the gates
Ohoho a question of conscience
Pull out all the stops to safe my life
Ohoho reprisal not prevent
The sadness to your end
With a poor sense of direction
You follow the keepers
To the last station
Of your protracted
Trials and tribulations
A short prayer
The feed the cold metal cuffs
The executor closes the circuit
See you in hell
Be ruined in the ocean
Drag along a dozen events of a prehistoric time
A kingdom unmolested
In noon the sun is in zenith abandoned in a
Scene of dreams be engaged in something
Perhaps a pungent atmosphere a little scare
A little fear failure of doom see the truth
Kingdom of the damned
Reincarnate
A legend or a lie
The myth never dies
Revelation guides the final round
Plead to the folls kneel on the ground
Fear will come closer
A tidal wave the land is torn
The combat's lost a legend's born
The truth of presume inundated
Everlasting evermore
Monotonous daily life before
Think about the evolution of machines
Most are useful some cruel and mean
They erase all bad souls
Like ticking time bombs
Take control
They escort us to eternity
Mankind seems defeated
Expired by technology
I feel the control by a new machine
Every night the stars are bright
No train of thoughts a quiet course
The moonset shine a cold wind blows
But every day the progress grows
They erase all souls and take control
You catch the side of his second face
Envy and hate sadden your mind
Carry all the consequences
You are standing on the edge
My confirmed ignorance
For your desperate revenge
If brothers or sisters acquittance
And relations will always
Stand with you in a place
Maybe you discover as insidious
Carry all the consequences
You are standing on the edge
My confirmed ignorance
For your desperate revenge
Desire is raging like the storm treats the sea
Rise as high as the sun veneration began
My heartblood is freezing
When the nights surrounding me
My flesh and blood longs to stray
Just hesitate when time melts away
Among the light I run and chase
Hurting words abashed this place
Injustice drawn seems so real
Stand for your right and be a man
Don't suppress all that you can
That's the pride of the mourner
Lonely in the sense of time
Kneeling depressed
In front of the shrine
I'll be waiting for a sign
Dark prediction from a hill
I believe with iron will
Always lose both there's a time
I'm gonna get you
Betray your race thoughtless
Descent of your kind
I'm a witness of a nave
Space and time
Beware of the justice
I believe and have no doubt
Your mercy for today
Is not allowed
It's hard to understand
Your deception
Confide my secrets to you
Chemical chain reaction
Perhaps freak out too
Deepening of healthy visions
Poised stand of your bust
The gratitude to the end
Breach of some one's trust
Many times where I don't
Know what I am
Reduce me to reality
Like a heavy rock in the surf
Thoughts surround my brain
Back to the ground of facts
What has happened to me
Indistinct intolerant impenetrable
Are the walls of my thoughts
Satan's tears inflamed the cry
Between my thoughts
And the dark side
Try to toil and catch the light
My dive stopped
Returns my pride
One step forward
With the experience attack
Now I'm back and alive
Self assured resolved
I can break the walls
Of my thoughts
I don't leave a trace in the sand
I never breathe the air that you spend
Beyond the walls of cold denial
I'm watching you in dust and time
Down there among the ruined bridge
I wait for you to come
Flames of the past burning strong
My journey has come to an end
As I drown in the rivers of oblivion
It's the destiny that takes
Our masks away
Down there among
The ruined bridge
I wait for you to come
Down there
I'm waiting for you
I'll wait forevermore
I'm still there
When you are gone
Woe Woe Woe unto mankind
Woe Woe World in flames
Woe Woe Woe unto humanity
Woe Woe Ah Trumpets of doom
Ah Trumpets of doom
Ah Trumpets of doom
Ah Trumpets of doom
Ah Trumpets of doom
False god on heavens throne
Horned ruler  divide and rule
Under your wings  angels of death
Soulless demons executors of your cruel will
Woe Woe Woe unto mankind
Woe Woe World in flames
Woe Woe Woe unto humanity
Woe Woe Ah Trumpets of doom
Ah Trumpets of doom
Ah Trumpets of doom
Ah Trumpets of doom
Ah Trumpets of doom
When the hope dies
When the illusion fades
When the faith ends
United in a sea of blood
United in a sea of blood
United in a sea of blood
False god on heavens throne
Horned ruler  divide and rule
Under your wings  angels of death
Soulless demons executors of your cruel will
Another day
A wasted day
And I don't have an alibi
I spend my time
In stupid rites
To find a reason for my life
There ain't a chance
A fucking chance
To be a different one to me
There ain't a chance
I've always failed
It's just an endless fall
I am asking to my senses
The reason for I am going down
I am looking for the traces
Of an endless sleep
Nobody wants to hear me
Nobody wants to same me now
I need chance to runaway
Over my useless life
I'd need to pray
But I won't pray
I am too tired to receive a sign
Another time
In futile rites
My eyes are empty I guess I'm blind
There ain't a chance
A fucking chance
To be a different one to me
There ain't a chance
I've always failed
It's just a costant fall
I am asking to my senses
The reason for I am going down
I am looking for the traces
Of an endless sleep
Nobody wants to hear me
Nobody wants to save me now
I need a chance to runaway
Over my useless life
There ain't a chance
A fucking chance
To be a different one to me
There ain't a chance
I've always failed
It's just an endless fall
Over my useless life
I don't think it's necessary
To show my inner state
I don't think you're necessary
To save me from this gorge
To follow to the other side
Where I'll kill my self
I'm running through the burning fields
Of my lonely darkest days
I'm feeling lost inside the frame
Of my lonely darkest days
I don't need this life
I've buried beneath my withered heart
And don't you try to tell your fairy
Tales so don't you try
To give me all your beaming light
I've lost inside me
I'm running through the burning fields
Of my lonely darkest days
I'm feeling lost inside the frame
Of my lonely darkest days
So far from your heart babe
How can u kill this love
As the world is sleepin' at night
You know I think around my life
It was like a dream
Now it's just a nightmare
All the ways you're draining my eyes
All the pain you make me cry
All I get is this vengeance of you
I ain't got the courage to defend
So far from your heart
Babe
Why do you let me fall
So far from your heart
Darling
How can you kill this love
I hope these words catch you inside
I wish they enter your private life
I am down on my knees
Please don't make me suffer
The times we tried to reach for the sky
Now I guess I was so blind
Oh I was just the one
To hope our dream came true
So far from your heart
Babe
Why do you let me fall
So far from your heart
My darling
How can you kill this love
How can you kill me inside
Show me the secret
Behind your intentions
Before I got
Before I got
Another impression
Of dubious emotions
Cause I don't wanna be your slave
I see you deride
All the feelings I use to hide
I'll never complain
As you hurt me I want to stare
Somewhere there will be something
To explain me why
Oh oh
You want me to be enslaved
By the wish of your love
Show me the way
Of your gratification
Before I was
Before I was
Another insensible
Sign of desolation
Cause I don't wanna take these chains
I see you deride
All the feelings I use to hide
I'll never complain
As you hurt me I want to stare
The pain the anger the suffering
Do you remember the time that we share
When we were one of two
It can't be true
This change of you
Every time that I gave you my life
You hurt me like a knife
In the deep of my heart
You're just a shadow in my love
Oh baby you left me alone
Love is the deepest colour
In my heart that burns in sorrow
Shadows in my love
I can't forget all the times that we shared
You're in everything that moves
How I can love
You never knew
And I can't do without thinking of you
You're still in everyplace
Where we have gone
You're just a shadow in my love
Oh baby you left me alone
Love is the deepest colour
In my heart that burns in sorrow
Shadows in my love
You said that I filled your life
But now I know
You told me lies
You're still beside me inside my dreams
You're just a shadow in my love
Oh baby you left me alone
Love is the deepest colour
In my heart that burns in sorrow
Shadows in my love
Hold me
Enslaved me
And catch me in your dark embrace
Watch me
I'm begging to you
All the dreams that you have
Uhh
I'm bleeding for you
All I know
Is that you're taking me
Into your dark world
All I want
Is the satisfaction
Of your black blood
All I've done
Is another step in you
Because now
I belong to you forever
Take me
Enslave me
And kill me in your dark embrace
Watch me
I'm bleeding for you
And give you all the dreams that I had
Uhh
I'm dying for you
it's all gone
In a hidden part beneath your dark world
 it's all lost
In a drowning fall into your black blood
it's all done
Just another step in you
From now on
I'll belong to you forever
I am still waiting
For the dawn
To heal the wounds inside my heart
The pain's still increasing
I'm wondering
I'm seeking for
The meaning of this pool of blood
You won't watch me creeping
Honestly
I don't know why
You're walking by the straight lines of my mind
Strongly
I need you by my side
I need you I need you I need you by my side
These are the words I never spoke
These clear things never seen before
The broken mirror of your soul
Without my image anymore
This is the time I ever thought
The freedom never felt before
The broken mirror of your soul
Without my essence anymore
The spell now is broken
Definitely from my soul
My hands are stained
What have I done
Your lifeless body on the floor
Your eyes can't start crying
No sympathy
There's no remorse
I did the right way I know for sure
And you can't stop laughing
Honestly
I don't know why
You wander in the dark side of my mind 
Sincerely
I need you by my side
I need you I need you I need you by my side
These are the words I never spoke
These clear things never seen before
The broken mirror of your soul
Without my image anymore
This is the time I ever thought
The freedom I never felt before
The broken mirror of your soul
Without my essence anymore
The spell now is broken
Definitely from my soul
From my soul
I am still waiting for the dawn
To heal the damage inside of my heart
I know I know
There is something
You left behind
In a hidden place in time
It's a strange kind of magic
That makes the sun go down
I never meant to live in sorrow
Never meant to bear this way
I gotta spread all the tears never cried before
Distant spaces for a lonely heart
You're getting all
Cause your name is the meaning of love
You're getting more
What I've got and what I've done
You're getting love
Cause my life is simply a shade
Inside your hateloving heart
I fall I fall
There ain't nothing
I can look bright
It's a glowing glide inside
It's a sort of enchantment
That makes me go so down
I never meant to live this sorrow
Never meant this way at all
I gotta cry all my best for the sake of you
There's no heaven for a lonely heart
You're getting all
Cause your name is the meaning of love
You're getting more
What I've got and what I've done
You're getting love
Cause my life is simply a shade
Inside your hateloving heart
You're getting all
Cause your name is the meaning of love
You're getting more
What I've got and what I've done
You're getting love
Cause my life is simply a shade
Inside your hateloving heart
You feel so blue
You feel so alone
I know there is no more chance to
To make it right
To fall n' die
You've got to realize
Invite the poison
Don't b afraid
You never have to live this way
Invite the poison
With no remorse
This life you know is something wrong
You feel so down
You feel so untrue
I know there is no more time to
To make it real
Your dreams they steal
You got to realize
Invite the poison
Don't waste your time
You never have to live in pain
Invite the poison
Don't hesitate
This life you know it's something wrong
You try n' try
Just one more time
There is no God
Who wants to hear you prayin'
I'll fly over you
I'll b your guide
N' teach you to fly
Over this land
Of misery
You'll fly over your tragedies
N' teach you to fly
N' teach you to fly
To this special place
Where you'll never fall in pain
Escaping
The sun light
And waiting for the dark to come
I'm craving
And taking
A long breath to begin to run
Distortion
Contortion
A never ending dispute in my brain
I'm acting
Or just pretending
To be the man that I am not
This is just my opinion
I'm crushed by love
I'll lose myself into the oblivion
I'm crushed by love
Have I got to go away
Have I got to mend my mistakes
Ooooh I'm crushed by love
I want to fly free
And break all these chains you imposed me
Don't wannabe crushed by love
I want to break lose
I don't wanna see you deride me
Don't wannabe crushed by love
Refusing
The delight
Of your bloody kisses on my heart
I'm waiting
N' searching
For another chance to be the one
I take over
And consider
Every lie you told me from the start
I am acting
Or just pretending
To have the strength that I have not
This is just my opinion
I'm crushed by love
I'll lose myself into the oblivion
I'm crushed by love
Have I got to run away
Have I got to mend my mistakes
Ooooh I'm crushed by love
I want to fly free
And break all these chains you imposed me
Don't wannabe crushed by love
I want to break lose
I don't wanna see you deride me
Don't wannabe crushed by love
How do you feel
When my emotions come to real
And all your breath declines
Into silver drops of light
The vanishing point
Where I put my mortal spoils
Where I'd like to fade away
Where I'd like to cut my veins
These shades of grey
These shades of me
I made this void inside
These shades of grey
You left in me
I never meant to change your life into death
How can you feel
As my devotion comes to real
As I weep myself to sleep
Into these crawling shades of grey
This perishing light
If I try to close my eyes
If I try to fade away
Now it's time to cut my veins
These shades of grey
These shades of me
No redemption for your life
These shades of grey
You left in me
I never meant to change your life into death
Fear  Coldness  Confusion
The twisted form of my mind
An empty cradle painted of black
This is the maze that closed myself
These shades of grey
These shades full of memories
These shades prevail
Surrounding all I see
The shades of grey
The shades of my life
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised she's got me with
Nothing to win and
Nothing left to lose
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live

Deception into your soul
It will creep
Like the fundation of a certain demise
Reflection facing a vision so deep
Leaves reality seem like a lie
Downward the only way
Soulless interaction
Beneath you dragin' you down
Drowning your soul erased
Altered state addiction
Slowly into decline
Magic enlightment celestial deliverance
Taking horrors carry them away
Supernatural redemption
A narcotic mirage
Creates a psychotic haze
Downward the only way
Soulless interaction
Beneath you dragin' you down
Drowning your soul erased
Altered state addiction
Slowly into decline
Crying so afraid to let go
Falling into a neverending hole
Fading cannot see the light
Here in isolation
Seeing more than the eye can see
Safe in peaceful silence
So far out of reach
Closer to purest liberty
Isolation is what I seek
Manifest with the long lost truth
Where pain and agony is absolute
In this life of sadness
True serenity lies within
Dream of distant places
Where no soul has ever been
In my mind
No time no space
So close
Yli metsien uinuvan veen
Kuutar taivaan yÃÂÃÂ¶n valaisee
Maalaa maiseman pohjoisen siimeksen
Unta onko tÃÂÃÂ¤ÃÂÃÂ¤
Vai kuolema jossa palata sinne saan missÃÂÃÂ¤
hiillos jo luovuttaa lumen alla
Kun astun maailmaan erÃÂÃÂ¤maan aikaan
Ensilumi satoi kahdesti
Maalasi sieluni taulun
Lapsuuteni metsÃÂÃÂ¤n taivaan
Kaikuu se haikeus halki tÃÂÃÂ¤n matkan

Ensilumi satoi kahdesti
Maalasi sieluni taulun
Lapsuuteni metsÃÂÃÂ¤n taivaan

The Last One In The Wilderness
Wilderness sleeps and I travel in my thoughs
over the woods and sleeping water
Lady Moon lights the sky
Paints the world in shade of north
Is this dream
Or death where I want to return to place
where embers are giving up hope under the snow
As I step into the world the time of wilderness
First snow fell twice
Painted the painting of my soul
This bold beauty and infinite loneliness
Of my childhood forest and sky
That beauty echoes through this journey
As the morning dawns night tells it's story
Bold is beauty and my infinite loneliness
That's what man longs for his soul
The grave of my cradle the place of my grave
is the last one in the wilderness
Where did the others go
Swampwitches and towers of the maiden
and the coniferous trees in the shadows
I planted a lily of the valley into eversnow
And as the silence came I relied on the future
First snow fell twice
Painted the painting of my soul
This bold beauty and infinite loneliness
Of my childhood forest and sky
That beauty echoes through this journey
As the morning dawns night tells it's story
Bold is beauty and my infinite loneliness
That's what man longs for his soul
The grave of my cradle the place of my grave
is the last one in the wilderness
Icarus your presence imperceptible
My son my blood I can't recognize you anymore
What made you frightened What changed you whole
Don't blow out the mist around
Don't make the air more clear
Delightful winds don't make the sky more clear
Mist that separated us
Without a right for my perilous try
If I deserved it I would find the way to die
Icarus what happened there my son
My son you were too close and too fast
Mist that separated us
Am I held captive for the rest of time
What if the mist's a product of deluded mind
Water makes things heavier
Heat will melt your wings
Nothing's what you'll ever learn
With eyes blindfolded facing sky in fear
Mist that separated us that separated us
The edge that doesn't allow us to fly
Now put my corpse to sleep
Give me a child and I'll give you a man
Able to form it I'll mold it like clay
Give me your child I will give you a man
With shapeless water I will pour your vase
Would you do that for me
Give me a child and I'll give you a man
Able to form it I'll mold it like clay
Give me your child I will give you a man
With shapeless water I will pour your vase
That's only one way road
No turning back at all
If you do not conquer self
You will be conquered by self
With stones on my neck and sourness in mouth
I saw a monster the lion up high
Raised his head above the clouds
So I behold a shallow littleness of mine
That would be
Then I heard a thunder a squeak of birds of prey
Revelation to all corners of this dormant world
A choir of those who burn
That would be like the splendor of the mighty
I am become death
I am become destroyer
The destroyer of worlds
I felt its blow a hit of giant dragon claw
Knocking down to the knees life ceases to exist
The view like a mirror reflection of mine
Its not me anymore its not me
I am become death
The destroyer of
I am become destroyer
I am become
The destroyer of worlds
For I am become death
I am become destroyer
The destroyer of worlds
Despair to get out before lies melt away
What drives us insane
Locked inside a house set ablaze
Back stab the shame
Then breathe breathe breathe the relief
Salt salt bathe the wound
And scrape scrape scrape the fuck out of it
Whole world is going to change
Towards delusion we roam
Right where we stand
I can't stand the hoax
Whole world's going to change
I should have listened to you
Right where we stand
We are trapped for good
Months into years like centuries
Made of days spent in fire a lesson of misery
To cope with regrets of destructive collapse
This place will always be the stronghold of lies
Back stab the shame
Then breathe breathe breathe the relief
Salt salt bathe the wound
And scrape scrape scrape
'Cause it's the only life you have
Distaste of inhuman measures yet bonded with awe
I avoid what I already know
I avoid what I already know
I avoid what I already know
This void is all left to know
Whose name for echoes to carry
How glorious the sacrifice
Those flags couldn't care less for honor
These men don't know yet they're gone
Shotguns moan in the distance
So we know you arrived
Couldn't say we've been waiting
Couldn't help but invite
Battalions at the edge of frontier
Armed yet sweetly defenseless
Repressions assigned with no order
Until we decide
Until we decide to
Strike you down and your terrible mistake
The disintegration sad fall of all nations
Into arms of destruction you rush
Aggression suppressed
Warmongers turned pale
Discord dissent
Thousands of earthquakes
Made us great undertakers
Watched the life being born
Watched it growing old
No threat out there for we are the keepers
We are the keepers we run the sky
Dismembered chrome soldiers neglected withdrawn
Sleeping grounds so very ours
Grounds so ours
The disintegration sad fall of all nations
Into arms of destruction you rush you rush
Strike you down your terrible mistake
Strike into arms of destruction you rush
Desensitized to every feeling ever known to men
I walk into the shadows land
Where guilt continues and spans for aeons
Too obsessed to stop
I'll never get caught
Chain of consequence locks
Other than the aftermath of vanity
Footsteps whispers wreck my ears
Too obsessed to stop
I'll never get caught
Chain of consequences tightens around my neck
It's not a place for lightness
Blackness immersed it all
Shroud yourself in grimness
It perfectly fits your pale mouth
Just put out the candle
It's easier than feeding the fire
Don't let anybody find you
Abandon all hope who enter inferno
Who seek for blackness eternal
Tar  blood of the earth
Stench of rot growing for years
Touch up all remorse with that
So blissful is mind when painted black
Filthy is more genuine
So serious and so real
Like the world on the edge
No details no taste
Abandon all hope who enter inferno
Ye who seek for filth eternal
Surrender and withdraw
Who seek for noise eternal
Abandon all hope
Abandon all
Abandon all
Silence means no control
Silence terrifies us most
Don't listen to those who claim to know better
Bring conscience up short
Wipe order out once and for all
Abandon all hope who enter inferno
Who seek for blackness eternal
Ye who bless unintelligence
What do you do what should I do
Liar you fucking liar don't turn your back on me
I will not take this shit again again
Everytime I portray you I envision a bitch
I will not take this shit again again
As the sun sets on darkness on the darkest day
It reveals to me all the shadows of mercy
All I ever needed was a like to overpower
All I ever received was nothing was nothing
This is the start of a new life
Wake up
As you constrict him by all of these chains
As you hide behind this curtain of shame
Pray to the skies that your mission stays covert
Remain hidden to the ones that you love
This is an act of fucking cowardice
Through dead cold eyes I see everything
Through dead cold eyes I see through you
Your shame shall not drag me down with you
Your perverted views on life will will conquer
I will tear apart your sick life your life
I will see you burn down in life in life
Reveal to everyone the real monster that is you
I will show to everyone your fucked up mind
All you see is the sheet over your eyes
Change to be everything that I can despise
You perceive everything to be what you believe
Seek forth through skies to find the reasons why
Paradise 
Perfect creation of mankind 
Welcome to paradise 
Into the abyss of progression 
Together we create despair and guilt and anger 
Justify 
We should justify our crimes 
Ignore the shore of sympathy 
I die 
The weight of the world keeps you in fear 
You confine yourself in agony 
And condemn yourself to misery 
More and more you turn into yourself 
No one can prevent this tragedy 
Confined in yourself 
Confined in pain 
Confined in agony and shame 
Condemned to misery 
Prevent this tragedy 
The mourning after
My child
And the crowd weeps
reveal the second face of your life 
When you please the soul you'll be unfolded 
but serenity is lost 
as you fall into confusion of your mind 
Dusk you'll see 
Sail the sea of dreams 
Would you like to be drowned in sleep forever 
Join me and stay then darkness will remain 
and drain your consciousness 
Then you'll see the world from beyond 
coward solution easy way out 
Real life ignored 
fantasy taking over now 
Mirror the past 
get a life or wake up dead 
What do you fear 
is it your mind or life you dread 
I think it's you 
Fail and dream 
FailLike convulsing fish unaware
Of the murk in which they swim
The black hole generator
We're all forced to live within
Self awareness imbued biochemical machinery
Searching for our place at the gates of infinity
You to etchings based on fear
Who am I Why am I here
And think  you've found the answer
You presume him greater power
Each rational gaze through the lens of inquiry
Consider now as we all must
The possibility 
That the glorification of a myth
Is what your life has become to be
You look to etchings based on fear
Who an I Why am I here
Religious moral guidance
With its crude bronzeage inception
Steers mankind to shallow depths
And in the wrong direction
We are not the lonely product 
Of a maniac creator
We are all living as a result 
of the black hole generator
We must face a threat to all civilisation 
Dogmatic idealogies with nuclear capacity 
Whose frenzied faithful all desire 
Apocalypse for their Messiah 
Credulous fools with theocratic convictions 
Behold a world 
Their faith inspires 
A howling void no empty of 
Church going choirs 
Asphixiating vortex winds cast corpses away 
From immolation death we're destined to decay 
Is this the result you had in mind 
Can you accept the legacy left behind 
Into your hands 
Into your hands 
Into your hands 
The end of life is like a blazing sunset 
The last time colour fills the sky 
For why lies beyond is engulfing dark 
Where even dreams are left to die 
Into your hands 
Into your hands 
Into your hands 
Into your hands I feel the lashing of the flames
Aeons ago the creation
Of man began sculpting itself
Onward they travelled and grew
From the untamed dark cold caves
Emerged a primal mind
Armed with some basic instincts
Animal man machine primitive mind
Years of development passed
The human race declined
We leap into the era
Animal man machine mechanical mind
The remains of what's left are few
As the four footed posture becomes two
From carving stone to carving steel
From crude constructions to the ultimate machine
From the untamed dark cold caves
Emerged a primal mind
Armed with some basic instincts
Animal man machine primitive mind
Years of development passed
The human race declined
We leap into the era
Animal man machine mechanical mind
Thousands of years Errors to show
What we've done
What we've become
We commence to slowly decompose
Human thirst for discovery
A decadent force with no ken for excess
Mankind's extinction is assured
We'll be superfluous
We'll be overthrown
A path to extinction
Of natural life
Animal man machine
A searing thirsty tattered wreck  
Staggering through the abyss 
Respite from this suffering 
A hope I once dismissed 
On a quest for preservation 
To escape my own negation 
I'll employ a novel strategy 
And plunge into insanity 
Bubbles ripple overhead 
Temperature starts to cool 
The purest water fills my mouth 
In this divine pool 
We have an intellectual reach that 
No mere bodies can contain 
With a leap beyond ancestral bonds 
Only fragments will remain 
Mind now a part of the 
Experience machine 
A sensory extension 
Beyond all previous comprehension 
Bubbles ripple overhead 
Temperature starts to cool 
The purest water fills my mouth 
In this divine pool 
I slip into insanity 
In time I'll shed this skin 
A golden age is beckoning 
Once reborn mind alive 
Embrace this future to survive 
The gentle pull of the tide 
Its sublime ebb and flow 
The soothing spray of stars 
Leads me where I must go 
Face down on a distant secluded shore 
Death only a memory 
Insanity my sanctuary 
Our sanctuary 
Through an everchanging oceanic 
Flow of information 
I'll free myself from the 
Confines of this fleshy prison 
Memory assimilation 
Thoughtprocess integration 
Selfconcept reformation 
Vestigial disintegration 
Bubbles ripple overhead 
Temperature starts to cool 
The purest water fills my mouth 
In this divine pool 
Technological unification 
Initiates this new awakening
The sun heats up the skies as seasons change
The heat intensifies while water levels rise
We try to guess nature's way
The giver of life is taking ours away
What we see and what we know above and below
erosion from rising water flow
creations we made corroded our sphere
the hole is growing  as the end approaches near
threatening tides over horizons
bequeath the fear with power to clear
side effects of technological demand
weaken an ancient icy grasp
the polar giants break at last
threatening tides over horizons
bequeath the fear with power to clear
we scuttle for the summit
with hopes to see the dawn
sea to summit
there will be no fire
there'll be no more war
nothing but serenity
in the underwater world
the waves pick up the pace 
the legions of Neptune charge forth
as they surround the land
we dread the end
the flag will soon fall
earth will crumble drowning us all 
threatening tides over horizons
bequeath the fear with power to clear
we scuttle for the summit
with hopes to see the dawn
As I peer into the depth of tranquility
Through spiraling mist and towering flame
Obsidian rings become clear to me
And from that path a voice screams my name
Split ears screech with deafening tones
Clenched jaws grind enamel away
Eyelids seal with blow torch glows
A wretched figure commands me to stay
The old hag beckons
Now chained to her will
No choice but submission
Is her job to kill
Visuals glow with frenzied pace
Dry throat leaves a bitter taste
Constricted lungs begin to fill
With laughter from her shrouded face
A haggard cloaked manifestation
Of a hypnagogic delusion
Or supernatural intervention
The likes of which we dare not mention
Disembodied mind
Limbs contract while sinew steams
Upon the groans of jointless bones
Feargripped heart begins to beg
For release from the tyranny
Of the hag at the end of my bed
The rusted chains dance in the ash
To the echoes of our brothers
The end is the means and no soul
Is too lost to taste of its rancid deception
It's when the realms of thought
Dictate our steps that we scratch
Out the truth of existence
In solve
Coagula
Another page is torn
The desecration of all primal
You I see right through you and
The battalions of blood willing martyrs
How did you trade the branch of knowledge
For the seeds of perverse decline
It's when the realms of thought
Dictate our steps that we scratch
Out the truth of existence
A fleeting idea sanctioned as fact and defended
Beyond all reason the burden of proof is a
A new light is born
To shield the unscorn children
Another page is torn
The desecration of all primal
Solve
Coagula
Another page is torn
We grew as one through infancy 
In seperable through maturity 
Now laces with the threat 
Of annihilation 
Ideals make way for wartime operations 
Strobelight shrapnel 
Tears tissue asunder 
My shocked eyes gaze 
Refusing to see 
A bloodstained path to 
My brother reveals 
His unhealable open wounds' frailty 
Inconceivable pain 
Irrevocable affliction 
Powerless am I 
To make you whole once again 
PANACEA 
Powerless am I 
PANACEA 
To make you whole once again 
Petrifying empathy 
Takes complete control of me 
He's involuntarily tethered 
To these last moments of pain 
It may be his last desire 
To be bathed in friendly fire 
A terminal reaction to a hopeless situation 
BrotherPlease Send me on my way 
BrotherPlease Release me from this pain 
It seems that even gods on high 
Refuse to let my brother die 
Responsibility now thrust on me 
Any burden I bear 
Shall be secondary 
A fratricide you're empowering 
To end all your suffering
The orders passed as news breaks out
Officials have declared
The diplomatic strain was not resolved
And once again the peace talks failed
As head of state puts pen to paper
A clearance to attack a new frontier
The nation marvels
As the war machine kicks into gear
Mobilization of grim assets
The power of fire and steel
Escorted by an entourage of experts
Their one objective is to kill
Ear piercing harmonies of grating metal
The deployment has begun 
Commencement of offensive operations
The enemies shall topple one by one
Truth in the hands
Of the righteous authorities
The rise of the just
All targets locked and ready
Opponent lurks in unfamiliar terrain
The triggers click and set off the inferno
Of yet another bloody merciless campaign
The earth accepts discarded matter 
The ash the blood the sweat
The fragments of the fallen stay behind
Awaiting their days of lament
No price is too unreasonable
When honour is at stake
Blood weighs as much as water
To those who don't grieve at the wake
The war machine advances
As the money fuels the hungry fire
The power in the hands of those
Who clench the power to conspire
Blood on the hands of corrupt authorities
The demise of the truth
Miscreant
Miscreant at the helm
The truth will always find a place to hide
In the cracks of deceptive formalities
While reliable sources rely on rewards
In exchange for distorted realities
For years I have gazed at a stone wall
With no vision of nature and allegiances
From dawn to darkness
The inner beast surrounds my thoughts
Absent from entity
For one man's greed
My past dominates my rage
His surface must drain
A view of bareness floods my mind
Hate rises like a scorching fire
Banished from delectation
Awaiting a destructive departure
Blackness annihilates my purity
Vengeance controls my serenity
Absent from entity
Absent for eternity
For years I have weakened
Where true madness lies
Breeding a diseased bloodthirsty mind
The inner beast will deface yours
Absent from entity
For one man's greed
My past dominates his fate
I reap the world winds Come forth I call you now
I am a dragon hidden behind a lion
I reap the world winds Come forth I call you now
I am a dragon hidden behind a lion
I am the harvester of pain
I am a dragon hidden behind a lion
So enter be welcomed I cherish your presence
I reap the world winds Come forth I call you now
I am a dragon hidden behind a lion
I am a tiger crouching behind a gentle smile
How does it feel to be flying
How does it feel to be flying
The ancient halls the great dimension 6
Have you ever tasted the sweetness of the dying
The sweetness of the dying upon thee
Anticipation
In this world of fallen I'm seeking you
I am the one untouched by time
I am the shadow that clouds your mind
I am the dreams that failed
I am the night watchman
I am the prince of the dark
Inside these halls where stones are talking
You shall be set free
Forever you shall wander eternity with me
Let me take you to the borders of dream
The liberation
In this world of fallen I am seeking you
In the halls of dream nothing seems unreal
Fantasy explored
Yes this world of dream
Feeds your fantasy Imagination
You see In a tiny second you'll have clarity
In this world of fallen I am seeking you
In this world of fallen I am seeking you
We walk the earth with grim faces
Leaving memories the dust beneath our boots
The sun rising is but a pale
A pale shadow of what it used to be
We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
Like ghosts we move
We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
We're doomed to hell
We walk on soil forgotten by men
In a shadow of pale moonlight
Our hearts are black
We have no hope in a world that dies
We hear it's cries
We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
Like ghosts we move
We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
We're doomed to hell
We are the 3rd generation Armageddon
Like ghosts we move
Lost souls in a choir of sorrow
Dancing to a mournful symphony
In a world that lives no more
We walk the earth with grim faces
Leaving memories the dust beneath our boots
Our heart's extinct we embrace no faith
No faith no hope there's no reality
We are the 3rd Generation Armageddon
In a room without light
I sense my horrors creeping up on me
Stray images scars me
In a room without light
My reality feels so unreal
Imagination betray my common sense
In a room without light
I battle everyday
Exposed and vulnerable
Seeking the future
In a war against my past with every heartbeat
I push the past away Striding forward
As the only memories I desire
Is the memories of the future
In a room without light
My future became unreality
And beauty became a spawn of betrayal
And I return to a room without light
Exposed and vulnerable
Within my shell I raise and stand
Listening to the echoes of your fall
Your sweet voice in my head resounding
With the lies you served one by one
And for this you became my betrayer
And I hate you
Please help me now as I am falling
I've lost the sense of what is real
Transparent yes Illusive
In a dreamlike state of mind
Please help now as I have fallen
I'm loosing sense of who I am
Erase and rewind
Play the tape all over again
I'm lying in a pool of my own dirt
Trying to understand
Understand why all this shit
Is falling down on me
Again and again and over and over
And on and on
Why is this happening to me
I am in pain
Gently falling
The rain that falls from my eyes
As I sought the wind
I now harvest
I harvest the storm
Please help now as I have fallen
I'm loosing sense of who I am
Erase and rewind
Play the tape all over again
I am the soul fallen from the sky
A lonely soul with hatred in his heart
My gentle smile is caressing you
Can you see the truth shining through
Illusive
So Illusive
Illusive before you I stand
Can you feel my heart beating
To the sounds of despair
The fate I am facing
Is whispered in the air
The sands of time collapse
In a desert of eternity
A galaxy of dreams
As the winds of sorrow sweep across the night
And lay to sleep at the brink of dawn
Can you feel my breath chilling
Trembling in the air
The fate I am facing
Is a whisper of my fear
Flying on the wings of sleep
I am travelling in a dream so deep
In visions of grandure
Till I touch the moon
On the soil of mother earth
I see the coming of another past
The present is futile
And the future is all
Can you feel my blood flowing
My heat upon your skin
The fate I am facing
Is a whisper of my fear
Exit devotion
Enter lies and deceit
Playful minds for me to reap
With an overdose of ecstasy
Sleep
Enter dreams a vision seek
Travel through the night so bleak
With an overdose of ecstasy I succeed
Ecstasy
Exit devotion
Enter lies and deceit
Playful minds for me to reap
With an overdose of ecstasy
Sleep
Enter dreams a vision seek
Travel through the night so bleak
With an overdose of ecstasy
These days are full of tragedies
A life that couldn't be
The dead born sound
Is A whisper in the air
Come walk with me
I'll take you away
Through the gates of reality
The rising sun we cannot see
It's killing me
Fly with me
On the wings of fantasy
As we roam the pale earth
In a neverending search
Life begins and ends a thousand times
Feeds my hunger
Ease my torments
My yearn for flesh
Paint me something bleach
Come walk with me
I'll take you away
Through the gates of reality
Sparkling shadows all around
In my soul that whispering sound
Bring back my glamour once so proud
Forgotten in a sleeping shape
A bleeding mind so sad above
Despise the life and rule my fate
I'd rather die than feel that hating love
An angel drowned in shadows pale
A rotten sculpture a forgotten tale 
A fire that flickered in that heart
Got torn by dreams so far apart
Caress me into that burning sleep
With broken wings and mortal vain
I have that poison secret
Will fly away and disappear in pain
Abused flesh and betrayed mind
For the one who was too blind
Try to escape but too late
Memories of a divided heart
An angel drowned in shadows pale
A rotten sculpture a forgotten tale
Who I think I am is that really who I am
A million questions travel through my mind
The cryptic writings on the wall
In uncomprehensive shapes
Like a small player
In the greatest of games I stand
Sparkling shadows all around
In my soul that whispering sound
Bring back my glamour once so proud
Forgotten in a sleeping shape
A bleeding mind so sad above
Despise the life and rule my fate
I'd rather die than feel that hating love
In this mirror all I see
A fading image that isn't me
Am I a master of my will
Or nothing but a puppet on a tiny string
The dawn what of the dawn
We have come to kill by sun or by moon
Escalating from the darkest pits of hell
And gather strength where the fire's dwell
Behold the black horseman
On his winged steed
The prince of darkness soaring high
Behold the black horseman
On his winged steed
A pitch black shadow
Against a pale white moon
The dawn what of the dawn
We seek the comfort of the dark
The plains of battle before us lay
You will never see another day
Never Never again
The dawn what of the dawn
We've come to kill by sun or by moon
The dawn that you seek will fade
Can't you see this is the end
The rain of terror will fall upon thee
When you fall to the ground in tears
Behold his glory as you die
The dawn what of the dawn
We have come to kill by sun or by moon
Escalating from the darkest pits of hell
And gather strength where the fire's dwell
Our army before you will mesmerize you
Violence to the art
All life is forsaken
The dark has awoken
The fire that burns in our hearts
We are the glorious
Mighty warriors come to call your doom
This night we'll be victorious
The dawn what of the dawn
We've come to kill by sun or by moon
The dawn that you seek will fade
Can't you see this is the end 
The rain of terror will fall upon thee
When you fall to the ground in tears
Behold his glory as you die
Never to be seen again
And none of you will ever see another dawn
Why can't we find ourselves
Here again
You You Seem so away
And now I know
That we will never be
What you always wanted
We'll never be
What you always wanted

Catastrophic way to live your life until the end
Walking upon your bones this is what you want
Tasting your magic moment feeling as a god
Distorted visions without a sense of no return
Nobody will touch you nobody will hurt you
When the darkness falls and the lights go down
Evil thoughts are growing in my heart
For a future with love and hope
Destroyed by the lies this is what you want
Failing your magic moment feeling as a shit
Distorted visions without a sense of no return
When the darkness falls and the lights go down
Evil thoughts are growing in my heart
For a future with love and hope
Something's ride away across the seven seas
Something fade away and I
Search a reason why
I fall into your eyes
Someone will destroy this time
For a future with love and hope
Knowledge growing inside my head
Refusing all these stereotypes
I'm looking for my thread of thought
We are just poor human flesh
Don't ask me why I'm feeling lonely without you
I need a reason to break free
I need a place to stay alone
I need someone to tell me what I'm looking for
Feeling you near tasting the fear
I'm feeling lost in my dreams
I need to find a better way to live
You know I'm trying to survive
Don't ask me why I'm feeling lonely without you
I need a reason to break free
I need a place to stay alone
I need someone to tell me what I'm looking for
Feeling you near tasting the fear
I'm feeling lost in my dreams
I'll be the future master of the insanity
I will reign with just one word
Keep your mind and your eyes open to survive
Keep yourself alive
Yourself alive
Be mine this night
Be my queen
Someday my heart will meet your love
so close to be so real
Through this road and through this pain
never been so real
I'll make my choice
These words cannot prove the love I feel for you
I see your eyes in my eyes cutting like a knife
Yourself alive
Be mine this night
Be my queen
Someday my heart will meet your love
so close to be so real
Through this road and through this pain
never been so real
I'll make my choice
Unspoken words unkept promises
This is what a man should do in his life
Unbroken alliance still on and on and on
We just don't know time after time
Lost in this world
I'll find a reason why
Together we will fight
Together we'll survive
To millions battle just to testify our love
Who will be the next today
It's been a shame it's been so fake
To be prisoners of ourself
We just don't know time after time
Lost in this world
Story will tell who will be wise
And who will survive
Caught in this world
Caught through this lies
Breaking this chains to be alive
Someone inside me is changing my thoughts
Someone inside me suggest me the truth
I can't understand well if it's me or a dream
This voice is rising but now I believe
Just right here I'm sitting alone
Into this cold and empty room
Hiding my face between my hands
I've just realize that I'm a fool
I cannot escape from myself
Please give me a reason to be
A man that I've never been
A man that should be free
To think and to live
Where nightmares and dreams collide
How does it came it was a mistake
Born from the visions behind my eyes
This thing left aside now is sweeping in me
Blow it away now would mean sanity
Hiding my face between my hands
Bleeding I am I can't understand
I cannot escape from myself
Please give me a reason to be
A man that I've never been
A man that should be free
To think and to live
Where nightmares and dreams collide
Whispers and tears under the signs of time
This feeling is to deep for me for me
Since I'll be back for just one reason
I will destroy all the barricades
Fighting for just one more day
I'll keep your thought into my mind
drinking the blood of my enemies
Living for just one more day
Facing the desert without fear
Only the brave will destroy this faith
Escaping from this battle
I'm sure I will kill the king of the kings
Since I'll be back for just one reason
I will destroy all the barricades
Fighting for just one more day
I'll keep your thought into my mind
drinking the blood of my enemies
Living for just one more day
I just want to live my life for you
Feel your presence was the first thing for me
That I had I miss you
Looking down this bed that will remain so empty
I'll be there all day long I'll take care of you
Take my heart away so far away it's no
T too late
It's not too late for me
In the clothes I can see a little shapes of you
Who's to blame for this shame I'm dressing on
We walk this road without fear
I will deny all these lies
Can I help you this time
It's not too late for me
This time I'll take it my own way
This time it just won't be a fake
Don't look at me don't judge me now
The words you said I'm screaming out
Don't speak at me don't bother me
The shortest straw has pulled out
Infernal thoughts burning my mind
Unleashed upon us all
My brain is cracking down in hate
What should I do is turn the page
I've lost control I can't believe
The scent of you is killing me
For every step I'll take
There will be a bounds I have to break
I guess I'll be alone
just give me a peace of mind
Stay by my side and we will rejoin as one
My eyes bleeding this tears for you
This earth is your world
Don't let the nature die for your crimes
And build a new frontiers for your child
I gotta feel it
Just keep a little moment
 for you and me tonight
To live just little closer
You can stop this shame you can give us a chance
To let this shit outside
The sky looks so fine
The mountain is so high
I feel I'm reaching this life
The sunshine makes me fly
Up to your eyes
I gotta feel it
Just keep a little moment
 for you and me tonight
To live just little closer
You can stop this shame you can give us a chance
Eyes closed nothing more to say
In the finest crest of ebony
A familiar name carved in ivory
I will forever owe my first one
For grabbing me needing me returning me
Facing tomorrow
We walked through halls of pain holding close
Earth Mother and this father earthbound together
We brought the memories home holding close
Earth Mother and this father earthbound forever
The earth now treasure my deprived
Once soft and pale these memories stain
Underneath this stone a truth so cruel
All so divine the scavenger awaits its prey
This burden of grief pulling in me
So much colder and with no relief
The truth to it all revealed
This hopeless life I led my own blood I let shed
Overwhelmed by this tragedy
Wrapped up in harmony
Close your eyes no more will to be
As nature is delivering me
This burden of grief pulling in me
So much colder and with no relief
The truth to it all revealed
We walked through halls of pain holding close
Earth Mother and this father earthbound together
We brought the memories home holding close
Earth Mother and this father earthbound forever
A deathlike silence sweeping the land
A room filled with the smell of death and decay
Anger wash over me as memories stir my mind
My body is numb agonized and blind
Spinning through emotional fields
Once I surely tasted paradise
But now I weep
Will I ever see this paradise unveil
I will be searching for all my years
Strangely waiting among the shadow of the stones
I now feel connected while in your garden
An internal storm that hates me
And this storm always outlasts me
I wish I could believe in angels and demons
I wish I could believe
I wish I could believe in angels and demons
I wish we could meet again
Welcome to my world of denial
Welcome to the realm of the lost
Come feel the stillness of my garden
Where my blood has soaked the ground
Once I surely tasted paradise
But now I weep
Will I ever see this paradise unveil
I will be searching for all my years
I wish I could believe in angels and demons
I wish I could believe
I wish I could believe in angels and demons
I wish  we could meet again
I will be searching for all my years
Our time was short
But unbreakable bonds in a flood of blood
This link to the past
Is forever a totem in my life
This place that we visit
Our secret that we groom and cherish
This pain I don't want to forget
Always a peace within me
Through sleepless nights
Coldhearted facts of life
The meaning of it all so unfair
This ride I did not foresee
Flood River Blood
No time to waste
There was nobody there that could save you
Nobody there to help me
Flood River Blood
With power to breathe life
If there was a God he would have saved you
But now I have lost my belief
This token of love
All I have within my heart will be remembered
Your skin so cold
So cold a touch so hard to explain
I have now found peace
A conclusion to where we inherit from
We can't rule over life
Down into the earth we will follow
Through sleepless nights
Coldhearted facts of life
The meaning of it all so unfair
This ride I did not foresee
Flood River Blood
No time to waste
There was nobody there that could save you
Nobody there to help me
Flood River Blood
With power to breathe life
If there was a God he would have saved you
But now I have lost my belief
There is nothing here that can take me lower
Lower than this place I've already seen
Through sleepless nights
Coldhearted facts of life
The meaning of it all so unfair
This ride I did not foresee
Flood River Blood
No time to waste
There was nobody there that could save you
Nobody there to help me
Flood River Blood
With power to breathe life
If there was a God he would have saved you
But now I have lost my belief
Do you know this pain
From the first sting in your heart  Forlorn
All the ideas in your head
All the ideas in my head
What can you do about it
Try to hide behind the grace  All this noise
All these crazy images in your head
All these crazy images in my head
All the ideas in my head
In blur distance no future ahead
My world crash into pieces
It seems like old memories
From one life to another
Lines spinning in my head
Feelings that I can't remember
What happened where did they go
These feelings that I can't remember
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up give us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up give us hope
It gives us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up give us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up give us hope
Here on my weekly down trip
While these crazy people are watching me
While these crazy people are watching me
As a deeper state of coma
A prescription from an unknown hand
Drifting into the drug
Injected to secure my ideas
Injected to secure my memories
All these crazy images in my head
Bloodlines left behind
Bones buried hidden by earth
Life takes mysterious ways
In a blink of an eye all twisted around
Burn my skin pull out my nails
It won't heal invisible scars inside
Bad luck get your act together
Leaving destination unknown
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up give us hope
Look ahead so you don't fall behind
Thoughts keeps us up give us hope
It gives us hope
I'm lost with fever
Drifting into this psychosphere
I wish the stars could tell me
Is this it my last breathall alone
I'm a master of denial
Don't even try to convince me
Am I conscious or lost
Could this be my final dayhere on earth
I'm taking a leap of fate
Never to look back or loose control
I'm beyond despair in silence with my scars
I'm falling  loosing control
I'm falling  a desecrator
I'm lost with fever
This task called life I failed
I hear an echo from the unknown
I cannot exclude these cynical ideas
I'm taking a leap of fate
Never to look back or loose control
I'm beyond despair in silence with my scars
I'm falling  without control
I'm falling  a desecrator
I hear an echo from the past
I cannot exclude these cynical ideas
I'm heading into the unknown
All my fears are now at peaceall alone
I'm taking a leap of fate
Never to look back or loose control
I'm beyond despair in silence with my scars
I'm falling  loosing control
I'm falling  a desecrator
I'm leaving this planet earth
I'm leaving
In solitude looking into the flame that burns
Alongside with your memory
Desolation a picture of my fallen star
A broken branch in my family tree
In my family tree
I raise my head now defying this obvious truth
That night came and our heaven turned to Hell
That night came and our heaven turned to Hell
Our heaven turned to Hell
Drowning hope remembering all the pain
Fear of loosing memories in the daily haze
It was the time we should fill with laughter
Of our newly arriving joy
The siren grabs you with tragic hunger
Flashing blue cutting through the view
A message of death that no one could foresee
My fallen
May not live to roam this earth
My fallen
Changed my life forever
My fallen
Left a mark inside so sore
My fallen
Only solitude within my core
The siren grabs you with tragic hunger
Flashing blue cutting through the view
A message of death that no one could foresee
How many dreams I have chased on my road
I don't feel for anything anymore
All just fragments of disposable waste
A cesspool of terror displaying hate
That night came and our heaven turned to Hell
Our heaven turned to Hellto Hell
My fallen
May not live to roam this earth
My fallen
Changed my life forever
My fallen
Left a mark inside so sore
My fallen
Only solitude within my core
The siren grabs you with tragic hunger
Flashing blue cutting through the view
A message of death that no one could foresee
Inside this hall waiting for the fallthe fall
A shock that left me in the dark
Can I allow myself to have these feelings
Bringing me into temptation pin down the reality
I need to toss this blame I have in my head
All my future years already planned
There was made no room for mistakes
Even if the Devil wants to lead me
Into a deeper state of doubt
Am I the destroyer of my bloodline
Am I the destruction to my own life
Am I the butcher of my future
Am I the downfall of my heritage
In a parallel world as travellers
Still I sense this presence visiting me
A piece of me lost in a twirl of misery
Leaving me in a wasteland of desolation
How could I let this life slip through my hands
All my future years already planned
There was made no room for mistakes
Even if the Devil wants to lead me
Into a deeper state of doubt
Am I the destroyer of my bloodline
Am I the destruction to my own life
Am I the butcher of my future
I am  the downfall of my heritage
I am drifting
Into a deeper state of doubt
I am  The destroyer of my bloodline
The earth has swallowed my pride
There is no need to believe
This God has left me anyway
A wayward soul  At the edge of the world
With a one way ticket  To the bottom deep
With a one way ticket  To the bottom deep
The deepCome followinto the deep
The earth has swallowed my pride
There is no need to believe
This God has left me anyway
A wayward soul
At the edge of the world
With a one way ticket  To the bottom deep
With a one way ticket  To the bottom deep
A Wayward soul a wayward soul
This image of a vulture's head
Casting a shadow resembling death
Waiting while he listens to your breath
Its beak ready to pick up your flesh
An image of a livid face
Exposed over a stormy sky
I try to reach but it fades away
Drifting on while I still search
This trauma triggers my thoughts
You are the one that I owe
For the influence of my return
The vague shape of better things to come
At gunpoint I could shimmer
What if life that really matters
All these thoughts I put into form
Will there be light on the other side
Time still tearing on me
A downward spiral that bleeds
Lost in the barren part of my mind
These tears still bleed within
In silence you speak to me
Please wait for me at the edge of the world
With a one way ticket  To the bottom deep
With a one way ticket  To the bottom deep
In silence you speak to me
You speak to me
Please wait for me
Please wait for me
At the edge of the world
This hovering shadow I see
It's touch of death surrounds me
No glimmer of hope in a distant sight
Memories of life
On this vision the feed
Leaving this world
The end is complete
Surely the bottom deep
Visions dark as never seen
Looking down on an empty shell
Bones left for the earth to dissolve
We have reached the end my friend
This is the end
Surely the last descend
Those who enter can never leave
As darkness swallows all light
The end is complete
Surely the bottom deep
Visions dark as never seen
Looking down on an empty shell
Bones left for the earth to dissolve
We have reached the end my friend
We have reached the end
We have reached the end
We have reached the end
This is the end
From the islands to the cities
From the ports into the sea
We are strong we will always be
Blazing through the wreckage burning all we see
The life we lead committed to be free
Our union is a fortress
Together we are bound
A common bound in freedom and in sound
So raise your voices high
For miles around to hear
Let them know we are drawing near
In union we stand as they blaze across the land
In union we make a final stand
A peaceful coexistence is dropping out of sight
So band together together we will fight
Blasting the resistance marching to the top
They started this we say when it stops
Strike fear within their hearts
Strike down those in your way
Let them know that we live today
They throw us into flames
Did not hear our cries
But now from the ashes we arise
In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand
In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand
In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand
In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand
Our union is our fortress
Together we are bound
A common bound in freedom and in sound
So raise your voices high
For miles around to hear
Let them know we are drawing near
In union we stand as they blazed across the land
In union we make our final stand
In union we stand as they blazed across the land

I once was dead but now Im alive Now Im alive

If He could do it back then He can do it today
Oh Lord the heavens shake when we cry Your name
The gift of God has captured our world
Stand and embrace the power of this moment
The King of Kings the great and mighty
We choose to meet You face to face
than scheduled prayers and empty words
themselves the Body
fade away
nothing else remain
nothing else remain
Does your heart begin to rise at sundown
Does it make you cry to see the heartache
When the city night takes another life
But deep inside you know it's real
I cry a masquerade a fool denies a savior
Your plastic laughter hides the pain
I see you high above it all  tightrope dancer
I see you as you start to fall  tightrope dancer
Cause life's a vapor gone in a flash
Just like a jester in the king's court
When the hammer falls tell me will you stand
I see you high above it all  tightrope dancer
I see you as you start to fall  tightrope dancer
I see you high above it all  tightrope dancer
Downtown alleyways
Where shattered men with broken dreams
Where junkie's cries and pusher's lies
Echo through the streets tonight
Stand and shout For the passing of the world
Stand and shout Its dying echoes call
Stand and shout For a nation far from God
Uptown midnight
Plastic smiles on mannequins
Play the circus of the world elite
Where movie stars and kings and queens
Display themselves on magazines
There where pomp and pretense hide the pain
Stand and shout For the passing of the world
Stand and shout Its dying echoes call
Stand and shout For a nation far from God
Sunday suburbs Great white building stands alone
Dead asleep like those who dwell inside
Bless me Lord now they cry
While outside scores of beggars cry
Empty words like epitaphs on tombs
Stand and shout For the passing of the world
Stand and shout Its dying echoes call
Stand and shout For a nation far from God
Hey little boy playing in the street
Where truth and terror collide
Playing games no one else would dare to try
Your toys are calling out to you
Now you're the game
Cold sweat voices in your head
You numb it with a lie
There's got to be a better way
In someone who loves you  loves you
And someone who cries for you
Hey little girl back in from the world
They broke your heart in two
All you wanted was someone to love you
You gave your heart they took it
Oh look what they've done to you
You've got to open up your heart
To someone who loves you  loves you
To someone who cries for you
Hey Mr Family man
Tired of the rat race lie
As social vices squeeze the life from you
You look for security the dollar takes a dive
Cold sweat voices in your head
You numb it with a lie
There's got to be a better way
In someone who loves you  loves you
And someone who cries for you
Someone who loves you  loves you
Someone who cries for you
You say hello like so many times before
I turn and run away from you
My heart was broke by a love that was unreal
And as you whisper I can hear you say
Stay stay with me I hear you calling out
But I can't believe that love is real
All of my life I've searched for love so true
Tell me can I take a chance on you
You say hello like so many times before
Say hello when no one else would hear my cry
Hello hello my heart is crying out
Say hello can I take a chance on love
And say hello to you
Now I am here with my heart a mile wide
Could you love me like you did before
Now for so long I've wanted love so true
And all this time my heart was needing you
You say hello like so many times before
Say hello when no one else would hear my cry
Hello hello my heart is crying out
Say hello can I say hello to love
And say hello to you
You say hello like so many times before
Say hello when no one else would hear my cry
Hello hello my heart is crying out
Say hello can I say hello to love
Hello hello my heart is crying out
Say hello don't you see I need you so
Hello with love my heart is crying out
Say hello I feel I need you so
Forever now You'll stay a friend of mine
Forever You'll stay by my side
He's like a roaring lion now
But don't hear his lies they'll bring you down
He comes to steal to kill destroy your soul
So stand in God and hold your ground
He's a killer
He's a killer
He's like a wolf who stalks the night
An evil snake with poison lies
Oh foolish men open up your eyes and see
Play with sin and you will die
Cause he seeks those whom he may devour
Run away
He's a killer
He's a killer
Satan wants your soul in hell
But Jesus died so you could live
You know the score the choice is your's tonight
To die in sin or live with Christ
Cause Jesus rose to give you life
He can save you from the killer from the killer
Beware Beware Beware
He's a killer
Madness is on the streets again
Apathy has seized the hearts of men
Evil are the days upon the land
Like the  we seize 
Gaze on the madness
Don't close your eyes
Surrender
Salvation is at hand to captive hearts
Surrender
And don't be afraid  of the dark
Time bombs they tick away our days
Terrorism strikes our deepest fears
Madmen and tyrants rule the age
Blindly how the chosen turn away
Gaze on the madness
Don't close your eyes
Surrender
Salvation is at hand to captive hearts
Surrender
And don't be afraid  of the dark
Shackled to our walls of pride
Hell bound captives to our own desire
Cry out the answers close at hand
Will you choose the bondage or the lamb
Gaze on the madness
Don't close your eyes
Surrender
Salvation is at hand to captive hearts
Surrender
But don't be afraid  of the dark
The windows of the world are open wide tonight
Somebody loves you
So lay your heart down On the line On the line
Give it up to him On the line
Vanity all is vanity in the world you see
It's time you see
Somebody cries for you
Somebody loves you
So lay your heart down On the line On the line
Give it up to today On the line
He paid the price for you on Calvary
He paid the price to set you free tonight
Cause Jesus loves you
So lay your heart down On the line On the line
Give it up to today On the line
Then you called out to me
Come and put your trust in me
Then you set me free
Now I'm right beside you
Within your arms in your love
I'm on my way in your love You and me
Together forever forever free
You set me free
Far away from the scars I know this love is real
Cause when I cried out to you
You said to put your trust in me
Then you set me free
I'm right beside you
Within your arms in your love
I'm on my way in your love Now it's you and me
Together forever forever free
You set me free
No scars no pain
You took them all away You and me
No fear no shame
You took it all away You and me
When you bid love to me
I knew this love was real
You and me You and me You and me You and me
All eyes will see him coming from the clouds
The King of King's arriving with a mighty shout
Hey bride to be yeah get ready for your groom
He's the King
Worship His Majesty
The King of Kings
Then you'll see
His the King the King of Kings
We all live together here on this old earth
Don't you even revere him Who will you serve
Double standard morals fit your every need
You're tightrope dancing straight to hell
All the while saying your free
He's the King
Worship His Majesty
The King of Kings
Then you'll see
His the King the King of Kings
The King of Kings
Hey bride to be yeah get ready for your groom
Want to whore around until the wedding day
He's the King
The King of Kings tonight
Worship His Majesty
The King oh
He's the King
Worship His Majesty
The King of Kings Bow down
You're walking tall you draw your sword out
You strike your weaker brother down
Won't shed a tear for the innocent
Is that what your life's all about
It's time to open your eyes and see
The power of life
The only bloodshed that does us right
Is the blood of Jesus Christ
No more No more lies
Open your eyes
No more No more lies
Politicians and leaders
Filled with slander and pride
For two more votes I will mention Christ
Hypocrite show him your life
Kids run amuck in a world of hate
And you drag them through the fire
You call your grudges religious wars
While the body count grows higher
No more No more lies
Open your eyes
No more No more lies
You say you just don't need a godly form
You say you're doing all right
Listen Righteousness is like filthy rags
It's trash in Jesus' sight
It's time you open your eyes and see
The power of life
The only blood shed that does us right
Is the blood of Jesus Christ
No more No more lies
Open your eyes
No more No more lies
No more No more lies
Open your eyes
No more No more lies
The great dark spaces
No footsteps no clouds
Walking so lonesome
Nothing to see here
The silence that makes you deaf
Does this silence bother you
Does the darkness soothe you
Chained to the scattered thoughts
Fear of your past now
Again confronted with your lies
Stroke for your heart to realize
To make you wake up to see nothing's changed
You're still the same
In your grave your canyon your space
Pressure of the burden makes you silent
The silence that makes you frigid
Burning green forest green leaf brown roots
Deharmonize the evils from your inside
Whispers of the ancient demons
Sworn to be born wild forever
Growth patience end
Light pleasure end
Now it's my season season of my moon
Season to be doomed a grief of my soul
I can not see anymore I can not bear anyone
The hatred is grown in my thoughts and my bone
Walking in the forest thinking of the desert
I killed all of the lights
left me here
your past here to seize your soul
meet again
noose
won't question the cure Carry the lantern high
well
done
that at all
Song
But by the manifestation of conscious awareness
Match your hearts frequency
To life's omnipresent energy
I've never felt so free
With my energy
With truth love and light
We were born from the mud
As entities of love
Soul mind and body entwined
Enshrine and revive that hunger to reach the sun
For then the cowards will run
For the dark with their serpent tongues
Spent my nights distant from nature
Now in my head I have to face this creature
A battle for bliss A gravitational pull
Into the wilderness
Peace Heiwa Frieden Salaam Peace Hotep Sossego
So be a wise man or be a dead man
My journey led me to dismantle the soul gate
Hate filled seeds won't let you grow
Make it love and everything will flow
And I will change to make myself an example
And it will start with us
Now as my death brings an end to the hurt
And my body is one with the earth
My soul transcends above this universe
I know the truth about what I'm worth
A voice descended from the constellations
And echoed through the trees
The moon and the stars calling us to meet
Where the sun sets fire to the sea
If you take away my light
Then I'll decide to live in shadow
To face all the ages of this world alone
With eyes unclouded witness my rebirth
I grew tired of all the propaganda
And found myself in this sick utopia
We create
Only hate for the oppressors
We are the slaves and they're the masters
Hear me now we are the answer
If you take away my light
Then I'll decide to live in shadow
To face all the ages of this world alone
We create our ideal place or state
The cancers hooded and cloaked before the sea
Submerge to abyss
Drown and die in the rising tides
We are the substance they are trying to hide
Behind another subcontracted lie
Engineered version of mankind
Subjects Forced to procreate work and die
The fruitless sublime design
In this planetary cage A fathomless truth awaits
That voice within
I've been to the ends of the soulless black
Felt the chill climb up my back
Fear our soaked pours of fermented pain
Minds poisoned locked away from light
Evil comes for each and every child
As long as those bright eyes gleam up at me
Ill smash through all adversity
To the voices that scream along with me
Your true people here deliberately
I'll never preach from the book of tragedy
What I am now is what I have been
For I am a spawn of infinite awareness
What I will be is what i do now
We gave our minds and our bodies
And this is what we've got in return
Its so surreal watching dreams and reality merge
And we're still so far from the end of the story
But all the world's fame and money
Could not compare to what we've gained already
In life we find pure gems in nonphysical stasis
Show me your heart open your mind
Relinquish the senses and see me
Lost myself in the smoke and the haze
Stuck looking at the world through a toxic gaze
Dependent on a love sick phrase
Dictated my deranged fucked up ways
No more breath for own sympathy
As there's millions without anything
This broken choir that's deafening
Can shift the minds of humanity
Now forget the mind and the body
look deeper inward I'm sure you will learn
and we're still so far from the end of the story
so fuck all of the fame and money
Take another step to steal my soul
Drowning control to feed
The flames of translucent dreams
Like a fly reaching to the light
Blinding eyes and drifting out of sight
It's burning you low
When too much is not enough for you
Stars align fractions of eternity
I'm lost in false sense of security
Constellation to holes in the bleeding sky
Spirit emulating creature
Peeling in as something dies
Interweaved to its web grasping our lives
Bury me down and dig up the hole
Take another step to steal my soul
Drowning control to feed
The flames of translucent dreams
Like a fly reaching to the light
Blinding eyes and drifting out of sight
It's burning you low
When too much is not enough for you
Bury me down and dig up the hole
Take another step to steal my soul
Drowning control to feed
The flames of translucent dreams
Like a fly reaching to the light
Blinding eyes and drifting out of sight
It's burning you low
When too much is not enough for you
Mind tricks behind my eyes
Plugged in to follow my demons in disguise
Stars aligning fragments of the memories
Parallel truth awaken in translucence
Sealed by this deadened song
Sinking in toneless comatose
Come and tear my skin fear what's within
Dig in to yourself and bury the bones
Delve inside to drown in oblivion's holes
Come and tear my skin fear what's within
Explore my every sin and shed my skin
Bury me down and dig up the hole
Take another step to steal my soul
Drowning control to feed
The flames of translucent dreams
Like a fly reaching to the light
Blinding eyes and drifting out of sight
It's burning you low
When too much is not enough for you
Mind tricks behind my eyes
Plugged in to follow my demons in disguise
Stars aligning fragments of the memories
Parallel truth awaken in translucence
Sealed by this deadened song
Sinking in toneless comatose
Its massive darkness filling my world
Submerged rage writing unspoken words
Soaked to the skin
Illusions injected and way out rejected
Nothing's for free so what you wanted to be
Black ocean emptiness explore my ignorance
Chew up my dirty flesh  ignorance is a bless
Shining in a dying light
narcotics in a frantic sight
Take my hand  let's burn together
rise to another level
Linking into radiant winds and storm
In this bleak reality I've been reborn
Dig under my skin with your claws
Camouflage your flaws
My muted speech sticks like a leech
Mirthless divine devouring me raw
Unavoidable disaster turning around my jaw
Shining in a dying light
narcotics in a frantic sight
Take my hand  let's burn together
rise to another level
Linking into cosmic winds and storm
Scrounging and emptying every core
Dig under my skin with your claws
Disguise your flaws
Parasite in an fool's paradise
Playing god now throw the dice
Steering madness completing perfect puzzle
the hand that rocks the cradle
This perfect chaos reforming to reign
It's back never to leave again
Cross the boundaries of dream an true
forsaken passages to refuel
Connecting into breeding engines
Spewing out inhuman purgings
All memories are left in slumber
No one hears you're going under
Stretching out from minority
Playing god by atrocity
The hand that rocks the lachrymose cradle
This perfect chaos  euphoric and fatal
Parasite in an fool's paradise
Playing god now throw the dice
Steering madness completing perfect puzzle
the hand that rocks the cradle
This perfect chaos reforming to reign
It's back never to leave again
Cross the boundaries of dream an true
forsaken passages to refuel
Look inside
To redefine me as your reflection
Grasp my breath
I don't wanna wake up with my head on a plate
Clutch my soul
Asphyxiated and inflammable
Seek and hide
Translucent truth in your mind
Scattering fathomless in depths
Trapped negligent and meaningless
This earthly cage is scorching out
Sweltering at every breath
All I can serve is to stack the bones
Swan dive in consciousness' black holes
Crumbling beneath the cracking skin
This shell I can't hide within
Asphyxiated and inflammable
Tearing this scatterbrained world down
Parting consolation's crown
Float in the tunnel of misconception
A living labyrinth of deception
Imagine the life as a delusion
Morphing to the flames of illusions
Penetrating trust to disarm
Beneath the crust there's a boiling calm
Look inside
To redefine me as your reflection
Grasp my breath
I don't wanna wake up with my head on a plate
Clutch my soul
Asphyxiated and inflammable
Seek and hide
Awaken back in life
Redefine
Asphyxiated and inflammable
Unavoidable settles inside
Impact of a weakening heart beat
Open the box ignite the hell on earth
Obsessively pursued to perfection
Diabolical signs of resurrection
Look inside
To redefine me as your reflection
Grasp my breath
I don't wanna wake up with my head on a plate
Clutch my soul
Asphyxiated and inflammable
Seek and hide
Awaken back in life
Underneath  the undercurrent of smothered
Discontent  burn imprisoning pain
Submerge into my shadow
I'll cover you up with my infinite shadow
This I tell you now
Underneath  the undercurrent of smothered
As I fight the things pulling strings of my life
I'm forcefed by your endless night
Boiling beneath my pale skin
Pulsating inherent craving
Perpetual motion machinery
Inert inside waiting to arise
Infertile piece of perfect bloom
Polluting time bomb ticking for the doom
Walk puppet walk ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ now march forever
Perpetual motion machines running in vain
Sleepwalking its bleak interiors
Soldiers of its dark interiors
Taste their perfect disaster
See your life burning faster
Born mindless freak on a leash
Pawn in the playground of fatal feast
Filling my lungs with your deadening air
Toppled down to crawl up again stair by stair
I'm sick of spilling but black
Marking my warpath with loss and wrath
Blindly deify this intoxicating mirthless divine
Drained luminosity
Condemned to obscurity
Erased feelings and incomprehensible pain
My wounded flesh reflects your intolerable flame
I'm the man that makes you sick
The infectious paralyzing prick
I will feed this repetitive pattern
Until your sanctuary haven shatters
Erased feelings incomprehensible pain
My wounded flesh reflects your intolerable flame
Burn or fade  back to daylight is far away
Dominion of modern bestial sense
Premonition come into existence
Crack the crust to solve the cipher
Mystery radiating indistinct signs
Eyes conceal untouchable fury
Immersing in mind as a burning reverie
Recharging the lights of dismissed memories
Explore the void expand vacuum nothingness
Subliminal disorder beneath the crust
Atonement with a pound of dust
Hooked to its empty shell
Like a precisionguided bomb
Residing in the core and waiting to explode
Creature from a distinct evolution
Breeding idiosyncrasy to revolution
Virus proven cybersoul never alone
Your solitary kingdom is my home
Planet tearing passageways
Hack the ways to your shelter
To cross the burning point
Freeloader of an emptiness
Scaremonger scything completeness
Steering this endless labyrinth
The Psychonaut
He narrates miserable lives like a disease
He stabs you where it hurts the most
And makes you bleed
Weakened to cast own shadow
Sense the feet falling through the ground
Crawl beneath to reflect a mirror
The air is heavy and pressuring down
Red clouds pouring through rapid eye movement
It climbs to the top of your world
To run the engines spitting death and hurts
Retaining the gaze of your God
Residing in the pain that never stops
The Psychonaut
He narrates miserable lives like a disease
He stabs you where it hurts the most
And makes you bleed
Virus proven cybersoul never alone
Your solitary kingdom is my home
Planet tearing passageways
Hack the ways to your shelter
To cross the burning point
Freeloader of an emptiness
Scaremonger scything completeness
Steering this endless labyrinth
Define my conscience what is real
Characterize the ways world disappears
Glittering darkness room by room
Nothing satisfies as I enter bloom
Fear my world so puzzled and mystified
My inability to feel real
Hyperreality feeds me
Falling into my secret window
As I walk the Earth unhallowed
Anything everything
Tricking conscience what I've seen
Detached from engagement of emotions
Meaningless identical devotions
Rapidly taking any given shape
Filtered experience  Depicted in hate
Your demons  my angels
Capsized parallel dream world
Parting ways to breathe to be alive
Crusade of perfect stranger
Disconnect the splendor
Alienations steers 'til the end
Split apart from a faculty of mind
Nonexistent world in a glimpse of an eye
Simulation of something to never exist
This authentic fake  Mind misled
Light years away from here
Hyperspace to escape my fear
Simulation of familiar place
Reproduction of empty appearance
My inability to feel real
Hyperreality feeds me
Falling into my secret window
As I walk the Earth unhallowed
Your demons  my angels
Capsized parallel dream world
Parting ways to breathe to be alive
Crusade of perfect stranger
Disconnect the splendor
Alienations steers 'til the end
Your demons  my angels
Crusade of perfect stranger
I'm sick of spewing my words out
So puzzled that I won't wake up
I'm sick of spewing my words out
So puzzled that I won't wake up
Something has died that once lived inside
Created with a slayconceived spirit
Dispersing from the shades of grey
Blazing through everyone and everything
Inaccurate and rapid moves
Heart beats echo in vacuum
The core scraping pulsation
Thrusting closer to the edge
No escape from myself
This delusion is my shallow grave
In your head in your mind
Emptiness will fill the void
Blood runs still and cold stand at the ruins
Humanity's deserted zone
Bleak sunshine burning to dust
Invisible tissue between us
Lost generation guiding the way
Foreshadowing angels to fall astray
Bloodshot eyes blood painting the world
Adjusting to pain and venom words
This mental masturbation
Breeding progenies of a bastard nation
In your head in your mind
Emptiness will fill the void
Blood runs still and cold stand at the ruins
Humanity's deserted zone
Underneath the empty appearance
The weight of absence so unbearable
Human wasteland sinking quicksand
The Kingdom of Devastation
As I change my shape everything fades
Spirit withers and body turns into a cage
In too deep silence turns to rage
Covering this shallow grave
Stuck in this instant forever
Feelings never to sever
Empty shell within a gunshot
Everything you ever loved has turned to dust
Trivial goals to price your name
Revival of incomplete human race
Every breath reflects a disaster
Intertwined to the limbs  Faking every laughter
In your head in your mind
Emptiness will fill the void
Blood runs still and cold stand at the ruins
Humanity's deserted zone
Underneath the empty appearance
The weight of absence so unbearable
Human wasteland sinking quicksand
The Kingdom of Devastation
As I change my shape everything fades
Spirit withers and body turns into a cage
In too deep silence turns to rage
Covering this shallow grave
Fainting prayers in the street
Painted in these bloodred sheets
Swarming army of paper dolls with scissors
Burn and modify my thoughts take my figure
Condemned to forget forever wandering
My shadow companion is my only friend
We're nothing and everything
The Embodiment of Withering
Descent to the earth wearing unidentified doom
Freezing sun beyond the curtains of black
No escape from falling past the event horizon
Falling empires fading into the landscape
Lost inside escape velocity
Falling in particles fight the lost gravity
Celestial bodies colliding interstellar clouds
Rendering its dense invisible interiors
Morphing to the darker space phenomena
Sucked into a new era
Inflamed world taking stranger turns
Fight the gravity in trembling imbalance
I distort my appearance
Drifting to the void with no soul
Smoke the freedom with your ashes
Grasping widespread warning the day of reckoning
Foredoomed to wander shaken and stranded
Transparent snow globe world
Imbalanced atmosphere shatters
Subdued to explode the host of new life
Appearing from these reptile eyes
The scattering of light
Capture my breath as I plunder away
I the Blind Visitor  the explorer of empty skies
Tormented lives
Worms to a cosmic storms
I diverge from the form
Reformation evolving to cascade
Encroaching inside spreading disease threadbare
Strangler of the universe take and disperse
Warped minds disconnected  Lost in reality
Reprogrammed to forget everything
Hypnotizing circles in the smokescreen
Cycle repeats  Rebirth of a different scene
Weakened breath forming a dark nebula
New dawning of a darker era
Dark kinetic energies invade our souls
Oblivions forming eternal black holes
Drifting to the void with no soul
Smoke the freedom with your ashes
Grasping widespread warning the day of reckoning
Foredoomed to wander shaken and stranded
Transparent snow globe world
Har du gÃÂÃÂ¥tt pÃÂÃÂ¥ mager ljunghed och 
Makterna slukar allt i tystnad
Jag har fyllt mitt hopp med hunger och min 
nÃÂÃÂ¤ring till att forma och att tro
Ett till landskap i ruiner som har 
Det som livnÃÂÃÂ¤rde vÃÂÃÂ¥r socken har 
SÃÂÃÂ¥ plÃÂÃÂ¶tsligt sprack himlen upp 
och fÃÂÃÂ¶r en sekund 
var allt som kallas grÃÂÃÂ¥vÃÂÃÂ¤der 
som bortblÃÂÃÂ¥st 
En mild bris svepte in ÃÂÃÂ¶ver dÃÂÃÂ¤ck 
 en hÃÂÃÂ¤gring frÃÂÃÂ¥n ett hemland 
som jag inte visste fanns 
Till minne av AnnaLisa Persson 19152015
Jag ville veta men fick bara frÃÂÃÂ¥ga 
Where I should go
Should I follow your path or find my own
I know it's time
To decide
To figure out what to do with this life
But can I really be free in your society
Adjust to your norms and your beliefs
Can I be tamed within your frames
Can I be free if I'm in chains
I am the monster you tamed
A beast inside its cage
Now I'm the bitter clown in your play
A proud man drowning in shame drowning in shame
Gave up on my dreams
Sucked down in the flood that is the mainstream
I am the monster you tamed
A beast inside its cage
Now I'm the bitter clown in your play
A proud man drowning in shame
There's something calling deep within me
Begging to be released
I let myself die piece by piece
In your machinery
I've been adapting for so long
It's time I finally got to see
Who's the strong and who's the weak
The beast or the
The beast or the machine
I am the monster you tamed
A beast inside its cage
Now I'm the bitter clown in your play
A proud man drowning in shame
The bitter reminder of all that is gone
A rapid reflection a suffering heart
Somewhere but not here anywhere
State of denial continue leading me wrong
From time to time I catch a glimpse
There is never more than just a glimpse
Existing here beside me now
Faithfully dear periphery
For a fraction of time nerves unwind
The precious moments I live to find
Distracting disrupting disturbing me
The second I feel it it's killing me
From time to time I catch a glimpse
There is never more than just a glimpse
Existing here beside me now
Faithfully dear periphery
Timing lightning  always too late
Fractions flashing for me
Stretching reaching  never enough
Distance approach me now
I can see it there
I see it's there
I believe it is here
Just out of sight
From time to time I catch a glimpse
There is never more than just a glimpse
Existing here beside me now
Faithfully dear periphery
And ignore the entire world
Ignore the fact that I'm a part of this herd
A part of me wants to
Run from my existence shed my skin
I'm running out of persistence
This is a fight I'm never going to win
So I disappear
I become one with the shadows
I step away from the weak and the shallow
Watch me disappear
The life in my eyes was taken long ago
The thoughts in my head once rebellious are dead
I need an exit something to help me
Run from my existence shed my skin
I'm running out of persistence
This is a fight I'm never going to win
So I disappear
I become one with the shadows
I step away from the weak and the shallow
Watch me disappear
Cannot take it cannot take it
Cannot fake anymore
No adjusting no abjection
Cannot adapt to the norm
So I disappear
Disappear I become one with the shadows
I step away from the weak and the shallow
Watch me disappear
This is the mask I wear
A silent surface just to hide my fear
A violence stirring within
Control is caving in
Dark thoughts gathering
Black fog embraces me
Now let the chaos begin
I let the dark inside me
Take control now
So let the dogs behind me
Run me down
For every good thought I think
There are seven dark thoughts
Pounding on the barrier
My endless struggling
To quench the will of sin
It gave me nothing
But an empty void
Red skies descending
Now let the heavens come down
The last light is slowly fading
Dead night is drawing near
Black souls in swift ascending
Closed eyes now open wide
Dim light curtains closed
A silence fills my head
Eyes shut a glimpse of hope
As the needle twists my vein
Pitch black soulless shell
Pure sorrow swept in sin
Dark dreams even darker days
No colors may shine in
Wish I could see the end
Mr Death would you take my pain away
I cannot stand the waiting
Mr Death please lead my soul astray
This broken body is not worth saving
The deep red clears my mind
A thought is taking hold
Black ink against the white
My truth at last be told
Now I'm off to meet the end
Mr Death would you take my pain away
I cannot stand the waiting
Mr Death please lead my soul astray
This broken body is not worth saving
Dim light curtains closed
A silence fills my head
I've seen the death in your eyes
You use consumption as a way of life
I've seen it enter your mind
Like a disease that made you blind and weak
This is what we've become
Robotic mechanical slaves of our own greed
This is the modern humanity
I see excitement in your eyes
You found salvation in an advertise
In a world where everything's for sale
The quest for wealth has replaced the Holy Grail
This is what we've become
Robotic mechanical slaves of our own greed
This is the modern humanity
I've seen this apathy expand
In the air across the seas throughout the land
It's time to wake up
Open your eyes
Souls manufactured and doomed to perfection
This is what we've become
Robotic mechanical slaves of our own greed
This is the modern humanity
We are stuck no new directions
Creators drained of ideas
In the age of constant replacements
When everything's already made
We expand every inch must be covered
Nothing will stand in our way
In the age of the greatest delusions
Everyone's thinking the same
So let your conscience fade now
Cause we can never blame ourselves
Adaption  nowhere in reach
Devastation under our feet
Tempting shape and design
Desperation  our wills collide
Plastic excitement
Craving for more an unstoppable greed
Elastic environment
For how long will you bend the truth
So let your conscience fade now
Cause we can never blame ourselves
Adaption  nowhere in reach
Devastation under our feet
Tempting shape and design
Desperation  our wills collide
A cold wind sweeps across the land
It reminds me that it's time
The last sunset seems ages ago
And the light should have long ago arrived
On this dreadful day
All is silent
Fuel ignites and burns
We are the last to leave
So wave goodbye to the world we know
Mother earth now dies
And taste the shame just for a moment
We stand and watch as rotation stops
See her final spin
Is this the peak of our revolution
Our evergrowing thirst for more
Resulted in decay
Inspiration painted thoughts that common
Sense should have long ago denied and
Thrown away
We turn and look away
As the earth collapses
Her last motion still with grace
Our mother forever laid to rest
I am apart from my equals
Because I know of what's to come
The future holds no sequel and no new dawn
As the light from the halo flows
Betrayal deceit
The ground is shaking underneath your feet
Now watch what I have seen
The markings in the sky deserved and predicted
A proof of our belief
The ending of our time as expected
Beware of the halo
And I see in your blackened eyes
That you would rather become blind
We face the truth from the scenes
That has been haunting me
Now I know what it's all about
Now watch what I have seen
The markings in the sky deserved and predicted
A proof of our belief
The ending of our time as expected
Here in these blank surroundings
At the eye of a perfect storm
There's no excuse no escape no exit
May a constant darkness bury us all
Predictions never lie
Now watch what I have seen
The markings in the sky deserved and predicted
A proof of our belief
The ending of our time as expected
It's a violent whisper
A kind of weightless burden
It's a lonely swim in a crowded ocean
A will to set sail in a dying wind
I hope someday you will find
That glorious moment
A sense of pride
I will stay in my mind
The perfect hideout
Where even life itself cannot get to me
You're a vibrant static
A life within a shell that's dying
You're a constant chained to an endless motion
Courage now swept in a cloak of fear
Too few the answers
Too vague the signs
Too weak resistance
Too true the lies
We seek deliverance and find denial
We seek salvation where faith is blind
I hope someday you will find
That glorious moment
A sense of pride
I will stay in my mind
The perfect hideout
Where even life itself cannot get to me
Waste the endless days
Pondering on how to get away
You're a mask nothing real
Just a piece in a spinning wheel
When you're almost there
It steals your thoughts
Disturbance surrounds you
Then it's gone
In the shades in the weakest of moments
Deep in your doubts full of agony
Don't forget that we're fuel for the engine
And you're nothing but a spoke in the wheel
The same awakening
Strikes your mind every time
It's a shame all this suffering
Like you thought you had a life
Are you closing in
You forgot one thing
That it's a dead end street
Where all the dreamers meet
In the shades in the weakest of moments
Deep in your doubts full of agony
Don't forget that we're fuel for the engine
And you're nothing but a spoke in the wheel
Every day is a repetitive grey
No sharp edges no color no shape
Every day is just a shortterm solution
An endless confusion a longing for escape
Take me somewhere
Far away from this weight I'm under
Save me now release the floods
Wash away what is left of the grey
Every day is an endless delay
I'm just waiting for the barriers to break
Every day I build up more desperation
Increasing frustration about to explode
Take me somewhere
Far away from this weight I'm under
Save me now release the floods
Wash away what is left of the grey
I forgot who I am I forgot where I came from
And where I belong
Take me somewhere
Far away from this weight I'm under
Save me now release the floods
Wash away what is left of the grey
Eyes wide open in here
Sensing there's something wrong with me
And with the room they've put me into
How come I ended up alone
Absent forgotten slowly withering away
Wither away wither away I
Wither away wither
Through black holes I stray
Eyes go blind in here
Wither away wither away I
Wither away wither
Through black holes I stray
Gates closed down all shut down
One city in the center of the universe
The emptiest place ever
There is no room for the righteous
There is no room for man
Veiled inside a dark curtain of insanity
In the agony of deep profound seclusion
The will could never last
In the identity of everlasting structures
The end of all that ever was a cause
All that ever was
A step out of the sunlight
A step out of a small demise
A step into seclusion
To emphasize the point of life
One city in the burning of bright flames
Bright flames for hate of man
Veiled inside a hopeless curtain of insanity
The sun draws a line how scathing divine
My skin turns so pale and feels burning sore
It happens once more
Release me from this guilt
Set me free out of this hell
As anger abates deep sorrow awaits
I'm drained and alone
On the edge of the unknown
On threshold of madness in self denial state
Within a holocause with unlimited rage
A major plan about everything as one
A sad amendment for something long gone
On throne of sickness in self deluded state
The walls are built for the one wasted away
A major need to apply another sore
A cruel fortune an explanation to adore
Oh euphoria
How I long for you
How I crave for you
Tainted all the moments are wasted
Just to really be certain
To rearrange everything
Just to be real
Sometimes it hurts so real it's unreal
Hey I'll gather my thoughts upon another sore
Hey a recreation to another level of man
Hey a recreated man
Breathing breathing
This morning still shadows the night
From depths of the fire this water was born
A moment of hope
A moment of truth
A moment of all that we stand for
From depths of the fire this water was born
This moment bygone still echoes the time
The time when this water was pure
This moment bygone turned earth against earth
All lives turned to matter from mind
From depths of the fire this water was born
Find
A moment of hope
A moment of truth
A moment of all that we stand for
Lest we forget the past
Build once more a sinister monument of pain
Lest we forget
Build once more this sinister monument of pain
Legacy binding us
To fulfil our nature of the beast
Legacy binding us
To unveil the bleakness in our deeds
Since the beginning we have followed
the heart of darkness
Since the beginning we have sworn
by horror and cruelty
It dwells deep inside
Under the fragile surface
Awaiting with teeth bared
In the darkest of corners
Putrid and foul
Gone and wasted inside out
Putrid and foul
Gone and wasted
This is an apocryphon
Concealed inside me
Concealed inside a scenery
Concealed inside me
Concealed inside a scenery
Concealed for the very first time
Concealed inside for a reason why
Concealed for ages to come
This scenery of triumph and loss
Regret remorse
This is hatred inside out
Regret remorse
This is hatred outside in
This is an apocryphon
Truth in redemption's pyre
Scorched out no longer in life
Awaiting these souls on fire
In life there's no brighter side
Once hateful as all its slaves
More fertile than its enemies
Impossible to control
But still a reason for us to live on
Keep away from scarecrows dreams
Dismay feeds all these marionettes
See the truth and manipulation
With lies they breed all these marionettes
Lustre of all that remains is the day
when we all are the same
Adapted to black still on way down
Beyond redemption in a state stronger than hate
Truth over all dreams
Deceit to feed the desolated breed
The point of all that's been done
Is the moment we all are gathered as one
Can not see all this wanton misery
Through the night of shades through the doom
None to see but this wanton elegy
Through the silver tears through the wounds
The sound of place and time
Echoes in chambers nevermore
The one with wounds too deep
Is broken and cast out to the core
A wanton deep for this wanton elegy
Through the element to the core
Forever in disguise this chosen place and time
Earth bound to fire
Fire bound to earth
Matter and substance forlorn in mortal word
I am immortal I am the one
I am the soul in reign
I am the one enslaved beyond decay
Life turned to death
Truth turned to lie
Crumbled the mortal order beyond life
Life bound to death
Truth bound to lie
Crumbled the mortal order manmade lie
Fire and water
Creation and decay
A moment of chance
A moment of cause
When life is torn away
Fire and water
Symptoms without a cause
Polar to death as polar to life
Symptoms define the cause for life
Water bound to fire
Fire bound to water
Matter and substance forlorn in another
I am the wisdom I am the cause
I am as whole in pain
I am the one enthroned beyond decay
Hope with me for this to suffocate now
It is time it is right
It is everything
Hope with me for this to suffocate
Die die die
And born out of fireIs there anything left
Along the dying skyline
Apart from this light which fades
Kissing the world goodbye
At dusk when shadows grow
Behold the shining veil
e secrets kept unfolded
The wind a sigh from the angels
Burden of a meaningless life
Infinite darkness freezes the hearts
Godlike wrath gathering clouds
Nights of pain upon the empty earth
And I drown and I fly
And I'm hearing the wind
And I cry with the clouds
And I'm hearing the past
And I pray I'm away
And I close my eyes
And I stand alone
In a little shrine of clouds
And I drown and I fly
Surrounded by their graves
A fall
A land
A call
A shrine
Running through empty vales
Resting in a shadowed sky
Flying away from the moon
alling and sleeping
In the shrine of fallen clouds
Waving goodbye to the angels
Vanished angels
Never existed
Leaving and keep away from the moon
I don't tell the truth
Remain in the light
And I hold the breath of all those yesterdays
Feel you in my heart
Remain in the light
And I always see the cross of yesterday
Confusion of my soul
This loss my curse
At night I stay awake
I am the guardian of my own hell
Feeding the pyre of lovefilled dreams
The merciless life
Consumed my illusions
I cherish those fairytales
Even though they were never mine
To reach out for peace of mind
Ashes
Ashes glowing in the rain
My ashes
Dead and remain in the light
Frozen fire always burns
And cover my ashes
And the cross of yesterday
A longing without an end
A memory that shall not leave
From time to time
It seems so pointless
That a cruel rage weakens my heart
The fragile silence echoes my pain
Underneath the cross
Protected by its shadow
I gather our old treasures
Delusive haven against myself
Where my ashes always remain
Drowned by this embrace
The shining sky starts to unshape
The pines are moaning as my heart melts
A gentle wind makes the flowers shiver and shake
The sanguine gleams exalt our sorrow
Last hopes are buried still tomorrow
I remember those lonely walks
Along the moors and the vineyards
Desolate bleak orchards
Nature's demise in vivid beauty
Darkness is coming something dies inside
We're all griefstricken by this scenery of night
I just know he's feeling the scars of everything
I just know he's burning all of the grieves
Cold cold cold
End
Come on to the silence
End
I'm dwelling in the light
An unknown light
I just know he's painting a secret on the floor
End
Come on to the silence
End
I'm dwelling in the light
End gathering the angels
End we're dwelling in the light
An unknown light
Like the poisoned scent of my hollow dream
I'm standing alone
While you're vanishing in the sky
I breathe no more
You leave me behind with no words
Moonflower
Your beauty shines over my soul
But I'll never get to you
I didn't know that I would exhaust her soul
And all my memories remain deserted by her
Surrounded by deepened shades
In this place I never belonged
A deadly anguish embracing me
My wishes lost as I drown in fear
And I mourn her loss
In this abyss of gloom
Waiting for a foreseen light not coming back
Feeling its presence as never before
Even though I might never come back
Someone has told me that I was the one
Someone has sworn me I would find the princess
I have seen the light within the darkness
I followed the star that burnt in my soul
Someone has told me that I was the one
Someone has sworn me I would awake her
Blinded by the absent light
Of my beautiful Moonflower
I see those hands you see those hearts
Some are slow to believe
Give me rest from this world
It's going to kill me
Inside I'm falling apart
What will save me
I never knew I was so dead until I met you
It's almost over
Dry these tears from my eyes
Breath in me a new beginning
Never let this love fade away
It's almost over
This is the only thing we're fighting for
We're gonna make it through the night
When all the hope we had is dead and gone
The only way to remain strong
I will never look back
Give me rest from this world
I never new I was so dead until I met you
Give me rest from this world
Set me free from my darkness
We all learn from our failures
I never thought I could fall this far
So far from you
With no desire to look back
Ill embrace this forever
Divorcing my adoration
As death marches to the grave
We all learn from our mistakes let it break me
We all learn from our failures
Failure is death and I have overcome it
With not a single tear of remembrance
I choose to forget and start all over
This was my call to your arms
Sounding silent alarms
Will you love me when you hear me lie
This last time
I've seen a see of change
This fleeting love that leaves me alone
This last time
Lift me now from this pain
You know the way to bring me home
As we die
We've dimmed our lights past darkness
Hiding our way back from this
Swallowing every glimpse of our faithfulness
Who will guide us home when we cannot see
The weak to follow the lead
Its taking over our lives
As we live as we die
I feel it taking over everything inside of me
And I'm losing control
Weakness in my chest
My heart stops beating
Flatlined and I'm in between
This is my struggle
This is emptiness
Closer and closer again
I feel it happening
Holding fast to the hands of grace
I know you're stronger inside stronger than me
Hope walks backwards
My thoughts in reverse
Scream for me I'll hear your voice
My heart knows no other
It's written with your name on it
The aleph is what we stand on
Mirror images of everything
Burning in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
Speaks to me on love's eulogy
It was only a game that you wanted to play
I won't be the same
Say goodbye to all that you hold
I knelt down to kiss you
But you wanted to die in your own arms
You were the one to call me hopeless
You were the one to call me dear
Standing side by side eyes full of fear
I saw the future in a tree outside
There was your heart and there was mine
This love torn apart by every word
Is hopeless love all we have
Is this what we dreamed
I cannot go
Take this heart let it die slow
Tear away from the pain
Tear away from the red
Are we trading in our hearts for emptiness
Is this love or human condition
I close my eyes to see you
Hope is in your name
Where you are I cannot go
Take this heart let it die slow
All the pain that you painted on my face
All those pretty colors on your pallet
Stabbing my chest
With your brush of hopelessness
And this whole time I fell for it
I fell for it
You think you can pull this over my eyes
I can see this without sight
Slowly fade away
I'll walk with my thought
But my heart will always stay
I wish you could have painted a moment
A moment with all sincerity
A moment with all honesty
I can see without sight
I know this is hard for you
This is something I must go through
The first step of the long march
The hardest step we must depart
I will return with more love and more hate
For the distance that makes us separate
Pulling me down past the point of comfort
I wish I could hold her stand with her
And I know it's not over
Every minute is a minute closer
I will come back to hold
'till the day that we grow old
I feel so weightless
Nothing inside is keeping me grounded
My selfdecay brings tears to my eyes
Fingerprints of the dead
Descend on my window
I feel it's all I see
I feel it's breaking me
Haunting words of emptiness
I'm not afraid so take me
I feel it's breaking in me
I'm not afraid to take me
I'm dead inside so save me
As a new campaign marches across the dead
In uniform with one vision
Delivering our children
Each step making a sound of reason
Breaking and burning caskets
Marching across the dead
As I turn my face two ways
Take a hold
There can be no hesitation
Tonight I must fight
This won't be long
I will meet you when I'm strong
Ashes in my eyes bring scars of deception
Blinded I am forgive me
Forgive me for I was wrong
There can be no hesitation
Take my hand
There can be no regrets
Take this blindfold from me
The darkest words the darkest thoughts
You left me know
I'm so lost
How can this pain be taken away
How can this be in your own name
I swear even the dead want you alive
One last kiss as we say our goodbyes
Save us from ourselves
Save us we need you know
Bury me with you and never let my hand go
I'll think of you forever
I'll sing melodies over your grave
Songs of remembrance
And the lives you saved
I'll think of you forever
When we meet again
Will you still have the loving skeleton
Wake the master
Is all you survey
Pictures down the well of my thoughts
In settled dust they're hidden away
God were you sleeping something feels so strange
I open doors never chosen for me
Lost my sense of reality
Now I'm free like a rat in a cage
Sleeping God You're a stranger to me
Sands will sift away our time slips away
Down in the deep black hole of my heart
I feel the pain inside of the dreams that died
Forever burn this world it's far too late
Now I stare out my window I see the towers rise 
Toxics seep into my backyard before my very eyes
Industrial revolution no other solution
For the junk cultured junkies needs
So  take a deep breath because it ain't over yet
Dollar for dollar the business hounds holler 
Sour mouthed stomachs well fed
And I'm moving the game yet I still complain
The paranoia it swells inside my head
How will I ever know which way the wind blows 
To tear off my hide defenseless rich or poor
When the wolves start gathering round my door
Selfdestructed I never anticipated
Such pain from the things that I've created
Burn down the lies and the hatred in my eyes
Let it burn burn to see the world turn
And it's all there in front of me
And I feel compelled to make you seereality
This is reality
Fractured chess game knights move
Chaos no point to prove
I've been changing my open mind
Self defensive intentions you'll never find
Deviation detour your moral code
You Understand I refuse to play the role
Say have a seat I think I'll stand
Stained glass here I come with brick in hand
No explanations for my deviation
I'll give no explanation for my deviation
See me are you surprised
I symbolize all you despise
Never never your faithful pawn
You run your rat race it's that I spit upon
No explanations for my deviation
I'll give no explanations for my deviation
No explanation for my deviation
What was it something that I realized
A need inside me took me by surprise
I see two sides now I just don't know
Subjected now an addict of control
Mirror yourself if you can even try
Gaze deep into God's sleepy eye
Arabesques in my cold burn freeze
Deliverance upon my dirty knees
Dominator life's blood my need
The balance in my hands the life blood seed
Ooh my October thorns in my side
It makes me wonder will the need subside
You miscalculated the algebra of need
You've come to learn junkie of control
The more you push the stuff the more it flows
Twist the plot of demand supply
A grim reflection of both you and I
Now I know just who you really are
I realized just who I really am
Now I now just who I really am
Me outside my window me inside my door
Inside or outside I don't give a fuck no more
Say I'm angry have a lousy attitude
Pretentious asshole time to move aside
Can't survive on your hypocrisy and lies
You're building up but you're tearing down
Indifference to my fellow man no longer amused
Just pissed off and confused still I laugh
And I'm so fucking happy
The promise cast the hopeful lured
Stabbing by the pointed words
Tortures of the damned you'll find
Guilt preys upon the human mind
All you know and all you feel
Is all there is and all that's real
Innocent told you're a worthless pain
Eventually drives all insane
Bleak optimism gained 
A lame excuse to hide the pain
Instinct stifled be ashamed
For what you feel is right and sane
Suffering told what you feel and need is wrong
When conflicting with the machine
The machine that's run so long
Suffer the masses contradicting views inside
Suffer the masses the personality divides
Suffer the masses what's told and what you know
Suffer the masses now now the neuroses grows
Generations handed down
The false smile to hide your frown 
Instinct stifled don't be afraid
For what you feel is right and sane
The promise cast the hopeful lured
Stabbed by the pointed words
Tortures of the stabbed you'll find
As guilt devours your broken mind
Doing the descend I've been waiting
To step into a dream
It is it was it seems
Satan in your stereo crucifix receptacle
Menace in your muddy eyes a candy coated fear
Do I remember me transcending partisan
Hunter and hunted now one in the same
Vast delirium multitudes of attitude
TV is your brain
Vile greasy vermin nicotine scars
Cheap lethal bourbon my refuge in the bar
Open mind defended seen through a filtered lens
Stigmatised in my holy  water 666
Is it threatening as it seems
Sometimes there's nothing left to tell
Sometimes I can't understand myself
No no single key to calculated spontaneity
Confusion illusion
What use sanity
Battering down the walls built inside of me
Battering down
Passing me through revolving doors
Your will whole of the law
Doors in your mind unwind unwind
Symbol in your muddy eyes words are dismissable
Nothing is true all is permissible
Open mind defended seen through a filtered lens
Sometimes There's nothing  left to tell
Sometimes I can't understand myself
No no single key to calculated spontaneity
Confusion illusion
What use sanity
Battering down the walls built inside of me
Battering down the walls built inside of me
Battering down
Greed can't wash your filthy hands
Now you know Just where you really stand
Competition Man against man
Vicious players Game of life has no plan
Candiate for office You vote for me
Promises promises Just another vote
What do you really want What will you pay
To stab another back To get your way
You try to rip me off I'll bring you down
Kill Or be killed that's what we're all taught
Money drugs religion they've all got their plots
To make it to the big time then pay off the cops
To get your own way you were my friend 
You've cut the bloodline that never ends
Innoculations for the benefit of all mankind
A human guinea pig I've laid my life on the line
I didn't plan on this misery this drastic change
Organ donor before my death what a foolish risk
Masochistic nausea I can't chase away
Transforming my life is fading away
Blood cells mutating in unnatural ways
Hair is receding my skin turns to scales
Genetic imbalance of selfinduced hell
Distort the tissue to create the strain
Biological warfare is their f*$#*g game
I've paid the price the naive accessory
Cash mutated I am no longer me
Transforming my life is fading away
Blood cells mutating in unnatural ways
Hair is receding my skin turns to scales
Genetic imbalance from selfinduced hell
No immunization no antidote to sell
Genetic imbalance from selfinduced hell
Stare up into the sky who's in charge
Forces of nature  destiny control 
Even the rich can't buy their lives 
When death becomes her toll
No conscience no love a heartless dare
No matter where you hide she's there
Rape the land bite the hand that feeds you
One day gonna take it away
Feel the chill from her icy stare
No self control it will take its toll
The life we're living here
We kill the creatures she creates
Then we wonder why she cries
We kill the creatures she creates 
Then we wonder why she cries
Mass operation or daddy's cash
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath
Well I've said it before and I'll say it again
You get nothin' for nothin' expect it when
It's easy to go along with the crowd
And find later on that your say ain't allowed
So I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothin' to lose at all
I'm goin' to do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall
You can hang in a left or hang in a right
The choice it is yours to do as you might
The road is open wide to place your biddin'
Now wherever you turn wherever you go
If you get it wrong at least you can know
There's miles and miles to put it back together
And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothin' to lose at all
I'm goin' to do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall
Makin' a curve or takin' the strain
On the decline or out on the wane
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later
We'll put it to rights we'll square up and mend
Back on your feet to take the next bend
You weather every storm that's comin' at 'tcha
And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothin' to lose at all
I'm goin' to do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall
Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to bend the arrow out of line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
Grinder  looking for the meat
Grinder  wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies on my scene this boy won't get caught
Refuse to bait the man trap
Be left to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere
Grinder  looking for meat
Grinder  wants you to eat
I have my licence
It came with birth
For self reliance of this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched to file me in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
On the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breath
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave
Grinder  looking for meat
Grinder  wants you to eat
Grinder  looking for meat
Grinder  wants you to eat
You mesmerize slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
You're possessing me
Atrocities
Made every day
Religiously
Their sins
They hide
Can never disguise
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies
They wage their wars
Such profiteers
Will nail us all
Their crimes
Concealed
Despicably reveal
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained lies
They fire at will
Intent to kill
They have no conscience
They have no conscience
Ethnic cleansing nothing more
Blood of nations blood of war
Turn blind eyes
From all your crimes
You bare our souls
Show no remorse
You cannot wash
The bloodstains off
They turn their backs
While others
Commit grisly acts
We're scared
For life
By politicians' greedy
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained crimes
Blood stained lands
Blood stained minds
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies
And while such predators
Stalk this earth
Disguised as saints
They kill our faith
Obsessed by greed
Lying through their teeth
They cannot wash
The blood stains off
Don't you know you're driving me insane
You're tryin' to find your way through life
You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman got her man
She won't find no new connection
You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to find some new
Another woman's got her man
But she won't find a new
You 'bin foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up get out you know you really blew it
Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mineshe was mine
Changes changes changes changes
Victim of changes
Along deserted avenues
Steam begins to rise
The figures primed and ready
Prepared for quick surprise
He's watchin' for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the Sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins
Sending out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the Sentinel
Amidst the upturned burnedout cars
The challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars
With which to seal his fate
Across his chest is scabbards rest
The rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests
Have finished many lives
Now facing one another
The standoff eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls
As the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers
With shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets
Upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony
Rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies
Blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless
Impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory
And the seeds of death he's sown
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the Sentinel
I am your darkest hour
I am your fall from power
I am the voice you dread and I'm
Screaming out inside your head
I am the final count
I am your demons out
I am the worst demise
I'm gonna cut your words down to size
What is this
I hear you shout
Face to face
I'm gonna take you out
One on One
Bring it on
One on One
Take me on
I am the awful truth
I am the fearless youth
I am the cross to bear
And the one who dares to return your stare
I am the fist of God
I am the underdog
I'll always stand my ground
While the others scatter all around
Against all odds
Despite it all
I'm at my best when I'm against the wall
I am the bloodstained past at last
That's finally caught up with you like
The glint of steel from out of the dark the last
Thing you will feel  I'm outgunned I'm out
Run I'm undead and then I found the skin
You shed  I am the questions asked
That send shivers down your back
So I am holding out
And I'm much stronger now
So take me on
I am the darkest night
I am the vipers strike
I'll see you all consumed
As you start to lick
Your mortal wounds
Like the condemned man
Who just won't die
I'll show no remorse
I'll never walk away
I move as fast as I can
I like to get around
I'm crazy like a madman
My feet don't touch the ground
I move amongst the night life
And they just step aside
Cause when they see me coming
They know I'm running wild
Dead or alive there's nothing
That bothers me at all
I take on all comers
They back off or they fall
They raise their hands to stop me
I laugh and I defy
Cause what's the point in living
Unless you're living wild
No chains can hold me down
I always break away
I never hear society
Tell me what to do or say
I taste the life that pleases me
And raise a storm for all the world to see
I never stumble never fall
Never stop for rest
I rebel but I walk tall
And I demand respect
I move amongst the nightlife
And they just step aside
Cause when they see me coming
They know I'm running wild
I'm running wild
I'm running wild
Get outta my way
I'm running wild
I'm running wild
You better believe it
You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack
I smile when I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper
You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if I'm near
I'm sly and I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for The Ripper
Or if you like Jack The Knife
Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream of the fright
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripperthe ripperthe ripper
I'll be damned here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here I sit hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Headed straight for a fall
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds Diamonds and Rust
They are dying on the dance floor
They are lying in debris
They are fading with exhaustion
From the mortal injuries
They are hungry and need feeding
They've resigned themselves to fate
They are desperate men
Death's written on their face
When your will to live
Is all but gone
And you're left alone
But you need someone  feed on me
Feed on me
They're outgunned and they're outnumbered
But they'll never turn to run
And the 'in name of freedom's'
Written with their blood
Some would call them mercenary
But they always knew the pain
Inevitably far outweighs the gain
Feed on me
Feed on me if you need to breath
Feed on me
When your hunger strikes you down again
Feed on me
Feed on me  I got what you need
Feed on me
Feed on me  don't accept defeat
They aredying on the dance floor
They are lying in debris
They are fading with exhaustion
From the mortal injuries
Some would call them mercenary
But they always knew the pain
Enevitably far outweighs the gain
When your will to live has almost gone
And you're left alone and you need someone
Feed on me
Feed on me
Feed on me
Feed on me  I got what you need
Feed on me
Feed on me  don't accept defeat
Can't believe that she needs my love so bad
Come sneaking around trying to drive me mad
Just taking my love and slip away
He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand
Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you
Withdrawn he'd sit there
Stare blank into space
No sign of life
Would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled
It seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him
Goodbye  and then he died
Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for livin' in
Yeah I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever
And ever but I'll still win
How many like him
Are there still
But to us all
Seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands
Plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost
Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
It's not fit for livin' in
Beyond the realms of death
Speak to me
Of those days I won't forget
Your worst dreams
Has just returned  to pay you back
I'm still laughing
There's not much else I can do
But one's thing's certain
I'm coming back for you
Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who you used it on
You're going to burn in Hell
Die
Why
Time to pay the price
Kill
I will
Have my sacrifice
Plead
With fear
I am getting near
Friend
Liar
Time to eat some fire
Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in Hell
Burn in Hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in Hell
You are going to blister
Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in Hell
Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell
Snarl like a dog
You'll scream like a banshee
Stuck like a hog
You're gonna love me
Burn in Hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in Hell
You are going to blister
Burn in Hell
Screaming like a banshee
Burn in Hell
Burn
You're looking at me why
Sort of like a leper vibe
Okay for your kind
But it's too good for me
And a hey I know I'm
Never gonna qualify
For all the bullshit
Of your social degrees
Oh look down your noses at me
Hating my identity
Oh but that don't mean a damn thing you see
'Cause down here in hell everybody loves me
Hey I know I'm antisocial
'Cause you act like I'm infected
With some atrocity
And though I know I'm
Every bit the same inside
My face don't fit
It's like I've got some disease
Oh you keep your face turned away
To strip me of identity
Oh still got my fortune and fame
'Cause down here in Hell everyone knows my name
Hell is home to me
Might as well be
I like it here and noone else invited me
Hell is home to me
It has to be 'cause Jesus Christ
Nobody else invited me
Now I belong
I found my home
'Cause even though I know things won't
Say my whole life I've always been disliked
Ignored unless you're spitting insults at me
And I don't know why you felt so justified
In all the degradation that you dished on me
Oh Now my status has changed
And you've got yourself to blame
Oh I'll grab all the attention I crave
feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
So much for the golden future I can't even start
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law
Full moon is rising
The sky is black
I need your call I'm coming back
The road is straight cast
Wind's in my eyes
The engine roars between my thighs
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
Wild mountain thunder
Echoes my quest
My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams my heart it bleeds
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight I said I'll never get enough
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You got another thing comin'
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
At top aint room for second best
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
You won't hear me But you'll feel me
Without warning something's dawning listen
Then within your senses
You'll know you're defenceless
How your heart beats when you run for cover
Your cant retreat I spy like no other
Then we race together We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
Love machines in harmony we hear the engines cry
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
You don't know I'm there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Electric eye in the sky
Feel my stare always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Protected Detective Electric eye

Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one AM loaded loaded
I'm all geared up to score again loaded loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
Ready to take on every deal loaded loaded
My pulse is racing I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up fit to break
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric sparkin' power loaded loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour loaded loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
Seek him here seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams From a streak of fire as he strikes
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Black as night faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition of sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams Crash one by one to the ground
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather

In a world of confusion and pain
We will need a leader again
He will come and bring us home
And will see that all evil is gone
Even though our kingdom can die
We must try to hold our heads high
Now the time will come for us
Make a stand and fight for our king
There will be another time for us
Our kingdom will grow strong
In the power of our king power of our king
We will fight and never die
He's the keeper of our ring keeper of our ring
For us he is divine
In the power of our king power of our king
We will fight and never die
He's the keeper of the ring
For us he is divine
In these times when tyranny rules
Killing heroes saints and fools
They are slain by the reign of blood
Sacrifice for the unholy god
From the masses a man will rise
He will point his sword at the skies
All the evil will tremble with fear
Because they know that the end is near
There will be another time for us
Our kingdom will grow strong
In the power of our king power of our king
We will fight and never die
He's the keeper of our ring keeper of our ring
For us he is divine

He's the keeper of the ring
For us he is divine
We all started one morning
Scientists with a mission
A journey to the unknown
Looked so good felt so right
I remember it so clearly
Technology will save us
But the machines started shaking
Began to dissolve We fall apart
It's all in the Eye of the Beholder
As we dissolve in dimensions of life
We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empires Rise
Visions of Fate and Future ahead
Remember all the Promises
The Power and the Glory
Of our Quest of humanity
Looked so good felt so right
I remember it so clearly
We were the best of the best
But we could not prevent it
Living as ghosts not really dead
It's all in the Eye of the Beholder
As we dissolve in dimensions of life
We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empires Rise
New visions of Fate and Future ahead
We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empire Fall
Vanishing fragments in Sea of Lies
Am I a man or am I a Machine
Am I the Redeemer or was I the Saviour
I am the new Alpha  Omega
But who Created Me
Lord help me now
Lord hear me scream
Fading apart
I'm losing my mind
We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empires Rise
New visions of Fate and Future ahead
We are the Travellers in Time
Man made machines now machines make men
See the Empire Fall
Vanishing fragments in Sea of Lies
Screams in the night the beast has risen again
Screams of fear the beast has no mercy to men
Live or just Die by the Code of Conduct
Divine Justice is my Holy Revenge Beware
I do not fear the Beast's bloodstained path
All my guns are blazing in the dark night
Another beast has been condemned to Hell
I'm alone in this dark world
Its me my guns and my trusted wolf
I am the Slayer
The Chaser of unholy prey
I'm alone in this dark world
It's me my guns and my trusted wolf
I can not die yet
Until my quest is fulfilled
Beast slayer
Beast slayer
The blood red moon witness my holy search
And then I stand Eye to Eye with the Beast
The Fight was Brutal but I burned him alive
All their victims can now rest in peace
All my guns are blazing in the dark night
Another beast has been condemned to Hell
I'm alone in this dark world
It's me my guns and my trusted wolf
I am the Slayer
The Chaser of unholy prey
I'm alone in this dark world
It's me my guns and my trusted wolf
I can not die yet
Until my quest is fulfilled
Beast slayer
Beast slayer
All my guns are blazing in the dark night
Another beast has been condemned to Hell
Hell Hell Hell
I'm alone in this dark world
It's me my guns and my trusted wolf
I am the Slayer
The Chaser of unholy prey
I'm alone in this dark world
It's me my guns and my trusted wolf
I can not die yet
Until my quest is fulfilled
Beast slayer
Beast slayer
Beast slayer
Beast slayer
Never ending nightmares Echoes of the past
He escapes his reality with Prozac n' novocaine
And refuses to remember his search for peace
Fading pictures on his bedroom wall
Memories from the hidden past
Remaining dreams in an endless Fall
He will never ever rise
Wolfcry now he's coming after you
Wolfcry I am fearing the night
Wolfcry and there is nothing I can do
Wolfcry I am fearing the night
He used to live alone hiding in the ruins
In wars without a cause deadly sniping enemies
Hailed as a Warrior but then the war was over
Fading pictures on his bedroom wall
Memories from the hidden past
Remaining dreams in an endless Fall
He will never ever rise
Wolfcry now he's coming after you
Wolfcry I am fearing the night
Wolfcry and there is nothing I can do
Wolfcry I am fearing the night
Fading pictures on his bedroom wall
Memories from the hidden past
Remaining dreams in an endless Fall
He will never ever rise
Wolfcry now he's coming after you
Wolfcry I am fearing the night
Wolfcry and there is nothing I can do
Wolfcry I am fearing the night
All your life you've been walking the road
The road of the poor
You will do whatever it takes
To make it all shine
Wanna be rich and famous
Wanna be Mr Gold
Doesn't matter what it costs
Your life is on loan
Searching searching you are never pleased
Going going and you're never going back
Gone for gold  search across the land
Gone for gold  treasure's in your hand
Mr Gold  future lay ahead
Mr Gold  so you find it or be dead
Yes it seems that you can do
Whatever it takes
To make your own world good
Never ashamed
But when you reach your final goal
And all is fine
You will stand there all alone
Alone in the world
Searching searching you are never pleased
Going going and you're never going back
Gone for gold  search across the land
Gone for gold  treasure's in your hand
Mr Gold  future lay ahead
Mr Gold  so you find it or be dead
I am Mr Gold
Searching searching you are never pleased
Going going and you're never going back
Gone for gold  search across the land
Gone for gold  treasure's in your hand
Mr Gold  future lay ahead
Mr Gold  so you find it or be dead
Tell me the promise of Fortune and Fame
Tell me how come it ends all the same
Tell me the story of young and the old
While we bleed to death this morning so cold
Cowards that hide in the Shadows of Greed
Attack in the night our brethren in need
We will strike back in the final frontier
The taste of Revenge is so sweet and so clear
If battle is for Glory
Tell me how tell me when will this pain ever end
If battle is for Glory
Tell me how tell me when will this pain ever end
We fight together in this battlefield of Hell
We live forever we are the Brothers in arms
We will never surrender to unholy light
Tell me the reasons why you can't stop lying
Tell me how come that we all ha'e just die
Tell me the truth or has it been sold
While we bleed to death in this morning so cold
Vultures will feast on all those who will die
Pile of corpses beneath the red Sky
In rage we attack 'cause glory is near
The taste of Revenge is so sweet and so clear
If battle is for Glory
Tell me how tell me when will this pain ever end
If battle is for Glory
Tell me how tell me when will this pain ever end
We fight together in this battlefield of Hell
We live forever we are the Brothers in arms
We will never surrender to unholy light
We fight together in this battlefield of Hell
We live forever we are the Brothers in arms
We fight together to bitter end we will fight
We will never surrender to unholy light
Out in the night the wind blows so cold
The moon lights my way I wanna go home
I scan the horizon the Shore is so far
The body is weakening I stare at the stars
There is lightning and there's pain
You feel fire in your brain
There is nothing you can do
For the beast will come for you
Something is moving beneath my cold feet
I'm trying to move but I'm all too scared
A terrible burst of pain in my leg
The beast took a bite soon I am dead
There is lightning and there's pain
You feel fire in your brain
There is nothing you can do
For the beast will come for you
I am so frightened and alone
I am a million miles from home
How can it be it must be wrong
Is a threat to us and the world
Lies
We are betrayed
Can this be wrong
Is this the End
Rapid Fire  waking you up in the night
Rapid Fire  terror of death rules the fight
Rapid Fire  it wakes you up and you cry
Rapid Fire  I hear the screams of those who die
Their way of greed makes us die
They're sending people to the grave
No it makes me wanna scream
For them to fight their wars
Lies
We are betrayed
Can this be wrong
It must the End
Rapid fire  waking up in the night
Rapid fire  terror of death rules the fight
Rapid fire  it wakes you up and you cry
Rapid fire  I hear the screams of those who die
Rapid fire fire Fiiire Rapid Fire
Rapid fire  waking up in the night
Rapid fire  terror of death rules the fight
Rapid fire  it wakes you up and you cry
Rapid fire  I hear the screams of those who die
Rapid fire  waking up in the night
Rapid fire  terror of death rules the fight
Rapid fire  it wakes you up and you cry
Rapid fire  I hear the screams of those who die
Never afraid alone we stand strong
Our Brothers in Arms make us go on
Keepers of Faith will never let go
Stronger and stronger we grow we will explode
We follow the road in an unbroken line
We go where nobody dares
A legacy strong was born to this world
By us the Brothers of Steel
We make our own way they can't put us down oh no
'Cause we are aligned all over the world
The fire within will always burn bright
We will never give up let's carry on

That we are unique we're one of a kind

A legacy strong was born to this world
By us the Brothers of Steel
The eternal flames of metal
Living in our hearts
It never dies

The eternal flames of metal
Burning in our hearts
It never dies
The flames will live forever
This is the palce where I'm inside
Let me show how you must feel
A magic circle of dilght
No need to think just join us
This is a prison of desire
We're slaves of love
I wish it was our world 
Enter to paradise
Come enjoy with us the life
Welcome to our home
Come with us and
Forget all the things

That don't let you see you're free
Enter to paradise
Come enjoy with us the life
Welcome to our home
Come with us and
Forget all the things 
That don't let you see you're free 
Like your dry leaves
What will your dreams become
If your shine and beauty disappears
Who was the love who could
Not feed your roots
Who is the gardener
Who has sown this field full of death trees
What do you feel
When you open your leaves
To all those poor men
You need this to value yourself
Cause you're empty
Are you sure that this is the life you want to
Live
Yes you come here this night will be special
one and also your last regret
You are a lonely man who lost his course
Don't believe this night will be a special one
Don't listen to his voice
Don't listen to him you know that
Why don't you accept this is your condition
You have no choice your roots don't let you move
And I'm not going to fall into your clutches
This is not your condition
You have a choice 
Your life is only yours
Don't listen to him
You have a choice
Cause I understand now that my life is led
Astray is not my way
Could nocturnal flowers see a new dawn
Can they believe in themselves
And restart
What do you feel
When you open your leaves
To all those poor men
You need this to value yourself
Cause you're empty
Are you sure that this is the life you want to
Live
You know I'm dead
There is no blood now in my veins
Once I was fire
Today I'm dust
Is this my defeat
No I am sure you/I will return to life 
Can you hear my breath in your neck
I hope your remorse won't left you live in peace
You made me realize I was a deceit
A science's whim the progress lust 
Don't you know who I am
I can feel I can taste
My world's the same world you're living in
I'm not a cell your experiment
Don't you see me cry 
How many years have you wasted making me
Only a few minutes to destroy your work
Full of pain full of grace yeas I reproach you
For my disgrace for all my tears 
I would like to know
What you wanted yo do with me
At least tell me my sadness has been useful 
Don't you know who I am
I can feel I can taste
My world's the same world you're living in
I'm not a cell your experiment
Don't you see me cry
New era is here waiting for me
A new reality will appear are you ready for a
New life
Our revolution's going to start
Come with us prepare the future are you ready
For the new life 
A new life has just began
I vae learnt to live
And I just want to keep this feeling
If I could stop time
And catch it with my fingers
I would fly 
And I could start my revolution
My heart against the world
I am going to find my own solution
My own war 
Don't you think that it's enough
Don't you see the tears of the earth
Our mother's crying
We all are accomplices of disaster
And of hate 
You cannot stop my revolution
My heart against the world
I am just finding my own solution
It's my war 
New era is here waiting for me
A new reality will appear are you ready for a
New life
Our revolution's going to start
Come with us prepare the future are you ready
For the new life 
A new life has just began
It's my turn it's time for changes
The present will become the past
New era is here
To take us on a long trip
To my dreams 
At kast I've started my revolution
My heart against the world
Here you are this is my own solution
My new war
Don't disguise your emotions
Cause I know what you think
I vae a sixth sense that
You could not imagine 
I know what you're thinking
In every moment of your life
I can see beyond your eyes
Every time you look the mines 
Why don't you say things straight to me
Lies beyond your sight
Icy pupils freezing our eyes
This will be the end
Of the knowing glance we had 
Do you want to blind me
What kind of trick will you use
Are you going to dare me
Do you think I'll believe you 
Your truth is in disguise
Behind all those cunning lies
You fling them as daggers
What is happening with us 
WWhy don't you say things straight to me
Lies beyond your sight
Icy pupils freezing our eyes
This will be the end
Of the knowing glance we had
If I only could erase all my memories
And begin another time to live
I would turn my heart into steel
I feel living is so painful
That I think I can't go on
It kills me 
Cause your soul still lingers here
In my dreams in me 
How to find my way
How to get the strength
How to feel that I'm alive
I wonder why can't go away with you
I must be strong
I feel all alone 
If I one could stop
The blank that grows in my mind
Sending flowing tears away
From here 
How to find my way
How to get the strength
How to feel that I'm alive
I wonder why can't go away with you
I must be strong
I feel all alone 
I will go on loving you
Until the end
Of time
Even though you're gone
I will bring up the dead to eat the living
If thou openest not the gates to the dark
The dead will outnumber the living
Seven doors to the underworld
I come from an old lineage
They were a powerful race
They lived in hidden mountains
In deserts flatness and seas
And she could not return
Then she passed back through the seven gates
My forbears were removed
But you see I am still here
Prepared to call the spirits
Prepared for the ancient rite
They destroys all our dreams
In the name of a strange force
The fire they used against us will return
But this time against them
They destroyed all our live
We can not forget
Although we are just the past
We've return with her
Come with me dark creatures of the night
Come with me tonight
I can do all that we need to
I'm the strongest witch
I am the last soul of my folk
The last chance to revenge for the pain
I will defy the death
I am the avenging angel
They call me Queen of the night
I am the eternal nightmare
For all those who know my name
The queen of war and the queen of love
This is me
The new legend is here
There's so much you'll never know
Cause you think our life it's so short
There're so many place to see
And no time to realize your dreams 
Over the hills under the sky
Feel the sun touch the snow and smell the
Rain 
Feel the freedom spread your wings and fly
Away 
Close your eyes and try to see
Far horizons so far away from here
Look at the shadow of my wings
Can you imagine the lands they have been in 
Over the hills under the sky
Feeling the sun touching the snow smelling
The rain 
I know you feel a slave of routine
You watch the sky fly over me
You want to be like me
You can do all that you want
It's not only a dream
Why don't you break
Your crystal wall 
It's just the time to realize your dreams
Over the hills under the sky
Feel the sun touch the snow and smell the
Rain 
You are the only one who can decide
Feel the freedom spread your wings and fly
Away
I try to understand the message
Of the other side
but I cannot see anything
Cause everything is dark
the Echoes of the blank
Are booming in my head 
Once and again
Release me from them 
Does anybody know the meaning of our lives
Are you frightened of the hard reality 
What is beyond in eternity
Is there a new life
What is beyond infinity 
Make this voice stop shouting
I cannot stand his wail
Here you have the sign of weakness
The sign of human's fears
You do want an answer
What would you like to hear
The only thing in my mind prophesies
Is that your end is here 
Does anybody know the meaning of our lives
Are you frightened of the hard reality 
What is beyond in eternity
Is there a new life
What is beyond infinity
Obscuritas nemoris
Obscuritas in abyssis 
Shut up
Don't disturb their dreams
Shut up
Or you will stay with them forever 
Drops of black water fall down
Wetting the dry trees
Of this forest
Where the souls of sorrow sleep
Since the sun appears
That's the punishment for all their sins
Streams of blood nourish this land
And the frozen wind
Freezes everything that was alive 
At least I can breathe the stillnes I wanted
I feel myslef reborn from the ashes 
Don't be afraid of darkness
We come from it and we'll go there
Moon can be our new sun
Silence will be our best ally
Don't be afraid of darkness
We come from it and we'll go there 
nobody can ruffle our calm
This is the shelter of dead souls
We have no bonds out of this place 
What is heaven and what Hell
What is life and death
In my forest
Far away from happiness
Far away from pain
Only silence only peace 
Obscuritas nemoris quae omnia penetras
Nos omns in abyssis custodias
Salus nostra quies nostra tu es
Defende nos in proelio
Contra nequitiam
Et insidias diaboli
Esto praesidium 
imperet illi Deus
Supplices deprecamir
Tuque princeps militiae
Militiae coelestis 
In the beginning of time
There was a great war
The prince of light against Belial 
he kept the way of the tree of life
The gate of paradies
Provoking the rage of the most lovely angel
Of night 
I'll ascend to heaven
I will raise my throne
Above the stars of God
I will ascend to the tops of the clouds
I will make myslef like the most high 
You were cast out of heaven
Where you'll never come back to
You were cut down to the ground
Light bringer you were brought low
*Lucifer qui mane oriebaris* 
You cannot win this battle now
Jealous angel surrender
Stop shedding blood
Jealous angel surrender 
No mercy 
You've lost this fight
And heaven has lost one of his sons
You have now what you wanted
You are now your orn God in hell
A thief of souls 
You refused our love
It really hurts me
You were my brother
But I won't have mercy
Cause the fight has started 
He was not strong enough
His place in heaven was lost
His ambition hurled him down 
Since then he has been flying
Above the abyss
With his host of angels
Among the dark clouds 
Please show me the way
Don't let me fade into the darkness of hell
Why did he choose the other side
He decided to betray us 
Defende nos in proelio
Contra nequitiam
Et insidias diaboli
Esto praesidium 
Satanam aliosque
Spiritus malignos
Qui ad perditionem
Animarum pervagantur in mundo
nothing like mine
don't waste your time and try to save me
did you think Did you think there was more
comes back around
call
dull boy into a monster
Panic subsides as you're forced to accept
Take what you can when nothing remains
Shed all your tears they're doing the same
Plan and decide that it's time to destroy us
Welcome the end out of spite for your pain
Eradicate commiserate annihilate
This fucking world is over
As if face to face with a god
I never thought I'd see the day
Flames erasing everything that we've done
I never thought I'd get away
Justice on earth just in case nothing follows
May the creatures you tortured deny you of flesh
Oceans and tides will swallow your goals
Compassion for few contempt for the rest
They should have listened but soon they will see
Searching for years it's right in your face
Driven by questions teased by your fate
The meaning of life turns out to be nothing
Careless loss of dreams
Dreams that never breathe
Moments in which I obsess
You don't know the things I'm thinking
Glimpses of yesterday
Throw them all away
Distractions that hold me back
You don't know the things I'm thinking
You don't know the things I'm thinking
You haven't got the slightest clue of who I am
Jealous bitterness
Once whole now emptiness
Always surrounding me
You don't know the things I'm thinking
Deaf blind and dumb they all are
Fill me with righteous moods
Tempted to obliterate
Save your praises for another day
Nothing was achieved today
Victory is overrated
Holding on to memories as they fade
Watch yourself you're too nostalgic
You might lose your goddamn mind
I should know I should know
You might lose your goddamn mind
Nothing No one No love Ever
I tried to communicate
Try to affiliate
No love equals hate
Even amongst rejects I'm a fucking reject
Grab on to desires
I am an anomaly
Crippling anxiety
Innocently watching all you take for granted
Changes never mattered
Cursed from the start with nothing
No one
No love
Ever
Fuck you
Chronic this solitude is chronic
I torture myself every day and night
Over what I can't have
Insanity
No love
No one
Ever
No belief in fate falling further away
Tempting thoughts are surreal
Time erases not all wounds I'm walking proof
You don't always reap what you sow
Nothing to see no one to hold
Can't ever be with you
No one better push me lest you're ready die
And now I'm willing to die
That means you too
Spent my whole life preparing for death
In wastelands of hatred when I am denied
To change the way I think about you
Can't change the way I feel these days
I've changed by guarantee of certain doom
Slay the want to feel falling further away
Disconnected I'm cold
Time erases not all wounds I'm walking proof
You don't always reap what you sow
Attitudes change morphing by certitude
Yet people remain the same
Be more responsibleÃÂ 
Well what about you
Don't test me now
There is no going back
Yeah sure I'm irresponsible
Not you right
This obsession I cannot hide
Cannot hide misdirected hatred
And I can't help but override
Override considered consciousness
If you stay here I might kill ya'
I might kill ya
Physically or otherwise blatant aggression
I know it's cliche
But just go Take with you what you can
If you don't wanna see yourself thrashed
Take with you what you can
And the fuck right outta' here
I am constantly criticized
Criticized behind my back I know
Don't you act like you're so surprised
So surprised if I got a bone to pick
Lashing out at everyone
Everyone who's with or without me
Let me play the song I know it's cliche
But just go
Back down stay back
Take comfort in the fact there is death
I will fuck you up 2 3 4
I love blasting the sound of my raw despise
I could have the world and still have this hate
Give me the music that kills
It's the only thing keeping me
From killing you motherfuckers physically
When all else seems to fail
Give me the music that killsÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ¨
I hold another vigil for myself
When all they see sunlight I see fire and rain
All my possible prospects have turned out false
Who's to say All we lost and won
Who's to say
Who's to blame for these times
A narcissistic voyage life reviewed
To try to make sense of it what's the use
Who's to say Who's to blame
All we lost and won
Who's to say Who's to blame
Pain is all we share
I picked a fight with myself
And my face ended up in the mud
Nothing makes sense anymore
Quite honestly I wouldn't have it any other way
My quest for solace subsides
My old desires have died
Despite my lies I tried
Where did I go wrong
I've stuck around long enough
Why not wait
Matured broken sensitive but never weak
When will I really stop caring
And just set your world on fire
Oh shit Bodies rising Climates clashing
Everyone is broke
Watch them all freak out Leap out windows
Trained for years to compete for garbage
I can't wait for the day you see
You've been wasting your time with this pursuit
Only greed you will get what you deserve
Fine You wanted to compete
Well this is me competing
I'm well aware
It's me against the world
You wanted to compete
Well this is me competing
I'm well aware
It's me against the
Fuck this place
I am one of many but I don't have a team
So I scream and make songs by myself
I cannot compete civilly so I freak out
Time to time maybe bomb a fucking place
There's no difference between them
Fuck them kill them watch them die take my life
I don't care I'm a victim you're a victim too
It's me against the world
Bring it bitch
Same shit day to day
Man I hate this fucking place
Lies fakes and deceit
It's a savage rivalry
Life It's a savage rivalry
Neurotic psychosis forging alternatives
My life and failures become your problem
When I embrace calamity
Follow examples of rivals before me
With them I identify
Another of many
Yet nobody's with me
And I'm alone here
Deviating
Within the siren of fear
Burned from lights you never saw
Lost your voice and lost your mind
Bleed
I've made a deal with no one
Bleed
I'm too wise for my own good
Bleed
It's all they want me to do is
Bleed
And now you're going to suffer
Suffer me
No control but still in pain 
Fear exists but not like yours
Scarred for life and never right
Hear the voice I cannot find
The future fades
The past is all that's left
Clutching a perfect knife
I push them away
Say things I might regret
To change my fucking life
The pull in my chest
That damn burn in my gut
Regret nervousness
Is this all I know
How can one person in the crowd be alone
Feeble ones pass by delicate and dead
I once knew myself
I once knew happiness
Was that just my youth Were things never true
The pull in my chest
That damn burn in my gut
Regret nervousness
Is this all I know
Our experience lives mainly through our screens
So that we can breathe and not really live
How can one person be the crowd all alone
Building our demise
Fucking up our lives
Machines have the say Machines have the say
No fuck them all

Poverty on pangea can polarize plenty more
That's not all next step is

With guards protecting bad ideas
This hegemony is hard at work
Get back in line you'll fit in fine

Questionless people do you
Think you can do any less
The highways The Slipstreams of halfsacks
Are jammed up from pillar to post
Night changes things
Everything is foul and filthy the reign
The settlers are kicking off their shoes
Flex those comets bury that asshole
'Cos noxious obnoxious is guilty as hell
Take those smokestacks to your lawyers
And smoke out the lot of them
Drown them all out

He's a wretch and
Like all the rest he thinks
There's time to make trouble
And time to make a mess
He says
Punch in automate
Stomp on stamp out
Mechanized and traumatized
He's tapping things obsessively
Find his boss's office
and tears it apart
Torches the evidence
Quits his job
Voltage highways
Currents moving constantly
Blissed out and circuit bent
He's summoned by his majesty
Anxious electric
Taps into the registry

Lives like a hammer

A new kind of prophet
A new aristocracy
Prelude to the coming of
A new machine metropolis
Slum service served on the sly
The signs say
He's sketchy Singing all of his sighs
It seems my pig comrade
Has tripped
Around town
A chattering tone was stacking stones
Building a conversation
The alley said Fine I'll take the time
Stone after stone
 He bellowed
Cover was blown
 His mind dropped and
then he stutter stepped
The alley got restless and walked
Needs a new place
And while the titans move he'll slither
Underneath the Slipups
Fresh prize at his side
He was itching to
Hide from the
Same old
Flies
And even time reversal symmetry
Is baffled by the smirkless face of history
Analytical avenger can't be held back any longer
By these self adhesive shackles
Arranged in sequential order
Up the spine of the self appointed
Full time rearrangers of yestereon
Overwhelmed by the repeating pattern
Yellow rain pisses in the well again
While closing inon rationed out repossession
The fact remains this is the wrong time line
I'm looking an old photo of faroff
In this night made of glaring lights and thunder
we'll have fun together playing craps
hoping that time can erase the image
I'll wear my medals on my breast your downfall
Following orders is my innocence
this is my moment this is my hour
a single shot then eternal rest listen to me
This is my life this is my faith
today paradise is dressed in mourning
Mother protect us with your big arms
The storm that dances among us is swift
It wants our body it wants our blood
I'll be condemned for this
It wants our body it wants our blood
I'll kill myself for this
So many bodies around me
Mother make this fear become my strength
Is there a faraway place when it's all over
Are prayers enough to be let in
I'm all alone in a sea of sand
where my footsteps sink heavily
The sun still burns my lacerated back
my lips tremble with the last drop of water
my feet are bloodsoaked stung by scorpions
flesh and corpses left behind me
Look at my eyes I'm still alive
in every deprived storm of this cold life
The snake is still among us and slithers nearby
He's changed his skin to not be recognized
inhuman temptation is the gift of providence
I'm all alone in a sea of sand
where my footsteps sink heavily
I'll drag my body on until its final spasm
ploughing through the dunes of neverending ice
passing through the cold hearts of stone
Looking past the pain the true pain
Look at my eyes I'm still alive
I'll withstand all the flames that encircle me
all alone until it's all over
I'll stretch out my hands to ask
the sense of this existence
The snake is
Colours fade away morning in black and white
Hypnotic unreal eats dust of total radiation
Mystical pentagram everything needs to be done
Artist of regret it's late to start again
Splendid shadows danced on the earth's surface
distant lights surrounded the stone coast
the sea attracts all the hidden silence
and suddenly everything becomes CHAOS
General hallucination permanent reaction
reproduces spreads eats the heart of the earth
Mystical pentagram everything needs to be done
Artist of regret it's late to start again
Impatient deformations
monstrous brutal psychosomatic death structures
nasty silences in a rain of cry
Sometimes I realize that you live inside of me
Sometimes I realize that you are as I am
Create I created you you live under my control
Create I created you I live under your control
Double identity ambivalent psychotic mind
I'm falling in the darkest of apathies
Jump into the darkness I can feel your presence
Flow through my veins I'll become insane
Your pure essence I feel the fire within me
Create I created you
Can you hear my suffocated scream
It's locked up inside me I am a slave of my mind
Jump into
Welcome to my house made of honey and flowers
welcome to my hell smile at your new day
I bestow you with supreme ecstasy
sweet cloud of pure dimension
Welcome to my hell me you two symbiotic souls
Die and come to life again
Don't be easily satisfied empty out your mind
that's what I'm here forI'm on my way
In the black of your feelings
In the darkness of your lies
In the viscera of your fears
that's what I'm here for
I slither through your veins burning freezing
I empathize with your worst manias
I'll bring your perverse phobias up to the light
Welcome to my circle where there's no way out
your body's barely reacting you're adrift
Welcome to the cross of imminent descent
I ease suffering mirages and visions
Here on this bed my crown my cross my tomb
I'm living the last fragment of life
Prisoner to this useless bodyI want to scream
But no one can hear my voice my suffering my end
Here on this bed my house my life my tomb
Time flows slowly and my mind incorruptible
travels through memories travels once again
Powerful man sign now my sentence
Let me cross the river banks of this oblivion
Powerful man you can hear everything
Powerful man sign my sentence for me
Free me from evil bestow upon me eternal life
I remember when life seemed like a game
when I felt the heat of the sun on my skin
I remember when life seemed like a game
now all that's left is a virtual breath
One last breath one last frame
fetid constant smell of civilization
neon lights illuminate my days
Real light blinds my eyes
natural chaos overpowers the silences
Pathetic lives used up mechanized
pierced by ignoble indifference
Diamond sharks on the hunt
Here you'll find the slaves you're looking for
Real light blinds my eyes
natural chaos overpowers the silences
There is only an illusory way out
the journey into my mind has already begun
Where there is no pain or sadness
beyond this infinite oblivion
I fly over places beyond colours
aberration of my spirit
Transforms living men fills the land of silences
fills my voids
In this place I'm the hostile one
all I can do is lose myself in time
but I already remember where I come from
And I don't have anything to lose
don't spread my word in vain
Next stop the paradise of death
From the cosmic swarm of cryptic movements
I'm the creator of a drug and I pledge nothing 
But the nothing corrodes me 
When does the skin will be liquefied 
When can I sleep with my bones in ecstasy 
And I Am I the result of logarithms
When the flesh will conjure decisions
Embrace corrupt and follow blood infected 
Just another chapter to erase me with 
Texture of delight conform to my own mind
Just another chapter to erase me 
Texture of delightconform to my own mind
Overthrowing stability  is my reactor
and the light energize these fingers
With your strength save my weak mind
I am my worst enemy 
Texture of delightconform to my own mind 
Just another texture of delight
conform to my own mind 
Chapter to erase me 
Tomorrow dies
All that we wished to stay
Temps and then flies
What is the worlds delight
Lightning that mocks the night
Brief even as bright
Virtue how frail it is
Friendship too rare
Love how it sells poor bliss
For proud despair
But we though soon they fall
Survive the joy and all
Which ours we call
What is the worlds delight
Lightning that mocks the night
Brief even as bright
Whilst yet the calm hours creep
Dream thou and from thy sleep
Than wake to weep
The colour from the flower is gone
Which like thy sweet eves smiled on me
The odour from the flower is flow
Which breath of thee and only thee
A withered lifeless vacant form
It lies on my abandoned breast
And mocks the heart which yet is warm
With cold and silent rest
I weep  my tears revive it not
I sigh  it breathes no more on me
Its mute and uncomplaining lot
Is such as mine should be
That time is dead for ever child
Drowned frozen dead for ever
We look on the past and stare aghast
spectres wailing pale and ghast
The stream to gazed on them rolled by
Its waves return not return not
And we yes we stand in a lone land
Like the tombs to mark memory
Cease sorrows now
For you have done the deed
Lo Care hath now
Consumed my carcase quite
No hope is left
Nor help can stand instead
For doleful death
Doth cut oft pleasure quite
Yet whilst I hear
The knelling of the bell
Before I die I'll sin
Would my conceit
That first enforced my woe
Or else mine eyes
Which still the same increase
Might be extinct
To end my sorrows so
Which now are such
As nothing can release
Whose life is death
Whose sweet each change of sour
And eke whose bell reneweth every hour
Sorrow stay Lend true repentant tears
To a woeful wretched wight
Hence despair with thy tormenting fears
0 do not my poor heart affright
In darkness let me dwell
The ground shall sorrow be
The roof despair to bar
All cheerful light from me
The walls of marble black
That moistened still shall weep
My music hellish jarring sounds
To banish friendly sleep
Thus wedded to my woes
And bedded to my tomb
Oh let me living living die
Till death do come
Shall I strive with words to move
When deeds receive not due regard
Shall I speak and neither please
Nor be freely heard
Grief alas though all in vain
Her restless anguish must reveal
She alone my wound shall know
Though she will not heal
All woes have end though awhile delayed
Our patience proving
Oh that Time's strange effects
Could but make her loving
Storms calm at last and why may not
She leave off her frowning
Oh sweet Love help her hands
My affecting crowning
I arise from dreams of thee
In the first sweet sweep of night
When the winds are breathing low
And the stars are shining bright
The nightingale's complaint
It dies upon her heart
As I must die on thine
O beloved as thou art
My cheek is cold and white alas
My heart beats loud and fast
Oh press it close to thine again
Where it will break at last
From silent night true register of moans
From saddest soul consumed with sins
With deepest sins
My wailing Muse her work begins
Her work begins
And to the world brings tunes of sad despire
Sounding naught else but sorrow grief and care
I have returned
to destroy you all
you will all become my slaves
as I burn earth to the ground
you will feel my wrath
You feel your flesh
being burned off
Born in the flames of sodom
I feel no pain
you will all bow before me
or be put to death
I will scortch all your land
and rape your women
you will pray
but your god will not show
I will be your leader now
my army will grow
as your world is swallowed in fire
your life will soon come to an end
I will being death
I will bring tears
there will be no mercy
your preachers taught you to dispise me
even they will be put on their knees
begging for their lives
as I will be cutting off their heads
setting their bodies ablaze
I have come for genocide
you will all die
as your world crumbles
there will be nothing left
Setting your world on fire
burning your churches down
you will soon see
Setting your world on fire
burning your churches down
you will soon see
you were all wrong
Bring forth the nazarene
here charged with heresy
his chosen people chanting death
this false messiah
self proclaimed king
he shall suffer
his god no where in sight
he shall suffer
forsaken bastard son
the mob cries out for blood
his chosen people chanting death
abandoned weakling
cries out in pain
he shall suffer
his god no where in sight
he shall suffer
torturing
thrashing whip
breaking bones
ripping skin
whimpering
to his god
march him to the hill
at last the time to kill
hammering
into the flesh
pounding nails
with violence
hands and feet
into the wood
soak the ground with his blood
staring at his whore
watch as the blood pours
now he dies
hear his mother's cries
now he dies
slaughter complete
all will suffer
their god no where in sight
there will be no resurrection
followers will spread lies
lies
Screams fall silent as you are taken from earth
the darkness consumes my soul
as the blood splatters all through the room
your eyes will soon close
death approachs as your life is drained from you
insides falling out onto the floor
watching your life end as i become erect
cutting out the heart so my member can expload
the stonger the stench the more cum I release
the bodies build up but my mind will not ease
every cut makes my blood start to flow
my phallus slowly begins to grow
my next victim will be the same as the others
stalked in the night and cut deep in the throat
my urge to kill grows day by day
my dick grows in anticipation
as I see my next contestant I feel it get hard
cutting out the heart so my member can explode
The Anticipation of Death
their eminent demise is not because they disobey
bringing home my prize of human meat
deboned defleshed prepping my harvest
Herds of human cattle
marching 5 by 5
none who enter will ever leave alive
one slice begins the drain
my power strengthens from their pain
all forever more my existence shall remain
Every single drop of fluid drained into my cup
no amount will satisfy I always long for more
bring my bodies filled with life
I only live to gorge
torsos bisected
nothing put to waste
entrails extracted
bones smashed into paste
I need the flesh
I need the blood
the bodies fill my moat
as the corpses pile up
they start their vile bloat
my never ending lust for death
the price for this my oath
eternal life for eating man
my contract with this goat
Herds of human cattle
marching 5 by 5
none who enter will ever leave alive
one slice begins the drain
my power strengthens from their pain
all forever more my existence shall remain
Nations have fallen to my hunger
my twisted mind ripping lives asunder
The fires of hell burning within my eyes
as I claim another sacrifice
population decreases
as each repost I crave deceases
scant remains lay on the ground
Long have I consumed this world
it's children I've devoured
the sanctity of human life
for centuries deflowered
now the well for lasting youth
For me will soon run dry
I'll feel the woe i sought to best
the deathless now must die
one thousand years have come and gone
no more remain to kill
but like the beast that owns my soul
I have not had my fill
My palate shaped by decadance
there's just one thing I'll eat
though I'm the final specimen
it must be human meat
Every single drop of fluid drained into my cup
no amount will satisfy I always long for more
bring my bodies filled with life
I only live to gorge
Torsos bisected
nothing put to waste
entrails extracted
bones smashed into paste
Walking through the darkness
you will not hear me
I have come to disembowel you
Your insides are all I crave
I will cut you open
and take what is now mine
Your blood will pool on the ground
next to your lifeless body
Your screams roar into the night
soon you will be dead
You are the organ donor
and I will take them with force
Multiple Stab wounds to your chest
Before I rip your ribs apart
I put my treasures into my burlap sack
slowly taking your limbs
cutting off more and more
Your screams roar into the night
soon you will be dead
Your cunt will bleed
Looking for my next victim
wanting their blood spilled
I will desmember them with a slice from my knife
taking more body parts
I will kill more
Death again for another young whore
Amended every piece
Of your tortured body
A mask out of metal
Banished to your
Disgusting face
Your inner organs smitten
From sickness
I will replace
With massive device
From this moment
You'll never feel
Pain or fear again
But you wanted
To fend me off
You just didn't realize
That I never
Wanted to harm you
I never wanted things
To go wrong that way
All the experiments
On your body were never meant
To manipulate your sanity
You are broken
You're falling apart
You're no longer the person
I wanted to create
You are lost
You are insane
You are the spawn of hell of hell
The life that I gave to you
You must appraise
Don't use my gift to hunt down
People like dead meat
The sound of a shot will end up
There is something vivious on my mind
And I have to surrender
I am so vulnerable
It's like a monster
Disemboweling me
I am feeling helpless
I want to tear
It out of my body
But it became
A part of my rotten life
I can not stop it
There's no happiness left
Life is a lie
It keeps coming back and tries
To finish up what's left of me
Now I found an escape in quenching
My thirst for blood
And repayment
Now I started the quest
For the reason
Of my
Sickness
Until I may
Rest in peace
I will find
And torture and kill
The beautiful people
For they are responsible
For what has happened to me
I am cursed by sick
And dead emotions
Coming from inside
The style you walk this world
With no respect
For anyone
This is my aversion
You are just like dregs
You do not desire
To stay alive
You're a terrible residual
I can't understand
Why people
Like your believe
They're like Rambo
You look like the people
Who live in trees
With teeth eroded by maggots
But still
You believe
To be the king
Of this village
Go home to mommy
Tell her I love you
At home you are the pussy
Sitting in the wardrobe
Crying why mommy
Doesn't love you
In the evenings
But turn back
To the wannabe Rambo
Of your small world
Show all the people
Of this fucking
Asocial planet
That you are the future
Of tomorrow
However I will not be like
All the idiots
Who change sides
When they see you in the streets
And wet their
Expensive jeans
When you start crying in your circus
Don't want to follow the grind
Pass back what they
Gave to me I don't want
To be their slave I have to break their neck
Rip of their fucking head
Split their hearts in two
Let these maggots bleed
They don't make me their slave again
Reigned by hate
No fate was left
Waiting for the moment
That makes this agony end
Waiting for the moment 
Let the revolt against the fucking breed begin
They won't take me down
Take me down once more
Try to break away from chains
That shackles your hands
And give them back the same torture
You had to survive
Grab the cutthroat that lies
On the table opposite to you
It's only one step
To let them feel the torment
This daily grind
Has to end
Now it is done
You always believed I was like
All the other stupid puppets
But now I am pulling the cards
I switched sides now your are
Locked from the inside
I will let you swallow your own shit
And make you feel
What you have spread over me
The first step of agony is raw
Pure pain
Me ripping off
Your fingernails
Flaying the skin
From your dismembered body
I know
You do not
Believe me
That is the reason you must die
Die very slow
Die in your own misery
Die alone with no fucking perspective
In your head
Full of shit
All this time of suffering
Changed my way of thinking
I feel delighted by killing
People who deserve to leave
The world of the living
Just like you
I constructed my homicides
Like killing games
So that my immolations
Will have the chance to change
Their lives
Just like me
I have never
Seen the catastrophe
That happened
In front of my eyes
Tried to dispel the pain
I trusted you
I was so blind
Scratched out my eyes
For you
I know what you are doing
The guy you fuck with
Can't hold back my rancor now
I loved you so long
Why must it turn into hate
Excuses are senseless
I will never close my eyes
I will never be blind again
One day you will lay here and bleed
An agony I had to live
The torture reflect on you
I was so blind could not see the truth
Tried to dispel
Everything you were doing
Is there no repentance you feel
His childhood was anguish field
With hate lies
Betrayal and never ending pain
Abandoned
By his family
For he is not like them
A genetical error made
Him a monster
For everybody
To see he lived his sick life
Isolated
From society
An adult now he's searching
For the spirit of live
In women never
Really being noticed
Isolated
His love turns to hate
It's only when he can
Control and rule
Them that he's satisfied
Torture was no everyhing
But the fun in this sick game
His nature is characterized
By pain and hate
Is saw the fear in her eyes
She lost control over here body
And mind
Why did it have to get this far
We've spent all time together
But your ignorance
Torn us apart
I saw the fear in here eyes I relied on I vain
Your affection
Support and the fact of love
Mean the way
I am
I still love you
Even through
You're dead
Now it's now
I realize how much you mean to me
Even through
You're dead
Now it's now
You mean to me thrilled by a sense
Of guilt embossed by grief
Now is see this life
This life
Has become senseless
preposterous meVictory or die
What do you say what can I ever do for you
What are we gonna to do to pass the time
Equality is just a state of mind
Believe whatever is right
What's right for you tonight
You know where to draw the line
Where shall we go to let it out
Life so often blows your candle out
Who knows what the fuck it's all about
I saw one myself it ain't no lie
Look down and see the road you're on
As if you run a marathon
That's the spirit victory or die
What shall we do to even up the score
Darkness is a thing we've seen before
Believing is your right all right
Whatever makes you right
You always end up on the killing floor
Take a careful look as the swing by
Thats the spirit victory or die
They're always hungry look them in the eye
They are looking at your daughters
They've seen the flying saucers
You have to tell them victory or die
Or die
What do you want from your miserable life
What do you see in a future so bright
Get what you want do what you can
You'll get more pussy if you're in a band
I always wanted the scream in the night
I always wanted the noise and the light
Raving and fighting
Maybe you'll shake maybe you'll break
You'll never escape
Thunder and lightning
Life on the road is not easy my friend
You can't remember you can't pretend
All of your dreams can really come true
All of your nightmares are waiting there too
I always wanted the dangerous life
I always wanted the outlaw delight
Stand on the stage promises made
Under the blade scratching and biting
Maybe you'll die
Maybe you'll fly
Fire in the sky
Thunder and lighting thunder and lightning
What do you think's going to be your reward
Sixty year watch or a kick in the balls
Time is a wasting you don't get it back
Move out and prove out and always attack
I never wanted to be nowhere else
I spent my whole life pleasing my self
Out on the stage' out of a cage
Shock and outrage
Slipping and sliding
Maybe you'll shiver maybe you'll quiver
Quick on the trigger
Thunder and lightning
Thunder and lightning
Thunder and lightning
Thunder and lightning
I didn't see the fire I didn't see the smoke
Stop and look and wonder
Breakfast in your cell
You better keep your head down
In the fire storm hotel
I want to understand it I want to believe
Slide in nice and quiet
Stop and listen well
Hope your luck don't give you up
At the fire storm hotel
Woo burn
So wait and I will tell you what happened here
Look into the windows
The shadow rings the bell
Chaos rules in the empty pool
At the fire storm hotel
Take a look at all them people
They don't look too well
They burned and screamed in a fever dream
At the fire storm hotel
Show me a sign get back in line
Show me all the tricks that you have learned
Show me some spite and if you do it right
I will show you how to kill and burn
Down in the maze every single day
Fighting and biting and this is our trade
Down in the flood we mean you no good
Fight fight we fight alright
We are the ones to kiss you good night
Die die time goes by
We will shoot out all of your lights
Show me a clue maybe give me two
Give me everything that I deserve
Show me some hate before it's too late
And I will show you how to keep your nerve
Down in our holes we burn like coals
Eating the fear of death in your souls
Down in our caves no one is saved
Fight fight we fight all right
We are the ones to kiss you good night
Die die time goes by
We will shoot out all of your lights
Tell me the news something I can use
Something red hot to light my fuse
Show me some teeth sometime next week
I will show you all kinds of abuse
Down here in hell under our spell
Burning and screaming and laughing as well
Here in the dark we swim with the sharks
Fight fight we fight alright
We are the ones to kill you good night
Die die time goes by
We will shoot out all of your lights
Smite smite shine your lights
We are the ones to give you a fright
Die die time goes by
We shoot out all of your lights
What is it you're looking for
I don't think you will ever find the gold
What got your curiosity
The Devil he looks at you
The Devil steals your breath
You'll never know the law
Go look into the face of death
Are we still talking now
I know you'll never tell another soul
Is it a catastrophe
The Devil knows you now
The Devil will break your neck
Nobody will hear your call
Go stare into the face of death
Come on
If you speak I'm out of here
I don't know you how can that be so
If you want I can be sincere
The Devil seeks your soul
The Devil see what you get
Abandon all hope now
Go look into the face of death
Right now
Don't speak of your beliefs
They are yours to keep
Memories will fade
As time goes by
Remember just yourself
Me or someone else
You will be the only one to try
Freedom to believe don't cost a thing
Innocence should not be bought and sold
Kiss a bolt of lightning
It'll make you sing
Electricity deep in your soul
Don't tell me who I am
I don't give a damn
Your dreams are nothing
You're a nowhere man
Think you're really smart
Think you're pure in heart
Go ahead and tell yourself you're not
Disbelief don't ever cost a dime
Innocence should not be bought and sold
You need an open mind
Shiver up your spine
Electricity deep in your soul
Don't speak of time gone by
Don't even try
My memories are skulls and vultures in the sky
I remember everyone
Tall or deaf and dumb
Now I am the only one passed by
Freedom to believe don't have a price
Innocence never gets too old
You need a bolt of rock
Severe toxic shock
Electricity deep in your soul
Look at me what do you want
I'm a man as well as you know
Evil in the air tonight we better make it right
Dollar for my mercy tell you what I know
Look see look see see you down upon your knees
I see sorrow coming down quick and sly
Bad Magic evil eye
You better watch your step
Time be getting hard if you don't go
One silver dollar help you if I can
I see sorrow in your way by and by
On your way lonesome road poor boy heavy load
Bad magic evil eye
Swamp mud can't get free
Don't look back you don't want to see
Listen up listen up listen good keep it shut
I see you in the fire flame  die
Bad Magic evil eye
Step into the street all your nerves are shaking
Look over your shoulder
Better use your feet or you ain't gonna make it
It's getting colder
Better get it over now better show your hand
Tell the world a good word catch me if you can
Better face it all now show 'em what you need
Everybody screaming
Better think in code might just be a shakedown
You might be dreaming
Better get it on now better show your face
Speak the name of Judas caught up in the race
Better to be faithful to your destiny
Hey
Going out your mind all your life is changing
Better watch your back now
Why are you afraid nobody explaining
Running with the pack now
Better you get out of town nothing left to lose
Nobody around now one to accuse
It's the final act now time for us to leave
Eat the sun eat the gun teach them how to bleed
People so predictable drive you fucking nuts
Fall upon your sword now nothing up your sleeve
Let them see let 'em be teach them how to bleed
I know myself like no one else nothing to defend
I can't tell you just what made me change
All I know is who I am I'll never let you down
The last one you can trust until the end
I don't want to hear your fairy tales
All I know is who I am I'll never let you down
Go
You can never live that life again
That will still be with you until the end
Don't you listen to me it don't make no sense
The way things are I just can't see
Seems like things got too intense
Stand up straight and talk to me
Stand up right keep your fingers still
Pretty sure I think I know you now
I just got to know so whisper sweet and low
Speak the name tell me who to kill
Just tell me the truth can't you work it out
The way you live is a mystery
Hard to figure guess there ain't no doubt
Tell the truth what do you see
Be afraid I'm sure you know the drill
Pretty sure I think you know me now
Don't say it's unfair I'll hit you with a chair
Speak the name tell me who to kill
So it comes to this maybe it's the truth
Dangerous is how it seems
Burning fit to raise the roof
Turn around tell me your dreams
Come on in tell me who you are
I swear to god I know you well
I just have to find some blessed peace of mind
Step up close tell me who to kill
Talk to me talk to me
Tell me who to kill wanna know
I want to know
Tell me who to kill
We are the homeless lost in space
Wandering searching out of place
Now we find you our journeys end
You must vanish your world must make amends
We are coming to kill you declaration of war
You have seen us in the sky now you must die
We bring you sorrow no time to say goodbye
So die now choking on your screams
Oh
You will not see us but we are here
Breathing deep your atmosphere
Your world is ours and now we call
We are the others inside your walls
We all come to waste you to watch you die
Some of us among you our trusted spies
We are your masters we feel no remorse
You have no chance against us we live for war
You will be gone forever no fever dreams
Die then choking on your screams
Your time has come now accept the fact
We are the stronger race you will die like rats
Bow to the eternal law cruel and extreme
What are you going to do now
Out in the lonely times
How will you ever get through now
Remembering all of your crimes
Who would you blame who could you sue
If the sky came looking for you
How are you gonna live now
Out in the lonely fields
What do you have to give now
I wonder how do you feel
Running jumping praying it wasn't true
How would you look without a clue
When the sky comes looking for you
Looks like the same old story
Looks like the same old game
Don't think you're bound for glory
I think you might be insane
Dogging weaving trying to find a way through
Gonna be bad whatever you do
When the sky comes looking for you
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I rode a tank Held a general's rank
When the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
Ah what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game come on come on come on
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
Ah yeah what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name oh yeah
But what's confusing you
Is just the nature of my game
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guessed my name ah yeah
But what's puzzling you
Do I ascend up above or do I rot in this whole
I amma sinner just like the rest
Do I ascend up above
Does the fire feast on my flesh
When I die where do I go
Do I ascend up above or do I rot in this whole
Death is the path to eternity from time 
Look in my eyes and watch me watch me die
Watch me die
The shadows of my past are cast too dark 
too dark for me to shine
Buried alive by the sands of time
the hourglass flips as I begin to die
Death is a transformation to eternity from time
Lost at sea I float into the darkness of my mind
So what's the point of being alive
Living a lie
I am ashamed of what I've done
I hate what I have become
one last breath before the plunge
I let the ocean fill my lungs
We live and die by the hands of time
The taste in my mouth reminds e of a place 
a place that I once knew
I lay adrift in this occean of time
waiting for the tide to bring me back to you
I thought I heard you say my name
I'm digging my own grave
Watch me die
Watch me die
One nation under God
where is God in this nation
No one is safe our worst fears are yet to come
I will embrace the end
This nation is decaying from the inside out
I realize we live lives of lies
Stab out my eyes and rid me of my sight
This culture teaches us how to die
So we must stand and fight for what is right
We are the threat
Try and cut me down but you won't
Well know this I'm sick of the lies
Never will I bow to you
Never will I die
One nation under God
where is God in this nation
This nation is decaying from the inside out
I realize we live lives of lies
Stab out my eyes and rid me of my sight
This culture teaches us how to die
But we must stand and fight for what is right
I will embrace the end
We are the threat
We are the threat
Time is death Eternal Rest
How can you forgive me if I can't forgive myself
I took you for granted and now you're gone
How could you take him from me
Father dig my grave
Memories run through my mind
only memories frozen in time
I have so much pain things aren't just the same
He lived a life of happiness
a life filled with love
I need you just to keep breathing
Who knows what tomorrow will bring
Because tomorrow's a broken promise
Live my life in regret
It was so hard to see you go
but in the end there is hope
I will never let go
Live my life in regret
It was so hard to see you go
but in the end there is hope
I will never forget you
You took his life like a thief in the night
For all I know you could take mine 
with the blink of an eye when you could die
I watched the light leave your eyes
I will see you again until then
I will cherish these memories
You will always have a place in my heart
Live my life in regret
It was so hard to see you go
but in the end there is hope
I will never let go
Live my life in regret
It was so hard to see you go
but in the end there is hope
I will never forget you
I put you in the ground but I see you in the sky
If you could see me now you would be so proud
What happened to that heart of fire
that burned so bright so everyone can see
On my feet
Every sin is another nail in the cross
Why do I do this to You
Why do I do this to myself
I can't save myself
But from Christ alone
Every sin is another nail in the cross
Why do I do this to You
Why do I do this to myself
Simply to the cross I cling
You paid my debt and now I'm free
You washed my hands clean and now I'm free
He put His son in my place not in vain
It's the heart of grace
He forged all of my plans from the very start
from His love I will never depart
I will approach the throne in faith
Simply to the cross I cling
He put His son in my place not in vain
It's the heart of grace
You put Your son in my place
You paid my debt and now all I know is grace
You have given me everything
I long to hear You say You are forgiven
Hallelujah Hallelujah
Salvation has been won
I am a beggar adopted as a son
I long to hear You say You are forgiven
I stand on solid ground
I know there's more life than just me
I stand on solid grund
You save me from my own demise
that empty shell of a man that I once was
I am forgiven for what I've done
All of my sins are washed away by Your holy son
I am not a slave to death
I will not become like the rest
I am not a slave to death
I will not become like the rest
I will not sit idly and watch you burn
I will not become another burden on this earth
I stand on solid ground
I know there's more life than just me
I stand on solid grund
Finally I'm set free
I am forgiven I am a new man
I will eagerly wait for the end
I'll leave this past life behind me
Media parte mundi
Funditus aberramus
Ultimum excidium sui
When darkness will reign and blind us all
When darkness will reign and blind us all
Allegiance will bind us if we do not fall
We cannot tell when morning comes
Is there a choice to live another day
Don't throw your life away by cheating time
Sugared placebos only fool your mind
Now I want the water to wash away all my sins
The fire to burn away my thickened skin
When darkness will reign and blind us all
Allegiance will bind us if we do not fall
Novas portas pandimus
What is this pace the type of dance
I cannot tell which steps I have to take
I'd like to leave just run away
My feet are tangled up
So hard to face the pace of the clock
What do you think will it ever stop
So will I fall and not get up
I take it all in stride
Now I want the water to wash away all my sins
The fire to burn away my thickened skin
Everything has a reason for its happening
Can't you tell it's your own spell and
Everyone has to dance this dance like anyone
Can't break free of destiny
We should open new doors and
Close the ones that we've left behind
Now I want the water to wash away all my sins
The fire to burn away my thickened skin
When darkness will reign and blind us all
Allegiance will bind us if we do not fall
Novas portas pandimus
Et post nos occludimus
Magna culpa nostra
Poena danda nobis
Usque ad finem erit dierum
Ad finem temporum
You can't force yourself upon me
And you never will
You can't keep digging in
Desecrated graves
No more innocence left to spill
Don't be afraid participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the
Very last crusade
Ad finem temporum
You can't get away with your crimes
And you never will
For you'll have to pay the price
And the time is near
No more innocence left to kill
Don't be afraid participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the
Very last crusade
Magna culpa nostra
Poena danda nobis
Usque ad finem erit dierum

Don't be afraid participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the
Very last crusade
Don't be afraid participate and
Just give us all your trust
Your soul will be saved
Just honour me I'll set you free so
Get ready to join the
Very last crusade
Get ready to taste the
Final victory
Ad finem temporum
Living at different places
Evading into various spaces
My compass has broken I'm losing the way
An ongoing madness has led me astray
My past breathes down my neck
And it seems now that all I can do is
Go back to beginnings when all lay ahead
A fading illusion now plagues me instead
In me there's still a place that fulfils me
If I try can I find solid ground
I follow elusive paths
Oh it seems they've been written in stone
And the door to a new life is closing so fast
Burning the bridges will not bring me back
In me there's still a place that fulfils me
A sanctity here that I call home and run to
When winter descends
If I try can I find solid ground
A sanctity here that I call home and run to
When winter descends
If I try can I find solid ground
Or am I just wasting time
Trying to keep myself afloat upon this stream
But a thought is pulling me down
Pulling me all the way down
We are wandering towards a blank infinity
And extinguishing will now be the only way
To diminish your sins
This vortex can't be filled up again
A hole in space and time
Do you cry to the heaven's high
When you're confined in here
Do you not ever wonder why
These leaden tears will never dry
They'll leave behind so many shadows in my mind
High in the sky all of the clouds are passing by
Wait for the storm wait for the rain
Wait for the tears to fall down on me
We are wandering towards a blank infinity
And extinguishing will now be the only way
To diminish your sins
This vortex can't be filled up again
A hole in space and time
Do you cry to the heaven's high
When you're confined in here
Do you not ever wonder why
These leaden tears will never dry
They'll leave behind so many shadows
Do you wonder why
These tears never dry
Time forced into life in my life
Living in my mind
Labyrinth has no end
Which turn should I take
Left or right
Should I stay
Should I be the one
Do you cry to the heaven's high
When you're confined in here
Do you not ever wonder why
These leaden tears will never dry
They'll leave behind so many shadows
The substance in time forced into life
Still exists because it's here
Lost inside blank infinity
Appearance is deceptive
So perfect in disguise
There's more than what you see
A semblance is protective
A blinder for the eyes
A place to hide and flee
Flee and you'll never see
What you're going to be
If you throw away the key
The truth from the past you can't make it last
Appearance is deceptive
So perfect in disguise
There's more than what you see
A semblance is protective
A blinder for the eyes
A place to hide and flee
Flee and walk away
From what you are this day
If you are afraid to stay
The truth from the past you can't make it last
Beyond the shore the sea is filled up
With sentiment and strength
Here lie the thoughts imprisoned
A field of forces and laments
How can we hide here
We need to change our ways
How can we tell lies here
We turn our eyes away
From the truth from the past
You cannot make it last
Appearance is deceptive
So perfect in disguise
There's more than what you see
A semblance is protective
A blinder for the eyes
A place to hide and flee
If you do not cease to run away from truth
You will never see the shadow
Of your dying youth
A faÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½ade is what we all possess
But on the inside it stays a mess
Superficial changes won't recall the past
Don't deny the clock is ticking
And it's racing fast
Fading tokens of our latter days
Make us think we need to change our ways
Deep the feelings hide
They're wasted from within
And my shell will never break
The truth from the past you can't make it last
Beyond the shore the sea is filled up
With sentiment and strength
Here lie the thoughts imprisoned
A field of forces and laments
Appearance is deceptive
So perfect in disguise
A place to flee and hide and run away
Lift the shadow
The culprit you act before thinking
Caught in your ignorant sin
And lying to your own reflection
You thought you could hide
Deprived of my own innocence denied
The infinity of recurring torment
Your comeuppance
See hear the torture inside
Devouring what was left of my pride
You thought it's not going to happen to you
Thought you could hide
Deprived of my own innocence denied
The infinity of recurring torment
Your comeuppance
Dwelling in a mind mixed up and
Your regret has spread over the sea
Deprived of my own innocence denied
The infinity of recurring torment
Your comeuppance
Dwelling in a mind mixed up and
Your regret has spread over the sea
It always put me on the edge
To think of all the spoilt lives
Today I'm one step further
Not sure if I've survived myself
Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction
Whatever happens in my dreams
And I know it can't be worse than this
So I prefer to sleep
I am searching without vision
For the answers in the dirt
I am waiting just for nothing
For the day that I'll be heard
You're the sea in which I'm floating
And I lose myself in you
I am feeling these sensations
I communicate with you
I am looking without vision
For a different kind of way
I am thinking just for nothing
About that specific day
You're the night so you're the dark side
Of the day you'll never see
You're the past but everlasting
Can you share one day with me
You're the hand that I rejected
But I can't forgive myself
I am selfish and not worthy
To think of even to die for
Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction
Whatever happens in my dreams
I know it can't be worse than this
So I prefer to sleep
Tomorrow don't know where I'll be
I need some place to go now
So do you know the way I feel
Or shall I give up my belief
You're the lock I've never opened
'Cause I threw away the key
I'm enclosed within my own thoughts
That will never set me free
You're the hand that I rejected
But I can't forgive myself
I am selfish and not worthy
To think of even to die for
You're the question to the answer
And without there'll never be
Any thought in this direction
You've created this in me
You're the hand that I rejected
But I can't forgive myself
I am selfish and not worthy
To think of even to die for
And all I see are visions of my destiny
Why should I bleed and pay for others' greed
We consciously sign our own sentence of death
How can you go on did you forget
What we have learnt from the past
We can't go on killing ourselves
And with us all the rest
Why can't you see don't you regret
Reality is sometimes stranger than fiction
Whatever happens in my dreams
And I know it can't be worse than this
So I prefer to sleep
I am alone with all my thoughts
Alone without a hope and
I lost the thing I needed most
I feel I can't survive this fall
Memory fading out
Its presence still lingers in my mind
Listen to your inner voice
There's no escape there's no other choice
A foolish fate that came about
Death could not leave without
Don't try to scour your inane soul
It would be labours lost
Deep inside hides a lie
Where can we try to seek
A way so this will die
Innocence died when they took his mind
And they tried to leave him behind
Not even a cascade of tears will save you
And keep you away from harm
Concinnity of destiny
Is not what you wished it to be
Deep inside hides a lie
Where can we try to seek
A way so this will die
Blind by love
Between lust and hate
You scarred your fate
There's no time to waste
Ride for your own ruin
Odium became your opium
Please don't let me bleed for all eternity
Deep inside hides a lie
Where can we try to seek
A way so this
Please leave me be in my own misery
If you search for enrichment
And injure others
Earning more that you can spend
You'll pass the borders
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed your weakness
This fantasy is not enough for me
I want it I'll take it away from you
Your misery that softly incites me
All I do is using abusing you
Life is often miserable
In the search for happiness
The power's so desirable
They bring so much distress
Life is often pitiful
In the search for blessedness
If we weren't so insatiable
There would be much more than less
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed your weakness
If you search for enrichment
And injure others
Earning more that you can spend
You'll pass the borders
I cannot see why you'd be another me
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed your weakness
I just take care of myself and noone else
This fantasy is not enough for me
I want it I'll take it away from you
Your misery that softly incites me
All I do is using abusing you
Life is often cynical
In the search for hopefulness
We're only wanting more and more
So we got into this mess
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed your weakness
If you search for enrichment
And injure others
Earning more that you can spend
You'll pass the borders
I cannot see why you'd be another me
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed your weakness
I just take care of myself and noone else
All that you've taken from others
Will be taken from you
All that your dissonance smothers
Will then come back to you
Whatever happens tomorrow and whatever you do
Just keep in mind that the source and end is you
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed your weakness
If you search for enrichment
And injure others
Earning more that you can spend
You'll pass the borders
I cannot see why you'd be another me
When you think you've succeeded
But something's missing
Means you have been defeated
By greed your weakness
I just take care of myself and noone else
This fantasy is not enough for me
I want it I'll take it away from you
Your misery that softly incites me
All I do is using abusing you
Never finding fulfilment
The source and end is you In Lack'ech
How can we let this happen and
Just keep our eyes closed 'till the end
Most important to us is that our bills get paid
Our good intentions have always been delayed
How can we let this happen and
Just keep our eyes closed 'till the end
When we will stand in front of heaven's gate
It will be too late
Try to unlearn all that you've learnt
Try to listen to your heart
No we can't understand the universe
By just using our minds
We are so afraid of all the things unknown
A must we appease is the lust to get laid
Nothing really matters just devouring our prey
Our good intentions have always been delayed so
Our generous acts have always come too late
How can we let this happen and
Just keep our eyes closed 'till the end
When we will stand in front of heaven's gate
It will be too late
Try to unlearn all that you've learnt
Try to listen to your heart
No we can't understand the universe
By just using our minds
We are so afraid of all the things unknown
We just flee into a dream that never comes true
Low to the ground we feel safe
Low to the ground we feel brave
Oblivisci tempta quod didicisti
Open your eyes we're not in paradise
How can't you see this stress is killing me
We have captured time
So time made us all hostages without mercy
Seemingly generous fooling ourselves
Selfishly venomous time tells
Our thoughts create reality
But we neglect to be
So we're already slaves of our artificial world
We shouldn't try to control life
But listen to the laws of nature
Open your eyes we're not in paradise
How can't you see this stress is killing me
We have captured time
So time made us all hostages without mercy
Low to the ground we feel safe
Low to the ground we feel brave
We all think we're generous
But we only fool ourselves
The only thing that matters is
Our way and our vision
Selfishly we're venomous
But you know the time tells us
There is more to life than our
Higher positions race for perfection
Better faster
We must return to the laws of the nature
Free ourselves from madnessFaces remain faceless
Staring deep in my soul
A cold sense of evil
Tearing my sanity
Disturb my peacefulness
By lividity and distress
Pulsating on my anger
My emotions are mortified
Pleading my insanity
To a wall that does not object
Screaming to the emptiness and suffering
It's my state of being
Reject this tortured soul
That clings onto the flesh
And doesn't want to part
Put to rest this entity inside of me
It doesn't want to die
Murder the integrity in me
It's not what it used to be
Creating a somber character
Built on hostility
But I intend to obliterate
On my own passion for vengeance
Eternal vengeance
On the path of my wandering
I shall find comfort from sorrow
Eternal vengeance
Behold the sight of obscenity
Reflecting a wicked existence
Eternal vengeance
No passage for souls to be saved
All hope suspended by pain
Eternal vengeance
The blind following the blind
Since the period of ancient times
Spewing blasphemy in tongues
Critical and severed images
Created for the benefit of mass obliteration
Master minds are set to define global domination
Seismatic earthquake devastating
Catastrophic period of time
Apocalyptic
Shaken land raked over coals
Nations collide
Fighting for one power and rule
A heavenly voice It's Done
Descending with majesty
Dark corners illuminate
Filth seems to trangress
Into the burning bowels of the abyss
Breathing night of sacrilege burns with ice
Defiant world of mass decay
Demons attempt to mutilate
Rape and deface the human race
Intoxicate and suffocate
The weak in mind are being violated
I'm no longer of this world
A spectator to a lion's den
Waiting for the hour of death
Waiting for the hour of my death
Nails driven through my fears
Blood turns into acid rain
Casting a figure a shadow of misery
Cesspools of evil vomit from a serpents mouth
Unbelief possesses me
While I still feel alone
Enslaved by technology
Created by the hands of mankind
An intelligence developed and excessively used
Global information and access to our lives
And our sense of security
For the safety of this precious earth
Population control is in effect
Even constructing diseases to infect
Those who resist to serve
Breeding a new set of species
Is this mankind's last evolution
Fetus' incubated surgically installed
With artificial intelligence in place of brains
They'll suffocate the soul to separate the body
Formulas calculated to reduce all reasoning
Born into a realm of steel
Creating slaves from entities
Disposing bodies from their deeds
Searching for new souls
Desecrate the human body
Symbolizing hate
Soulless and among the dead
Endlessly searching for a true identity
Unable to communicate
Mouths are sewn shut to prevent any objections
The injection is painful nourishment
Liquefied dead flesh fed through veins
Incapacitated to serve under an evil reign
No soothing moments from agony
Flesh is ripped apart
From the chemicals in the air
Severed bodies torsos chopped in half
Waste the earth of it's inhabitants
Unfit habitat civilizations collapse
Earth in ruins we begin to mourn
This Armageddon has no end
Radiation falls from the sky
Seep through your pores into your body
Suffocation by gases and smoke
Choking the life out of mankind
Life desintegrates
Petrified expressions of horror
Rigor mortis in a premature state
In just a few moments proceeded by death
Disinhabit
Anger embraces me as I fall from grace
Nations collide in a race to modify
A world under one rule immediate genocide
Humans Put to a test to see if we'll coexist
Stubborn leaders persist to
Dominate each other in war
They found a brain to eviscerate
Soul by soul inhale the essence
Growing stronger with our hatred
Summoning in greater numbers
To defy our true alien world
A grim disease of dark desires
Words being impaired by grief
Absent from sight unbearable of need
A kiss of death laced with agony
Eyes wide open and pale
A chilling contortion of evil
Cherishing the beauty we see
The obscene always deceives
Minds break the silence
Solitude with a weeping gasp
The torment delivered deep inside
Blinded by the illusions
Created by the poison flowing through the veins
Manifestation of anger inside
Where pleasure took the flesh
And pain reconciled with the appetite for agony
Fever and anguish formless addictions
A passion burning fierce in upheaval
Casting dispersions on life's brittle glass
Illucid in sight and ludicrous where slow death
Alone can't cease the unbearable sight of life
Feel the eyes of insanity
Look inside your soul
Condemned to a vivid reason for suffering
A deep mental quarrel suspended in agony
No passage for souls to cleanse the unrighteous
A call to the redeemer slain on the cross for me
The splendour of fucking death
Heaving night of lustrous torment
Sin brought forth by the nocturnal moon
A passion for evil and sin
Demons taking hold of flesh
Disembodied voices without a face
Hear them calling killer of hopes
Feel the eyes of insanity
Look inside your soul
Condemned to a vivid
Reason for suffering
A deep mental quarrel
Suspended by agony
No passage for souls
To cleanse the unrighteous
A call to the redeemer
Slain on the cross for me
The splendour of fucking death
Torture devices are put
To the test to dissect
Bodies are still alive
Will be spliced and chopped in half
This meat grinding death machine
Has a soul Meat grinding death machine
Disposal of aliens
So mankind can reign supreme
Meat grinding death machine
Depriving their intelligence that's
Beyond understanding
Bodies strapped down guts hanging out
Conscience sustained while being dissected
Torture and suffering
Analyzing their anatomy
Their soul subsides
Treacherous perception
Deconstruct anatomy beyond our own
Underground confinement sick asylums
Fit for a repugnant existence
Behold the sins of mankind
A world on the eve of self destruction
A world without peace denies existence
Eyes glistening with sorrow
Emotions are mortified
A reflection of life
Despised existence unleashing vengeance
Kill Kill Kill Kill
Some pray for death some wake up dead
Dead Dead Dead Dead
Sadistic evisceration
World of filth laid to waste
Vacant planet shall remain
Treacherous perception
Deconstruct anatomy beyond our own
Underground confinement sick asylums
Fit for a repugnant existence
Behold the sins of mankind
A world on the eve of self destruction
A world without peace denies existence
Condemnation ill confidence
Break down the walls of suffering
I cannot understand
How you seem to exist
Corruptive and empowered
Pile of rotting flesh and bone
Thirty cadavers and counting
As life slips away from my grasp
One final view
Salvation is denied
Stripped of self redemption
Haunted by torture
Left unseen danger
Taunted by agony
One last cry seals my fate
Thirty cadavers and counting
Flesh eaten away
From a mysterious bacteria
Organs are petrified
From exposure to chemicals
Thirty cadavers and counting
Haunted by torture
Left unseen danger
Taunted by agony
One last cry seals my fate
Maggots feasting on the flesh
Bodies mangled and diseased
The sight of carcasses
Eternal death I'm confined
A pool of cess and blood
Eternal death I'm confined
Dangling flesh
Torn off by the scavengers
Feeding on the corpses
Decaying maggot food
Dead body odor and stench
Exploding organs ooze
Intestines stretched across this
Sacred land of neverending fucking war
In the dawn and birth of this story
Scientists proclaim a new discovery
Funded by American government
They found means of new warfare
Bodies diseased reeking of death
Injecting mutated bacteria
Seeking destruction by a warfare of germs
Create mass disposal of life
Mass viral plague
Syringe penetrates to the bone
Society defaced by this parasite
Condemned by a lifetime of pain
Creation of virus causing death
Thousands will die
Relinquish control a plan to slowly kill
Humanity falls prey to this disease
Decomposition induced by plague
Cherish the moments you have left
Introducing a new wave of death
It's toll will surely take your breath
Inherit disease passed through the blood
Suffer the pain and vomit the soul
Vomit the soul
Lives obscure a lifetime of deformity
Amputate limbless stump
Excruciating no one shall be spared from pain
Innocence is for the birds
Now we are poison and we don't care
We have no shame we strip you bare
And you so precious lost in smoke
Too busy laughing to see the joke
Nobody knows if you won or you lost
Into the palace or up on the cross
Into the gravy or into the ground
We just don't want you around
What we want ain't what we get
Rags to riches ain't working yet
For we are monsters we love our work
Raise your voice you bite the dirt
And you so patient lost in dreams
Too busy crying to hear the screams
Nobody cares if you lost or you won
In with the girlies or under the gun
Into the sunshine or under the blade
We gonna dance on your grave
Sucker
What we do is break the law
We tasted blood and we want more
For we are murder we like it fine
No quarter we draw the line
And you so gracious lost in time
Too busy killing to see the crime
Love it or hate it you're gonna pay
All of us here gonna ruin your day
Into the palace or into the pit
We think you're just full of shit
Nobody cares if you're in or you're out
We're gonna give you a smack in the mouth
Whether you go or whether you stay
I guess it just ain't your day
Sucker
Don't you look good I swear honey
Show it wherever you go
Talking looking  thinking
Keep me happy all day
Love me tender let me remember
When I get old  grey
Love at first sight love with a travelling man
IÃÂve been a slut all my life
Wish every night was a onenight stand
One look's worth a thousand words
And that's the truth alright
Moving touching and breathing
Just trying to make some time
Loving you honey don't want your money
Either your place or mine
Love at first sight love with a travelling man
IÃÂve been a slut all my life
Wish every night was a onenight stand
Come on down stick around
But honey don't bring no boys
Crawling out of the badlands
To rock in the shape of your worlds
You'll see us seldom so make us welcome
I love American girls
Love at first sight love with a travelling man
your whole world tonight
Wish every night was a onenight stand
Love at first sight love with a travelling man
give it up tonight
Wish every night was a onenight stand
Love at first sight love with a travelling man
IÃÂve been a slut all my life
Wish every night was a onenight stand
Stand up for the cause
Lay down for the law
You know what your claw is for
Far as you can spit
Don't knock on my door
You ain't welcome no more
I might be a dog
But honey you're a bitch
Ain't gonna change a thing
Ain't gonna change my ways
I don't care where you've been
I don't care where you go
Going back to the devil I know
Stand up for the count
Hold up and dismount
I know what my feet are for
I know when to quit
Don't come around my house
Or I'll put you out
It might sound harsh
But I'm done flicking your switch
Ain't gonna change a thing
Ain't gonna change my ways
I don't care where you've been
I don't care where you go
Going back to the devil I know Hey
Stand up for your life
Lay down for the knife
I know what that smile is for
Hard as I been hit
I can't be your lover
So go find another
It might sound cold
But I'm done digging your ditch
Ain't gonna change a thing
Ain't gonna change my ways
I don't care where you've been
I don't care where you go
Going back to the devil I know
Running through the darkness
Won't do you no good to flee
Stalking through the golden state
Who's bitch do you want to be
Can't run can't hide
Gonna get you wait and see
You know I'm weird I know I'm weird
I'm crazy
Now feel your backbone shiver
Lucky thing for you babe I'm so lazy
But I'm gonna pull your trigger
Look over your shoulder
And all the windows too
Bow down to the golden calf
Which bitch is the one for you
What you need is extra speed
Cause I'm gonna hit on you
You know I'm weird I know I'm weird
I'm crazy
Now feel your backbone shiver
Lucky thing for you babe I'm so lazy
But I'm gonna pull your trigger
Know you can't stop
Move it on over
But that's another story
Cause I knew your mama
Out here in the city
Just half a mile behind
Searching for the golden rose
Which bitch would you like to find
You can't run forever
And you're still on my mind
You know I'm weird I know I'm weird
I'm crazy
Now feel your backbone shiver
Lucky thing for you babe I'm so lazy
But I'm gonna pull your trigger
You know I'm weird I know I'm weird
I'm crazy
Now feel your backbone shiver
Lucky thing for you babe I'm so lazy
But I'm gonna pull your trigger
We should have got it on you know it's true
So many times I thought I spoke to you
Wishful thinking the way I feel
But you sure looked good this time
I'm sure it ain't no crime
A little fantasy involving you  me
Cone on Over lay it down
It's about time shoot me a line lay it down
All of our lives running away from the law
We all live under the sun
But we don't have to live under the gun
We still might meet again you know we could
I got so many ways to make you feel so good
I guess it's up to you to make it work
I hope it's true don't leave me in the dirt
You sure look good to me I'm sure you must agree
Just one more chance the horizontal dance
And so we're warm again perhaps a little wet
I guess it's real right now let me show you how
Some dreams come true got me next to you
Can't wait to see you naked just for me
Move against me girl take me around the world
Cone on Over lay it down
It's about time shoot me a line lay it down
All of our lives running away from the law
We all live under the sun
But we don't have to live under the gun
If the stars fall down on me
And the sun refuse to shine
Then may the shackles be undone
And all the old words cease to rhyme
If the skies turn into stone
It will matter not at all
For there is no heaven in the sky
Hell does not wait for our downfall
Let the voice of reason shine
Let the pious vanish for all times
God's face is hidden all unseen
You can't ask him what it all means
He was never on your side
God was never on your side
Let right or wrong alone decide
God was never on your side
See the ten thousand ministries
See the holy righteous dogs
They claim to heal
but all they do is steal
Abuse your faith cheat  rob
If god is wise why is he still
When these false prophets
call him friends
Why is he silent is he blind
Are we abandoned in the end
Let the sword of reason shine
Let us be free of prayer  shrine
God's face is hidden turned away
He never has a word to say
He was never on your side
God was never on your side
Let right or wrong alone decide
God was never on your side
No No No
He was never on your side
God was never on your side
Never Never Never Never
Never on your side 
God was never on your side
Never on your side
Don't you speak of lies to me
After all the deeds are done
After all the smoking guns
Don't speak to me of lies
Don't you try to scold me now
Don't you try to hold me now
Don't start acting cold right now
Don't you even try
Nothing is the same for us
All the times are changed for us
All things fault and blame for us
Good times laid aside
So now we are the lost
And now we are the last
Living in a nightmare
Broken dreams love turned mean
Living in the past
Don't you speak to me no more
After what you said before
After all the things you swore
Don't speak to me no more
Don't you know the way we are
Black enough to hide the stars
Made us take our rage too far
Don't you know at all
Nothing is what we have now
Nothing is what we're allowed
Nothing but an echo now
Nothing like before
So now we are the lost
And now we are the last
Living in a nightmare
Broken dreams and love turned mean
Living in the past
Living in the past
I ainÃÂt gonna take the blame
Don't twist the truth don't be a whore
Tell the truth  shame the devil
Don't you lie no more
I will never understand
How we came to this sad place
Just to look at your sad face
Castles made of sand
 but Here we are so we do
What we had is now untrue
What there was is lost and shamed
Here we are again
So now we are the lost
And now we are the last
Living in a nightmare
Broken dreams and love turned mean
Living in the past
So now we are the lost
And now we are the last
Living in a nightmare
Broken dreams and love turned mean
Living in the past
Living in the past
Hear her coming 'bout 5 miles away
Ah She is so fine real good friend of mine
I just wanna jump her bones all the time
See her walking she knows all the moves
Fortune cookie stand your toes up in your shoes
Oh you can't believe what she got up her sleeve
Likes me fine and that's just fine with me
That girl can't help it just the way she's made
She sure loves playing with the Ace of Spades

Christine christine
Christine I just wanna jump her bones

Where are we to go from here in time
Do you see the future do you know
What can you expect from years to come
And what can you do now to make it so
All of history is there for you
All the deeds done in the world are mad
If you don't know what has gone before
Soldier soldier see where we were
You have to know the story
Older colder life isn't fair
Got to grab the sword of glory
If you can't see what bloody fools we were
Then you were also born a bloody fool
Listen to the hundred million dead
They didn't know it but they died for you
All you know is that you're young  tough
Don't you think those millions thought the same
If you don't know where it all went wrong
Soldier soldier see where we were
You have to know the story
Older or colder life ain't fair
Got to grab the sword of glory
Read the books learn to save your life
How can you find the knowledge if you don't
All the brave men died before their time
You'll either be a hero or you won't
Don't you realize the only way
Is see why all those brave men died in vain
If all that slaughter doesn't make you sad
Soldier soldier see where we were
You have to know the story
Older or colder life ain't fair
Got to grab the sword of glory
Make out make out you must run
Divide  rule more  more

Turn me down damn shame I'll say
Going to a mode show to take my shame away
You remember You remember me yes
I remember what we are I remember only scars
I remember only stars I remember hell and mother
See only the master risen risen
After all the silence all of him laughing
After all the strangers beaten driven
Try to place all things in a certain rhythm
Do as the book told you see the pages torn
Make the spell upon them in human form
So we come to call it the great  awesome dance
Do you see before you the Kingdom of Romance
You remember You remember his face
You remember what I am I remember only weeping
Wasted with the children singing just a hymn
You can hear them only crying crying
After all the horses gallop to fathom
Try to fell under you spine of the dragon
Do as you consider writhe  spin alarm
Spell tricky magic nails for your savior
So we bravely gather though we moan with dread
Do you see before you the Kingdom of the Dead
Can I remember I remember you no
Can I remember gold I remember silver eyes
I remember silver skies I remember awesome pain
Standing at the edge of all Looking down at last
Can you see the others running running
All the horses burning sinking dying
Do you feel destiny or are you lying
Do what you were made for all must endure
Soon the door closes for good or evil
Are you the ice queen or do you want to burn
Here see before you the Kingdom of the Worm
Kingdom of Romance Kingdom of the Dead
Kingdom of the Worm All Men Must Suffer
Dr Rock is gonna shoot you full of rock  Roll

We run through the city got everything we need
We got all the aces  we got them up our sleeve
Right nowA path in a dim light
that I have to walk myself 
Rain falling from my lips
the most cleanest of all 
Dissany 
esperance in isolation
Cold hands clutching at
something that is gone 
Her
dressed in black 
A warmth
surrounding me
when I saw her eyes
sparkling
Der Schmerz
ist wie ein stummer Schrei
der Erinnerung 
Mein Geist
Benommen
der Leib willenlos 
Meine Gedanken sind meine Qual
meine Hoffnung
ist nur ein Traum 
Seit jenen Tagen
jenen Stunden
die Gezeiten so sinnlos 
Allein solange ich lebe
allein solange ich atme
akllein solang mein Herz schlÃÂÃÂ¤gt
Allein
Rastlos
treibt es mich durch dunkle Gassen
In kaltem Mauerwerk
verwaist meine Seele
Diese grauen Bauten
sind meine Zuflucht
doch sind sie auch
das Gift in meinen Adern
Ich schaue hinauf 
zum stÃÂÃÂ¤hlernen Himmelszelt
und spÃÂÃÂ¼re die Sehnsucht
entbunden von dieser Welt
War skin
comforting hope
and rays of orange light 
When I spread my arms
I leave anything behind 
Take me away
I'm drifting
sense is stunned
and gone with the wind
Enter the air
I'll never 
Take me away
far from here
When i spread my arms
I leave everything behind
All my memories
shattered
into thousand pieces 
Same illusions
everywhere I look
starting through
these walls of glass 
Every second I think
reminds me that I'm alive 
I free my lungs
swallowed by an endless dawn
I open my eyes was that real or was I dreaming 
I don't hit the ground but I'm falling forever 
To silence the voices is this the only way 
I bring you my dreams that inspire imagination 
I lie to myself and believe that I'm healing 
The higher I climb the longer I fall 
Crossing over burning bridges 
There's nothing left of you inside my mind 
The hourglass is long and empty 
The time has come to break the chains of misery 
Crossing over burning bridges 
There's nothing left of you inside my mind 
The hourglass is long and empty 
The time has come to break the chains of misery 
I remember skipping rocks across still waters 
You were never never there 
Amen 
I'm inside you I deny you 
I surround you I defy you 
Hear the voices they are godless 
No forgiveness so relentless 
In the real world you feel real pain 
A never ending war inside again and again 
Try as you will my son try 
But you will not break the chains of misery 
I remember as a child I said I loved you 
I remember the silence was so deafening 
I'm inside you I deny you 
I surround you I defy you 
Hear the voices they are godless 
No forgiveness so relentless 
In the real world you feel real pain 
A never ending war inside again and again 
Try as you will my son try 
But you will not break the chains 
I've been living to die I'm dying to live 
I'm here to break the chains of misery 
Silence the voices the critical voices 
The psyche of a child is a ravenous thing 
Why do we run there's no place to hide 
Tangled in the strand that can bury us alive 
Yes it can 
The bird in the cage sings a beautiful song 
Because it's bound by the strand 
Alive in me voices lie to me 
It's never good enough for them 
They always want more than I am 
You put your hand in the cage 
Now you're bleeding and the bird is free 
Apathetic apologies are the offerings 
As the world grows so cold suddenly 
Cause misery loves company 
Crossing over human bridges 
A child is born he's looking up to me 
We're skipping rocks across the waters 
That rise above the depths of woe is me 
Crossing over human bridges 
A child is born he's looking up to me 
Why do we run there's no place to hide 
Tangled in the strand that can bury us 
We're skipping rocks across the waters 
That rise above the depths of woe is me 
Why do we run there's no place to hide 
Tangled in the strand that can bury us alive 
Yes it can 
The bird in the cage sings a beautiful song 
Because it's bound by the strand
I've been living in the past 
Trying to live without you 
I can feel your presence here 
But I just can't touch you anymore 
Memories are all I have 
Can you hear me call 
Call your name 
Cheyenne I am 
I am so far away 
Can you feel our dreams 
They are slipping away 
I've been looking to the west 
Where the silent man can hear the harmony 
Of the children's song and its sweet refrain 
I just can't hear it anymore 
Memories are all I have 
Of the sun and stars dancing endlessly 
Can you hear me call 
Call your name 
Cheyenne I am 
I am so far away 
can you feel our dreams 
They are slipping away 
I am Cheyenne 
I am the sky the wind the rain 
In my dreams my friend 
I can see you again 
Look behind my footprints in the sand 
This moment I stop to wonder 
Why I long for yesterday 
Tomorrow pulls me under 
All the while I wallow in the mire 
The moment just passed me by 
Sunrise will you grace my eyes 
Bless my soul make me whole again 
The voice of reason guides me home 
To the summit in the sky 
Where amber waves and endless days 
Celestial spheres catch our gaze 
Desperate cries prayers unanswered 
Angry are the faithless 
Who are they who left us here 
The anthem loud the question is so very clear 
We stare into the stratosphere all alone 
All alone all alone 
I am the salt of this lonely satellite 
A grain of sand the tide has washed ashore 
All I am 
All I am nothing more 
You quote from the book of the names 
The words don't mean a thing anymore 
Forever more 
My mind has the will of the wind 
The cross you bear 
The martyrs clever disguise 
And my testament is seen with my own eyes 
You await angels of mercy 
Descend down through the sky 
I live among the living 
I'll live till I die 
I found a piece of mystical broken heart 
It's longing of the child left behind 
Till the end of all time 
That child had the will of the wind 
We've come to a place where the road divides 
And there's no turning back not this time 
Are we mortal men or are you divine 
The cross you bear 
The martyrs clever disguise 
And my testament is seen with my own eyes 
You await angels of mercy 
Descend down through the sky 
I live among the living 
I'd rather dance with the wolves 
Than stare at the sun 
Hear my confession 
I am alive 
And if it gives you solace 
Then pray for me in silence 
Just please save your pity 
And seek redemption for yourself 
And if from grace I've fallen 
Won't you forgive me and make me whole again 
I hear the voice of reason 
They speak to me in silence 
I feel I can't deny you 
I will deny your likeness of man 
I see Cheyenne is mourning 
She bleeds for all humanity 
And if it gives you solace 
Then pray for me in silence 
Just please save your pity 
And seek your redemption 
You can save it all for yourself 
And if from grace I've fallen 
Won't you forgive me and make me whole again 
I've been living in the past 
Trying to live without you 
I can feel your presence here 
But I just can't touch you anymore 
Memories are all I have 
Can you hear me call 
Call your name 
Cheyenne I am 
I am so far away 
Can you feel our dreams 
They are slipping away 
I am Cheyenne 
I am the sky the wind the rain 
In my dreams my friend 
I can see you again 
My friend 
Cheyenne 
This is the end
these faces have fallen here before
tired and blue
a light that bleeds unforgiving shadows
her olive eyes repeat failure in every glare
hold it together you'll find your peace
she hates that stare
her smiling face defense to the world 
someone called your shot
just from the other side
the self made rival you are
i thought i caught you breathing
it was just the sound of me laughing
turning heads
then their backs
its the tilt of the hour glass
and we're slowly thinking waiting and waking
please baby not another stare
i've been in that trance before
fighting not to look back
we sift through the crowds without a care
lonliness finds us beneath dim lit lights 
where pen and paper spell out confusion 
failing to escape those nights of solitude
the echos of today's misfortunes linger
its then that you realize 
you're the one that wants to cry something
because you feel nothing
we drove these streets heads to shoulders
existing to tell the tales of letting go
its all in our heads 
the faint whispers
i tried to tell myself when its already over
that the reasons found decoys
and this is holding me back
as if to say what you thought you heard
i wish i did
i escaped the horizon
feeling nothing was the easiest existence
leaving a world of regret in a wake of flames
no flame ever burned as bright
i will not leave a martyr
no more eyes to frame my falls
i can't live life for closed hearts
joy left me that day
pulled from my hands as the robbed me of life
i am leaving earth
burning the past as i turn and wave goodbye
i am finally alive
sleep never comes quick enough to protect us
like well driven nails
memories dig their claws in our backs
revealing our black hearts
unable to forgive ourselves
our parched mouths pray for rain
i left the horizon
curled up and frozen still
the tilting of the hourglass
with all this time to kill
this is just the in between
the point where worries can shatter dreams 
this is infatuations best kept secret
these faces have fallen here before
tired and blue
a light that bleeds unforgiving shadows
her olive eyes repeat failure in every glare
hold it together you'll find your peace
she hates that stare
her smiling face defense to the world 
someone called your shot
just from the other side
the self made rival you are
i thought i caught you breathing
it was just the sound of me laughing
turning heads
then their backs

the tilting of the hourglass
with all this time to kill
this is just the in between
the point where worries can shatter dreams 
this is infatuations best kept secret
Punish the roaring engine
Burnt rubber the scent of lead
Fast down the highway
Flames feed on gasoline
Bone crushing heavy pressure
Tight left adrenaline
I'm on my way
Oil as blood under the hood
Pumping freely through
I live behind the wheel
The dusty grey keeps calling me
So I drive through the night
Another city another scene
Straight ahead aimlessly
The open road is my bride
This is life on the fast lane
Sparks fly dynamite
Bullet on wheels explosive
Hit the gas tight right
And on I go
Black leather paint glows red
Horny pair of legs beside me
Speed junkie piston head
And on I go
Oil as blood under the hood
pumping freely through
I live behind the wheel
The dusty grey keeps calling me
So I drive through the night
Another city another scene
Straight ahead aimlessly
The open road is my bride
This is life on the fast lane
Let's celebrate this suffering
While the grave is still warm
We've got no time to lose
Let's set fire on everything In
honor of flame to be gone
We've got nothing to lose
Kiss before the fall
Hearts beating fast
Let's make the moment last for
tomorrow''a doom is already gleaming
It's gone so fast
Let go forgive the past for the
mercury of life keeps falling
falling down
Let's enjoy this suffering
disillusioned and free
We've still got time to choose
Let's desire everything
the name of extinction to be
We've got us to abuse
Kiss before the fall
Hearts beating fast
Let's make the moment last for
tomorrow''a doom is already gleaming
It's gone so fast
Let go forgive the past for the
mercury of life keeps falling
falling down
I fill the chamber bullet by bullet
Hoping this time it won't jam
To play a round of the northern roulette
and leave this world with a bang
Just on squeeze and all will cease
I'm ready for hell
I'm so sick of it all
With a vengeance I have hated
I hear them crows call
For the death black wings I've waited
To come and peck the flesh off of my bones
I oil the rope to be sure the knot slides
Tie down the other end tight
Stand on a chair and close my eyes
Knowing this it's alright
A step just one and all is done
I'm ready for hell
I'm so sick of it all
With a vengeance I have hated
I hear them crows call
For the death black wings I've waited
They're hovering close
Oh so close
They've come to drag me down to the unknown
Let them peck the flesh off of my bones
I'm so sick of it all
With a vengeance I have hated
I hear them crows call
For the death black wings I've waited
They're hovering close
 Oh so close
They've come to drag me down to the unknown
They're close oh so close
Won't need no coroner to tag my toe
Let them peck the flesh off of my bones
Through the sixfeet of dirt they
claim to hear the sound of the pouring rain
Saying it's me up here pissing on your grave
The stench of shit gathers more of flies to run
their mouths
Them brainless know not
what they're talking about
It's the outcome of severe inbreeding
Back then now and always
you maggots will be crawling by my side
Keeping the flame of hate alive
Until the hell freezes over I will
be the cold thorn right there in your side
I promise you rain tonight
From behind them aliases
pathetically trying to point their gun
To me it's none for all and all for none
It must be hard without them brain cells
to try and understand
With empty pigasseyes to make a stand
Hooray for the severe inbreeding
Back then now and always
you maggots will be crawling by my side
Keeping the flame of hate alive
Until the hell freezes over I will
be the cold thorn right there in your side
I promise you rain tonight
This is where it ends
I can't have the years wasted back
Reinvent something I've lost how to feel
The table is set for three
Indifference you and me and we
sit there in silence
Don't care to speak
It's not temporary
It's our cemetery
And we are carved in stone
From nowhere to nowhere
Oblivion approaches
I've said my piece want nothing from you
From bitter to worse
Oh so revengefully yours
We've done our time  Just let us go
This is where it ends
I'm getting the hell out of here
Leaving nothing behind  It was never real
The hole is dug for three
Suffering you and me and we
lay there in silence
 No need to speak
It's finally here  No anguish no fear
And we are free at last
From nowhere to nowhere
Oblivion approaches
I've said my piece want nothing from you
I love you
I hate you
I'll sing when you're dead
I loathe you
I need you
I'll scream and regret
From nowhere to nowhere
Oblivion approaches
I've said my piece want nothing from you
From bitter to worse
Oh so revengefully yours
We've done our time  Just let us go
So you thought you had it made
All on that shining silver plate
Now you're turning a brand new page
Not a word disappearing without a trace
You've spawned just rage
Have a nice rest of your life for
it's all you've got
Until it rains ice in hell
the shit will keep on rolling out your mouth
No more of you  It's zero tolerance
Can you hear the final bell it 
tolls for you that there is no doubt
We are through now  This is where it ends
Black is whiteRed is green
Spit it out Say what you mean
Trust is earned not ingratiated
The bridge is burned the past contaminated
Annihilated
Better to be hated for what you are
than loved for what you're not
Until it rains ice in hell
the shit will keep on rolling out your mouth
No more of you  It's zero tolerance
Can you hear the final bell it
tolls for you that there is no doubt
We are through now  This is where it ends
Flowers in bloom
It's a beautiful day
Headed for doom
Destruction and decay
Stare at the sun
the warm rays of light
Nowhere to run
We've already lost the fight
Hand in hand we wait this all to end
Everything dies  Withers away
There's no afterlife
No nothing's here to stay
Hope is a lie
we in vain beg and pray
to drown away
Life is so sweet
So seize the day
Destiny's sealed
And soon to pine away
Enjoy while you can
Breathe in breathe out
Try and understand the only way is out
Gun in hand we wait this all to end
Everything dies  Withers away
There's no afterlife
No nothing's here to stay
Hope is a lie
we in vain beg and pray
No one gets out of here alive 
No one comes back to testify
So enjoy while you can my child
We only got this one time
Everything dies  Withers away
There's no afterlife
No nothing's here to stay
Hope is a lie
we in vain beg and pray
Still too much I recall of them
gnawed out bones which the
mattock of time buried beneath
the pavement
And to wade in the shades won't clear the air
won't erase the stench of them dead
Will the solace be found from 
the north of the ditch
Dug deep with my own beaten shovel
Could it be at the end of the double barrel
The time is nigh
I am what I am a futile man
I am what I am a futile man
You too will pay this debt of despair
I'm not here to teach you or to show you the way
It wouldn't make any difference
The time is nigh
I am what I am a futile man
I am what I am a futile man
Still too much I recall of them
gnawed out bones which the
mattock of time buried beneath
the pavement
And to wade in the shades won't clear the air
won't erase the stench of them dead
I am what I am a futile man
I am what I am a futile man
Down this road again and it feels like beneath
the dust of time
the end of my time
Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me
Along this road once again
still it seems like it leads nowhere but away
Along this road once again
still it seems that it has been always this way
Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me
Scars are made to remind
Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me
And oh how these years have been long
while humming the notes of the dead man's song
Oh how I wish they would fade
all of them wounds I know it's too late
Scars are made to remind
Left wading neckhigh in dirt
by the flood of wastewaters
Completely soaked to the bone
Floating restless in time pining out
Through the unending struggles
Always against the stream
Beating through debris
But as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
Always against the stream
Riding on the belief
That as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
Left sailing the sea of dirt
on a raft that is leaking
Moved by the stench of the wind
Waiting the hightide to come
to finally sink in
In the scumtsunami with nothing to hold onto
Always against the stream
Beating through debris
But as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
Always against the stream
Riding on the belief
That as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
It starts to clear I'm getting near
Understanding for the past and things we've done
I can't go on much further down this road
It eats me up until there's nothing left of me
I won't give in I'm gonna win
The battle in my mind will disappear
I can't be mad for all the times we disagree
Now I think that I can see
The wall of anger grinding on my mind
Anger fills my soul
The anger makes me blind
Blind in my mind
Time s now to let go
There's no meaning to be full of bitterness
Cause that's deceit to all of me
At last my rage is gone I did not give in
Now it's past history
The wall of anger grinding on my mind
Anger fills my soul
The anger makes me blind
Blind in my mind
I'm trapped in a cage
I'm going to waste
I don't want to be here no more
I'm leaving behind
The scars in my mind
The wall of anger crushed down
Destroyed again myself and my pain
Dreams and illusions in vain
I'm moving on what we had is gone
But you will remember my name
I felt for you my feelings were true
But still enough is enough
Now look inside there's no place to hide
There's no turning back there's no coming home
I used to believe but I couldn't foresee
There'll be no chance for you and me
I am done now you are gone now
So many tears but it's over my friend
You are buried I am thru' now
But I will be haunting you until the end
At night in your dreams
What's his name is it me
Or someone else that you see
I'm having the time of my life I'm just fine
But you will never be free
I used to believe but I couldn't foresee
There'll be no chance for you and me
Ain't got no soul left you've torn it apart
You desecrated my heart
You've told me your lies I've seen your disguise
And I never close my eyes again
I am done now you are gone now
So many tears but it's over my friend
You are buried I am thru' now
But I will be haunting you until the end
I am done now you are gone now
So many tears but it's over my friend
You are buried I am thru' now
But I will be haunting you until the end
There you stood on judgement day
Why did you choose this way
Living so blinded not able to see
Past your own selfish needs
No capable of empathy
Always so blinded not able to feel
Your fiery flame is put out now can that be
Where did you make make the wrong turn in life
Time to break free of this demon inside
Crazy crazy inside
Where do you get them all
Your sick ideas and sick beliefs
Aroused by desire of stealing a life
All the crimes you did in vain
What did you thing you'd gain
Tormenting victims so sweet and so young
Your fiery flame is put out now can that be
Where did you make make the wrong turn in life
Time to break free of this demon inside
Screaming voices inside
Telling you to do whatever they want to
Crazy crazy inside
Screaming voices inside
Telling you to do whatever they want to
Crazy crazy inside
Projections of astral kind
Swirling through his mind
Soon to know when his soul will go
Destiny is soon fulfilled
His spirit will soon find peace
Encouraged by the thoughts of all good deeds
Well back from the assignment rich in the gift
The dearest of friends his closest of family
Between bed and work desk shall find his dead
One night it came a blackened vision
It chilled his spine as he realized his doom
Deep in his ball it's now appearing
His eyes aflame it's impossible to change
At the age of sixtytwo
He was finally through
Don't you dare to desecrate me
Violate me oh no
If your' fate's sealed do believe me
Vengeance shall strike
I chose my burial sight
It's here on my native home soil
In the walls of the Franciscan church
I state this public now
Please let my soul have rest
It's for your own best
Don't you dare to desecrate me
Violate me oh no
If your' fate's sealed do believe me
Vengeance shall strike
Imperial guards went through the small town
One of the guards drank wine
From the skull he had found
He never should have done
The vision came true as he died where he stood
Desecration in this case he paid with his blood
You shouldn't ignore his words
You're bound to be cursed
Don't you dare to desecrate me
Violate me oh no
If your' fate's sealed do believe me
Vengeance shall strike
He who opens the grave when it has been found
And don't close it right away
Will meet evil that no one can prove
It had been better for him if he had been
A king from Bretagne or marseille
Greed fight the one beside you
See the light that shines above you
Lie and take a bit of someone
Feel the pain you self bring on them
Can you see another day
Without whom you may betray
In a world so full of lies
I can see it in your eyes
Will you leave this place alone
Was it worth it when you're gone
In pieces you will rest
Waste your life on causing pain
In my world you're all insane
Deep you've lost your way inside you
Trust you think that we will trust you
Pain it will come and stay here
Bleed and I will laugh behind you
Can you see another day
Will you leave this place alone
Was it worth it when you're gone
In pieces you will rest
Waste your life on causing pain
In my world you're all insane
Will you leave this place alone
Was it worth it when you're gone
In pieces you will rest
Waste your life on causing pain
In my world you're all insane
Will you leave this place alone
Was it worth it when you're gone
In pieces you will rest
Waste your life on causing pain
In my world you're all insane
No trace of madness
What do you say
No trace of madness
Fight another day
Illuminates the way of your heart
Did he ever want from you to tear it all apart
Don't understand what you said
Guide me into your head take me away
Tell me of your belief
Hatred and murder
Show me what you believe in
Death is your god
A lesson learned I know what you thought
Don't understand what you said
Guide me into your head take me away
Tell me of your belief
Hatred and murder
Show me what you believe in
Death is your god
Tell me of your belief
Hatred and murder
Show me what you believe in
Death is your god
Tell me of your belief
Hatred and murder
Show me what you believe in
Death is your god
I turn the page and close my eyes
Our fairytale is over now
Forever lost inside a dream
That won't come true again it's gone
My heart is crying your name
The memories I have are slowly killing me inside
Am I the one to blame
I'll die in your arms
You know not only women bleed
Well I just don't know what to say
Beyond the horizon there's a better day
Where we could stay
Forgive me my crime
The sleep embracing me one last time
My heart is crying your name
The memories I have are slowly killing me inside
Am I the one to blame
I'll die in your arms
You know not only women bleed
My heart is crying your name
The memories I have are slowly killing me inside
Am I the one to blame
I'll die in your arms
You know not only women bleed
My heart is crying your name
The memories I have are slowly killing me inside
Am I the one to blame
I'll die in your arms
You know not only women bleed
I had a life I had a dream
I had plans I had expectations
So many things were there for me
Now the lie you made me believe in
Is like a nightmare and it's real
Always here never disappearing
Can't get it out can't make things right
It's too late I wish I could be here for you
With the death by my side
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
With the death by my side
I never thought it would make me feel this way
Now tell me what I'm in your eyes
Do you see just what I am seeing
I'm not taken by surprise
When you say I mean nothing to you
With the death by my side
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
With the death by my side
I never thought it would make me feel this way
With the death
So this is how we say goodbye
You must learn how to tell a lie
If you want someone to believe it
With the death by my side
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
With the death by my side
I never thought it would make me feel this way
With the death
We know we're not original
But god we're having fun
Considering the dreams you had
Now tell me please who won
But still you're doing all you can
To make us loose our way
Well never mind you're not important
Fuck you's all I say
The untouchables are writing in vain
They're washing the floor with our efforts again
The untouchables will never be pleased
Let's talk originality
That you don't have no more
I think I've seen that interview
Somewhere else before
So people in the musicbiz
Wake up and face the truth
Maybe you like it maybe not
But we're just all you got
The untouchables are writing in vain
They're washing the floor with our efforts again
The untouchables will never be pleased
Your lying eyes your phoney smiles
You're treating us like dirt
You're kissing ass on bigger acts
God you make me sick
The untouchables are writing in vain
They're washing the floor with our efforts again
The untouchables will never be pleased
The untouchables are writing in vain
They're washing the floor with our efforts again
The untouchables will never be pleased
Let it come over me
You've got your reasons to leave
You love you
You were a part of myself
Reflect on the life that you're living
Collapsing
You watch in horror as we all sit idly
From a safe distance
Complacent but 
All we want is to keep to ourselves
We simply follow the path under shroud
But are we really so different
You and I secretly disguised in the crowd
Searching for someone like us
But we all look the same so we keep passing by
And its all just so tragic
Because we won't be pathetic
So now when you look at me you're all alone
Some day
You'll only have yourself to blame
When you're all alone
And no one seems to care
I know
You're trying so hard just to change yourself
But don't you change a thing
Please don't be afraid
Your life is okay
Because when alls said and done
Why won't you believe
That you're the only one inside this machine
Collapsing
A central self in your individuality
Dissolving
Everything that makes us who we are
And who we will be
Who will you be
Our time is fading quickly
Now
Will you decide to be who you are
Or be someone else
Some day
Some day
You'll only have yourself to blame
When you're all alone
And no one seems to care
I know
You're trying so hard just to change but
Don't you change a thing
Please don't be afraid
To be just who you are and get back in the 
Break down
Be afraidCan you hear us Or should we turn it up
The best relationship is the one built on trust
Isn't that what you wrote
Back down Didn't sign up for this state of waste
Back down Back down
Didn't sign up for this state of waste
We want it We got it
We're going home We're going home
Going back to what this meant to us
We want it We got it
We're going home We're going home
Going back to what this meant to us
Pave the way that's the intention
We'll find a new way to get out
Coming out a little better than before
Always better than you
Back down Didn't sign up for this state of waste
Back down Back down
Didn't sign up for this state of waste
We want it We got it
We're going home We're going home
Going back to what this meant to us
We want it We got it
We're going home We're going home
Going back to what this meant to us
Are you guilty Guilty of a wasted life
This time we have we sing the last word
Hell yeah Right now this is the time and place 
This is this is this is
You are my hate beyond words
And all these questions still need answers
Can you provide
Will we figure out this isn't working
Well there she goes just like the others
This seems to happen
This seems to happen every time
I'll take this all away from you
Everything that you and I go through
Do you still want me
It's been three years since my last entry
Be good at something that's what you told me
It's been six months since I've been healthy
This seems to happen
This seems to happen every time
I'll take this all away from you
I'll say it's over
I'll walk through broken glass to let them know
Who you really are
One last time for my father
Take this knife dig it deep within my face
Consume the fluids that will make us Gods
Get it right get it right
Tonight we'll get it right
Get it right get it right
Tonight we'll get it right YEAH
Come on everyone do this tonight
We're gonna live forever
Come on everyone do this tonight
We're gonna live forever
And I only wish we could be here just to see
The looks on their faces
When they see what we've done
Get it right get it right
Tonight we'll get it right
Get it right get it right
Tonight we'll get it right
Come on everyone do this tonight
We're gonna live forever
Come on everyone do this tonight
We're gonna live forever
And now my dream is becoming reality
Come on Come on
We're doing this tonight
Come on Come on
Let's do this tonight
Right now you're all invited
The ones back then that I have made it with
You're all invited
The ones back then that I have made it with
This is what happens when the heart explains
It's love and hatred for the things you do
You can just promise this won't happen again
From here on out I'll trust myself
Words cannot express
Say the Right thing Admit you were wrong
Do the right thing go your own way now
Say the Right thing Admit you were wrong
Do the right thing go your own way now
Does it make you sick inside
Knowing that you sunk so low
Knowing that you shit on everyone
Who ever helped you
Remove that mask so we can see who you are
You're not the person you claim to be
Words cannot express
Say the Right thing Admit you were wrong
Do the right thing Go your own way now
Say the Right thing Admit you were wrong
Do the right thing Go your own way now
Does it make you sick
Knowing what you have done
Does it make you sick
Knowing what you have done
Words cannot express
Words could never explain
Don't let this pain be forgotten
'Cause this pain don't come for free
This part of us is irresistible
This part of us is tragedy
We take the bait walk right in have a seat
And watch our lives flash before our eyes
This circle of failure continues
It's up to us to show some fucking strength
This battle seems to take so long
But our link to the the other side is strong
Don't let them walk on us cause it's not over
We won't go quietly
Don't let this pain be forgotten
Cause this pain don't come for free
This part of us is irresistible
This part of us is tragedy
This part of us is tragedy
Seems like good intentions
Are what we need to practice
Things don't always have to be like this
Don't let them walk on us cause it's not over
We won't go quietly
Take the stand or take the fall
Before this world ceases to be at all
We're gonna cross this border
We're gonna get it right
Tonight we'll see the walls falling down
Lock all the doors Turn out the lights
This is your end
I wanted to grow up to be just like him
You've cast me out and I'm coming back for more
A voice inside me says Do this or do that
And if I do not obey I usually rue the day
You will see through me just want you wanted
You will end up just like me
So close your eyes
Keep your head in your hands
You're gonna pay This is your end
I wanted to grow up to fucking murder him
You've cast me out
I'm coming back for more
A voice inside me says Do this or do that
And if I do not obey I usually rue the day
You will see through me just want you wanted
You will end up just like me
You will see through me just want you wanted
You will end up just like me
You will die 
You will see through me just want you wanted
You will end up just like me
You will see through me just want you wanted
You will die
I have the strongest urge
This is going to be real bad
But for a short while I'll feel completed
This whining crying has to stop
It's worth my life if I am caught
Come on kids lets go for a ride
This won't take long just your life
You promised to keep your mouth shut
Feel the cold steel
Feel my flesh on your face on your face
This empty feeling I have got to replace
With your touch
Feel the cold steel
Feel my flesh on your face on your face
This empty feeling I have got to replace
With boys love
They could take 18 years
Guilty for loving too much
Show me love body give me love baby
Come on kids lets go for a ride
This won't take long just your lives
You promised to keep your mouth shut
Feel the cold steel
Feel my flesh on your face on your face
This empty feeling I have got to replace
With your touch
On the wall
This empty feeling I have got to replace
With boys love
Is there something wrong with me
Is there something wrong with me
I don't think you know what it is I see
When I'm looking at myself
I hope they believe me when I say
When I say when I say
Waiting at the gates it's begun to take over
Now I can feel some joy
The cobwebs falling slowly
You begin to remove these calluses from my heart
This is so new to me
I don't know where to start
I can't explain it
What you do to me YEAH BABY
I can't explain it what you do
The feeling I get when you come near
Is so incredible grips me with fear
Now I've let you in
I'm an open target for you to leave behind
But I will take my chances
I can't explain it
What you do to me YEAH BABY
I can't explain it what you do
Wishing waiting hoping praying
Someday you'll get close to me
Yeah I try so hard I try so hard
To win your heart
I can't explain it
What you do to me YEAH BABY
I can't explain it what you do
From my home it's 115 steps to your gravesite
I know this cause I go to relieve
Myself there every night
The face I once remembered
Now is starting to slowly fade
A perfect death for you
Lying amongst your own decay
You looked into my eyes
This is what you said
Cross my heart hope to die
You won't leave my side 
My crosstown drama scene
Backdrop painted with my own tears
Now your untimely death
Began to bring out my own worst fears
I was there the night the cold air
Turned your last breath into fog
All those promises you once made
Now just shattered and broken
You looked into my eyes
This is what you said
Cross my heart hope to die
You won't leave my side 
I have the brains to pick the lock
On the door you slammed in my face
I have the brains to pick the lock
On the door you slammed in my face
This one goes out to the creator
Whom I've never seen
Whom I've never heard
This one goes out to the deceiver
Who never seem to listen
Who never seem to care
Get your bibles Get your guns
Time is now they're on the run
You can't take what I've found without hypocrisy
All these words All these words
You said you'd show me
If I kept you in my heart
Still no sign or whisper
So far I'm still here
And I struggle to believe your words
That your gift to us is to destroy the world
Get your bibles Get your guns
Time is now they're on the run
You can't take what I've found without hypocrisy
Never mind what we say or want
We speak so loud so you will never forget
I've heard your stories
But I don't listen
I will never trust the words that you preach
And don't believe them
Cuz you still have a choice
They want your money not your faith
So let 'em live rich in those fairy tales
We won't allow 'em to suck us in
I back the fallen
The ones who can't speak
The ones who can't see
Don't pray for me
The rain falls down washes out your eyes
I've told you many times
This will turn out to be nothing
Now that you're out you feel the pain escape
No longer practice restraint
Even though they'll always judge you
You you walk in silence
Don't be afraid You walk in silence
Don't be afraid You walk in silence
Don't be afraid You walk in silence
They kicked you out
Your family hated you
They left you in the streets
Your secret life out for the world to see
Your courage goes unmatched
They will be proud of you someday
You you walk in silence
Don't be afraid You walk in silence
Don't be afraid You walk in silence
Don't be afraid You walk in silence
You will you shall
You will you shall
You will you shall
You will overcomeDrifting further into Darkness
The northern Lights are all fading away
Entering the cold world of stone 
My heart it feels so cold
Forever wandering the fields alone
In the cold dungeons of solitude
No light shall ever reach this emptiness
The essence of immortality
The river of tears has turned
Into eternal lakes of ice
My soul has taken by the ravens
I'm carried in the arms of the winds of funeral
Like a leaf I fall from the tree of life
Down into the abysmal universe
Winds of sorrow blow in my face 
As I walk through the forest 
Of the dreaming dead
All dreams are gone
Awakened in the sign of the moon
The galloping of the horses sounds closer
Silently on the mountains edge
We watch our enemies
Soon the battle will begin
To slay the mortal souls
With heart as stone and spirits of fire
We unleash the beast within
And attack in full glory
With swords in hands
We conquer the lands with might
With fury in our eyes we trap the human race
Crushing their lives and laws
'Til they exist no more
Soon the earth belongs to us in all eternity
With heart as stone and spirits of fire
We unleash the beast within
Born to slay humanity we attack in full glory
In the deepest of my black heart
There's a fire that will never fade
Burning full of pride
The neverending sin
Still carrying the shadow
That grows every night
All the pain I've taken
Makes my blood as steel
My body starts to shiver
When I enter the sphere of death
Awakened from the illusions
Of time and space
What once were dark thoughts
Have now come to life
Is it me or my shadow
Who's looking through these eyes
Anubis  god of the underworld
Guardian of the gates of Death
Show me the ancient secrets
By bringing Death's embrace
Within the winds of death we rise
To dominate and conquer the earth
Warriors of the black flame we are
Destroyers of light
Beyond the darkened skies
Lies the path to a greater void
Far above humanity we reign in silent might
The sacrifice of my mortal live
Has opened the astral gate to infinity
Leaving all earthly emotions behind
To enter the twilight skies
At one with the ravens we dwell
Within the transcendental hell
Beyond the darkened skies
Lies the path to a greater void
Far above humanity we reign in silent might
When I enter the ancient woods
I can feel the echoes in the wind
The sound of clattering steel
And the war cry of the pagan warriors
The painful screams of Christians who yelled
When swords penetrate their flesh
The bloody swords where sparkling
Under the light of the moon
I still feel the echo of melancholy
Nostalgia for the ancient battlefields
The sound of clattering steel
And the war cry of the pagan warriors
The wind brought forth the sphere of Death
Bitterness and sorrow
The leaves from the trees fall back to the earth
When the rain is falling down
I can feel the call of the wind
As I stare at the horizon
I see the ravens dwell in circles
The storm shall reap the sky 
Follow the autumn storm
The mighty lighting strikes the earth
When the sky is turning black 
Like a blackwinged raven I fly 
Towards the endless blackened sky
Finally I've reached the gate
The eternal frozen realm
The blood in my veins has turned
Into lakes of ice
Emotions are dead only the flame
Of the purest hate is burning
Autumn storm take my last breath away
Breathing the coldest breeze
At the top of the mountain
My soul has frozen
And my heart became as ice
Like a raven I dwell
Through timeless spheres
The light that I see
Are burning shadows
That leads me to the
Kingdom of twilight
Colder and colder
The winds became
At this freezing landscape
There's an endless sight
The chiming bells of darkness
Are calling me
When I enter the realm of chaos
Like a black hole I became
Absorbing all the light
Breathing death's breath
Reborn in death's domain
Baptized in the unholy fire
Watching the world
Through the centre of chaos
Dwelling within the timeless winds
My destiny to purify the soul
The sound of silence
Is the neverending burning
Chaos
In the shadow
Power no foe can withstand
Angels lifting up as the Lord commands
In accessible secret
Place of the Most High
Observe the wicked
Punishment justify
Dwelling in Christ
No Evil shall befall
With long life
Salvation enthrall
Spiritual concerns consent of humanity
In His spirit and purpose liberating entry
Particular gloom effected closed hesitation
Not enchanted by superstitions impressions
Not to fear in the darkness
In the shadow refuge and fortress
To provide Christ the entrance
Forsaking the empty way of life
Sure of the Spirit's fulfillment
And absence of strife
Existing in Christ's presence
Reaching the depths of compassion
Confidence in His power wisdom
And goodness within reach
More than a conqueror established to the end
Above not beneath
Reconciled by God
Ministry of reconciliation
Confidence in His power wisdom
And goodness within reach
More than a conqueror established to the end
Above not beneath
Participationg in the diving nature
Continuing to grow
In wisdon and stature
Confidence in His power wisdom and goodness
Within reach more than a conqueror
Established to the end
Above not beneath
According to His promise
New Earth Heaven descends
God with humanity now
Encampment means
Death vanquished sorrow banished
Overcome to inherit
Reside in God's splendour
Glory honour brought in
Nothing impure to enter
Death vanquished sorrow banished
Lord God Almighty
The Lamb is the temple
Divine descension Divine exclusion
Death vanquished sorrow banished
Faith has blessed faith has saved
Faith has healed faith has justified
Being sure of what is hoped for
Certain of what is unseen
Faith overcomes faith is sincere
Faith as a shield
Faith as rightousness
Being sure of what is hoped for
Certain of what is unseen
Faith in the Father faith is the Son
Faith in the Spirit
Faith should be revealed
Praise the Lord God Almighty
The praise of Christ enters our hearts
Holy nation never to part
Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
Inhabit our praise o'Lord
Encircle us with Your presence
Praise the Lord God Almighty
Who is Who was
He's taken great power
And has begun to reign
Inhabit our praise o'Lord
Encircle us with Your presence
Breathing murder upon the early church
Destruction the new faith to hurt
Fueled by zeal a twisted perception
Creating disorder a morbid obsession
Profession of faith to persecute
From heaven a voice journey refute

Conspiracy to kill voice of conversion
Speaking freely a bold proclamation

Enduring truth exposure of reason
Bring the lost out of suffering
Oneness with God social peace

Altered state of mind induced by terror
Depression placed out of consciousness
Most profound betrayal

Cease the entanglement from future abuse
Embark on a search walk in forgiveness
Aimemoi haismoi sorciÃÂÃÂ¨re Oh fleur fatale
Like a worm eating a rose like a black butterfly
She had the darkest smile but tears in her eyes
Delighted in sadnessSad in happiness
The egoistic despair she felt
The tragical irony I saw in her soul
Enslaved by her fate she knew her end
My veins are chains that rip my heart
All joy has gone away
Even the snake of suffering is crying
Reality has become chimera
Good and evil have no more sense
Black and white are no longer opposed
To become one I am alone all alone
I am lost in an ocean of bitterness
I am drowning
Eaten by the creatures of regrets
I only feel apathyOh Mighty apathy
I stand motionless in the moist of my sorrow
The scythe has cut the roots of my tortured mind
I fall irresistibly toward my destiny
Her palms become blades that brings the shadows
The angel cries become tears of blood
A memory so cold now as I weep on your graves
Night of solitude inspire me in my end
This blessed vertigo makes me feel renewed
The night is ours forever
Carry my soul fly with my words
To the land where they lay and wait
Tell them that soon I will come to them
This earth crumbles below me
The stars open the gates to eternity
Oh muses that once inspired my words
The nine of you have betrayed and deserted me
Come to me spirits that alive I couldn't see
*And show me the way to the world of regrets
Night of solitude inspire me in my end
Open the doors that lie beyond
And greet me in your arms
Life passed by and yet nothing remained
The caress of the steel the embrace of the night
Now I feel my body's falling
But my soul will reach the sky
Beware Spirits from heaven or hell sent
Neither kingdom I wish
You That dwells in the air
Beware of my wrath
No god nor devil to take me from emptiness
So dismiss when I say
Sweet coldness of iron come and rape my wrist
Oh caress of steel embrace of night
Twilight of my life
Rebirth of my soul
Oh caress of steel embrace of night
Every night let me die again
For I long the kiss ofdeath
Looking down on the earth
My body lays they cry around
I am dead and yet my eyes do cry
I am dead and yet my mouth do smile
You haunting ghosts of the past come to me
Great winds set my soul free to wander
You haunting ghosts of the past come to me
And let me join your garden of nevermore
Horned angels take my soul far beyond
Where the sun never rises never sets
I was the spirit lover now I become real
All ideals are lies 
Nonsenses to overcome
You can't be free in this miserable world
Forget what you know and listen to your soul
Tragical concepts are running into my mind
I just wanted tranquillity and emptiness
Transubstantation from abstract to concrete
Life's not a dream anymore
Here comes the ages of chaos the ages of blood
Time has come to sufferNow we liveWe are lost
Come to me Pale light of hope
Your embrace can close these eyes
Be the poison that runs into my veins
And spread your wings for me
Through being through cold existence
Your heat can burn the power
A mournful requiem come with my first breath
As I drown in existence
Love lies bleeding
Stabbed by a blade called  life 
Stabbed by a blade called  lie 
My will become useless
This is the end
Funeral lamentations come to my ears
Let me satiate the earth with my blood
The tape running fast through the gears
Lost and forgotten it's his greatest fear
The lone obsolete engineer is here
Infernal trappings of long distant age
The Luddites march on in a rage
On through the darkness their purpose is clear
The novice is guiding the seer it's clear
Algorithmic memories fill the air
Memory cells are coded sit and stare
Interfacing clouds fill the brain
Grotesque applications kill the pain
Programmed children stare at vacant skies
Pixilated landscapes fill their eyes
Cryptic messages sent out from magazines
Range guides soon arrive there death machines
Now your fate is resting in his hands
Victim of his vulgar lesson plans
Manumitted of this innocence
To a miracle of circumstance
Lust turns to avarice
Overwhelmed by cowardice
Sophomoric indiscreet
In a violent trance
Overwhelming as it seems today
Inappropriate but who's to say
Silent binding of authority
Good intention wrapped in irony
Blustering arrogance
Lost in pomp and circumstance
Guilty in just one glance
Never to be free
Mustering the strength to hold him back
Waiting for misfortune's whip to crack
Worth a lifetime of repressed desire
What you can't have only fans the fire
Lust turns to avarice
Overwhelmed by cowardice
Sophomoric indolence
In a violent trance
The seeds of revolution sewn
12 inches of overstock
Cleaned heads on the chopping block
This is where mind pollution's grown
And as your viruses are burning through shields
Corrupted firewall is turning the reels
The seeds of revolution sewn
They'll weld your eyes to a phone
And churning out one more drone
To free up space for one more mind
They'll try to conceal your fate
Too far but they just can't wait
To find the upgrade for your kind
Leaving a pornographic memory concealed
Big Brother's federation grows
I did my first job in Chicago
And took a razor to his eyes
And when he tried to struggle
It's difficult to juggle lies
It was a wedding in St Louis
Where she was strangled with a tie
They tried their best to help her
But all just stood there hypnotized
The phony accusations fly
The photographs were no surprise
I'm not an agent for your pity
You're not the slave of my desires
A faithless revelation why
As I'm swimming through the atmosphere
a discontent's always brimming
Passed the age where I can fantasize
and disbelieve that I'm living
Always scared of death so take a healthy breath
Fantastic altitudes and platitudes
of attitudes that I'm giving
Sharpened senses tell me this may be
the end of peacefully living
Like a monogram tattooed on my skin
Black balled by the law Magic Hooligan
the atmosphere where I'm living
As the ancient ways all fade to grays
in power plays that they're giving
Like an atom bomb underneath my skin
Crawling in he dirt Magic Hooligan
So it seems I'm just a casualty of
shattered dreams but I'm grinning
What night has cast upon these halls
Concealing faces in the walls
Portrayed against the grain of sight
Monstrosities that shine at night
Appendages that grow and spine
Vague forms that glow a ghastly shine
Alas unto my bed they crept
Where tangled limbs and organs slept
I try to make you understand
That there are forces in this universe
that you cannot comprehend
XRated beam is in my hand
and when it's pointed at you
You'll change but you won't know when
Witness your parallel in time
For this is a more than senseless crime
I try and make you see the light
And when it's shining through you
you'll burn into the next century
No need to count no need to find
that such my learned friend
Abuses just feed technology
This is the animal inside
Resistance is always pacified
This is the end of all you know
To witness the one that steals the show
I try to make you understand
That there are forces in this universe
that you cannot comprehend
XRated demons in my hand
and when it's pointed at you
You'll change but you won't know when
Witness your parallel in time
For this is a more than senseless crime
This is the end of all you know
A mutated animation grows
This oblong box I owe my birth
Like I'm the last man on this earth
Another journey into fear
The cry of banshees getting clear
The mask of Red Death never weeps
And creeping while the city sleeps
Relaxing on a bed of nails
The mad magician never fails
Despite the ravages of time
The Tingler's creeping up my spine
The house of Usher's falling down
The Raven claws his thistled crown
And talks to spirits of the dead
The madman's diary has been read
These tales of terror never end
As Dr Phibes rises again
Amidst the burnedout minds
Automatons and their mimes
Their ignorance is clear
The learningcurve's severe
The chasm's opened wide
The blind leading the blind
This generation's doomed
Sucked back into the womb
Programmed children stare with vacant minds
Pixilated landscapes fill their eyes
Interfacing clouds binary brains
Grotesque applications numb the pain
Algorithmic memories fill the air
Girls with psychic implants in their hair
You can see it growing everywhere
Cryptic messages sent from coded brains
Memory cells are useless just the same
Thought you'd never come down from the trees
RangeGuides soon arrive on DeathMachines
Legends were born from this story
Accounts of this story are varied
And the winds blew us right over the trees
And the ancestors returned on their knees
Smoldering insects did scurry
Smashing stones digging bones
Where the unknown are buried
Accounts of this story are varied
And the boards started to smolder again
Burning bones over the insects and men
But then warriors don't age well as it seems
When they shower you with mortgages and dreams
Was it something that you found
That made you turn around
Knocked you off your throne left me here alone
Monstrous winds claim for their homeland
Defied everything that stands still
Is hit by the cold in their hearts
Sung is this desolating
Victory by the dead trees and the
Troubling choirs of tortured wind
Enchanting melodies of the Dark
Beyond the magnanimity
Of white snow's claimed purple gardens
One grand crystal palace was built
Symbol of the ruling of death
Hidden in a crystalline room
Stands the only living flower
Trapped in a magic box of the
Only ice beholder of a spark
Lost once more I don't know where to go
Lost the sacred memory
I forgot where am I from
One broken branch from the grapevine
Lost my only heart's bed
No where can he rest all peacefully laid
Another lost wanderer was born
How could I lose myself so easily
Behold the magic
From Gaia's darkest child's
Relentless lips
Kissing all your sins
Seduced I finally
Stood still against the wind
My heart was not cold
My heart was no more
In the realm of ForeverNight
My one and one and only my only heart is lost
The only thing for me to do is to
Free the last flower from its wicked prison
Beyond snow's invaded lands
An infant hides and stares at the sky
Covered by the dying clouds
Of greyness and of emptiness
Beyond the ForeverNight
An infant deprived from her heart
Gets up and begins his last walk
She's heading for the crystal palace
where her last hope still lives
Just a walk the one one last hope stands
Forgetting all the rules refusing to conform
I'm a prey in the grey
Oh why should I obey
You're lost in the deep disarray
One last try to one day scream victory VICTORY
One more lost soul
Now left with no colors
A dead flower
Who never saw summer
Where art thou hidden colors
Thou mystic shades of life
Can a dream still breathe
after dying so many times
Nothing left to give
All yet to be born
Dying rules from Earth
For the rise of my dreams
Seeking the Moonlight
Teachings from the sea
Listen to thy heart
And claim thy glory and sing this song
One fantastic Quest for a new paradise
One day no more I could give
To this world like an empty bottle
Tearing my heart for this song
Is just not a routine
One day no more I could feel
For this world when the last hope shall die
The final countdown has begun
But how long will it last
For the love and for the passion beyond the skin
For the burning desire to unveil the mystery
From all the pain left with only a stain
Could only be cleaned by the truest lover's kiss
One last dream to share
One more soul to harvest
One more try to
One day scream victory
Breathing honesty
Bring me close to thee
Dying rules from Earth
For the rise of my dreams
I am not from a gutter
Even though it feels like it
I do not wish to murder
So why should I sing about it
Dragons no more ride their wings
And I'm not the one lie
Satelliteillusions of stars shining
Makes me want to cry
What's the true feeling of total liberation
Is a body deserted when it feels no more pain
I still forever remember
the first time I heard
delightful sounds of hope
and the fire burning the rope
I could not hide my tears away
from this divine beauty
it feels like I had never
lost my heart at all
Waves of passionate tenderness
Angel of all angels lending me her shoulder
Mystical garden growing in the Dark
I still forever remember
the feeling I had
of a new world revealing
and its dawning dream
I discovered
a very long lost child
who opened his eyes
and was inspired by the Moonlight
Waves of passionate tenderness
Angel of all angels lending me her shoulder
Mystical garden growing in the Dark
Take my hand
I will never let you fall again
Lay your head on my breast
I need you to feel my beating heart
Closely in you
So many tears were shed
Like rivers who cannot find rain
So many frozen dreams
Broken by the tortured wind
But all this time it was there
The misty sounds of the deep sea
And now by the snow its melody echoes oh oh
Making its way to my ears
Never will a snow flake
Lay again in purple gardens
Never will one living wonder
Be all alone again
Beyond this ForeverNight
The dead grey fades away
Beyond the nights crisped sky
The Moonlight gently smiles
Closely in me
Take my hand
I will never let you fall again
Lay your head on my breast
I need you to feel my beating heart
Closely into your frail body
So many mysteries
Lies in the seas Cruel Beauties
So many living wonders
Sing their dreams to others
Never will I doubt again
The return of the rain
Never will I feel again
The fear of the Crystal pain
Beyond her motherly hands
Is where all the beauty stands
Beyond her comforting breast
My heart found a place to rest
Oh what a night
Dancing with the romantic breeze of spring
Feels like I could fly with my wings
My new purple wings
Oh what a site
Dandelions play with me in the park
Feels like my eyes now hold a spark
A new mystic spark
Sing once again with me the melancholy
And all the things we cannot see
Just how seldom is our wisdom
Oh what a smile
A child has when his daddy comes back from work
The child doesn't see hes gone berserk
There's too much work
Oh what a scream
A child makes when some monsters shakes its bed
Their teeth are brown their eyes are red
And I think it sounds fun
Sing once again with me the melancholy
And all the things we cannot see
Just how seldom is our wisdom
To dance with me where the Moonlight shines
Oh what a spell
Changes city parks into magic realms
Lets not say who is the lovely witch
Behind all of this
Sing once again with me the melancholy
And all the things we cannot see
Just how seldom is our wisdom
Alright tonight we will climb to the sky
We will ride the stars tonight
I flee
And you fly
We fly
Tonight
In the sky
Tonight
We'll ride the stars
So far
Waiting
Midnight to ring
A melody that makes the big monsters sleepy
Flying
In new born spring
We sing
The hymn
Of new born stars
A melody playing with the feeling
Of when Midnight Rings
A magic kingdom
Unveils to my wide eyes
Revealing to me
How to ride the stars
Just hold on tight and
Don't close your eyes
You will soon see the Moonlight
Night's only ray of light
Stepped into a beginning tale
Where it is Forever the Night
Maybe I will live enough to tell
A story from so far so close to the heart
Rainbow petals twirling in the night
A garden growing in the dark
Responding choirs from the stars
Magical voices heard about everywhere
Hiding so softly just for a moment
Safely away all alone to play
Stepped into an enchanting tale
Where the wind blows into its flute
Where trees play harp so magically
Into the woods of ForgottenLands
A small tribe stands around a fire
Accompanying the melody
Accompanied by an unknown voice
Hiding so softly just for a moment
Safely away all alone to play
Far away around the fire
Tribal Dreams humble fantasies
Suddenly
The Moonlight shines to me
It reaches me into my humble bedroom
Suddenly
I feel that I could flee
Magically
It seems that I can see
All the eyes from forests that never dies
Suddenly
The tears fall into me
Through the trees on the ground
Lies the light sought for so long
Through the branches and the caves
Sings a voice with unknown words
Suddenly
Seems a voice into me
Sings to me in unspoken tongues
Magically
Her words I can now see
Telling me
Soon you will see the sea
Fly the sky and ride the stars
Telling me
She is Eternity
Suddenly
She opened all my ears
And I heard such wonders
I have heard
Enchanting melodies
From the roses and from the thunder
This is all
That I can make of it
This is all that I can make of it
An infant stares at the sky
Covered by the Starlights
Amazement fills his sparkly eyes
An infant learns to smile again
Covered by the gentle Moonlight
All of his sorrows were not in vain
feeling so safely naked
Finally the clouds are exploding
Down down the rain is pouring
Hearing new colored birds sing
And fantasies breathing
Landed in a dream of deep enchantments
Overwhelmed by new warmth into my chest
Feelings of pleasure running into my body
I open my eyes and forever let go
An infant bathes in the light
Covered by Moon's serenity
Feeling that with his wings to fly he might
a universe where
Wilderness is full of wisdom
And where the wisdom is wild
Where Angels are better seductress
Then Gaia's darker child's
now that my garden richly grows
Deep in your dreams
Something is closing you
No way to run
No place to hide
From the bringer of never ending night
Now the darkness surrounds you
The horror circus is here for you
Don't ever close your eyes
Never fall into sleep
Don't ever close your eyes
In your darkest world made by yourself
Something is calling at you
You try to scream from the black
You're lost forever and never coming back
Never close your eyes
Never follow the fear
because that's where I hide
It's waiting for the time to come
To strike without a warning
Faceless shadow crawling inside your mind
And eating everything what you left behind
Scavenger of evil
Like a devil in disguise
You can't see the truth before it's too late
It's hiding behind the lies
Scavenger of evil
It's still waiting for the time to come
To spread the wings of eternal hunger
Scavenger of evil
My hands are reaching out to you
You can feel the chill from the afterlife
Now I'm taking you back to the dark past
My hands are pulling you down
Down to the place where all things happened
No chance to turn back the dead time
It was here where I died
Ghost of the nightfall
Among the dead I stand
Ghost of the nightfall
Among the dead I stand
Now you see what I am
Now you see what I am
Now you see what I am bitch
Somewhere beyond the frontiers of reality
I see you standing in coldness
Deep in a secret place that time forgot
You're trapped in a world unknown
Where daylight is dead and gone
I see you waiting in the coldness
Down in a watery grave so alone
In dark water dreams
Your calls haunt my sleep
In dark water dreams
Your cries haunt my sleep
Silent night the devil's night
In my dark water dreams
Silent night the devil's night
I see you reaching for the light
Silent night the devil's night
I hear your screams of fright
In dark water dreams
Pain filled screams still echo in the night
In the place where time stands still
Under the cold stare of pale moonlight
Something's waiting in the dark coldness
What lies beneath
What lies beneath the moor
What lies beneath
What lies beneath the moor
Every time when night falls down
In silence of the dead
You can hear them in your head
They're playing with your mind why
Pain filled screams breaking through the time
In a place where time stands still
They're playing with your mind WHY
Here I am waiting for you
In the dark place of my memories
It's been a long time since you disappeared
But I still hear you in the wind
Or am I dreaming
A cold wind blows right through my mind
I feel you standing close to me
Now I return where we used to be
Back to the place that holds the key to the past
Into the shadows
Into the silence of the cemetery
Into the shadows
Into the silence of the cemetery
That's where I'm waiting for you
That's where we belong
They disappeared without a trace
In the darkest hour of the night
The grim secret baptized in blood
It's hiding down where the sun dies
Somewhere out in the darkness
Something cold is still waiting
Every time when light of the day comes down
Something comes alive alive
They're crawling back to your world
When the night time when the night time is here
They're rising from the endless night
Back from the cold grave
They're shining in the endless night
They disappeared without a trace
In the darkest hour of the night
Beneath darkened trees
They were buried down to the hallowed ground
Somewhere deep in the silence
They're cursed by the nocturnal spell
Every time when the darkness kills the daylight
They'll rise they'll rise
Through the years
Through the time
You ruled the kingdom of unholy lies
Two faced devil
Two faced devil
Now time has come to the whole world to see
When your glorious life starts to bleed
No angel of mercy can save you now
Because your time's racing like wind
Nothing can save you now
You're going down
Nothing can save you now
You two faced devil
You try to run away
Away from your past
Your end is here to stay at last
It's too late to hide your face
Because You`re painted with your own shit
Nothing at all
Your past is driving you into the early grave
Fucker
Make my bad dreams go away
Or I won't make it through this night
I'm slowly drifting away from you
And never coming back again
Make the voices go away
They're getting louder every day
In my room where walls are closing in
I can't escape anymore oh no
Every night I wake up screaming
But you can't hear me at all
Every night I wake up screaming
Make my bad dreams disappear
Or I will never see the light of day
This time they're taking me away
Into the world of everscreams
Every night I wake up screaming
But nobody hears me at all
All in all different poles go with the crowd
Heavenly hypocrisy what you gonna swing
Many of them make it big out of cheating
Humiliate cannot wait cut in your turn
In cahoots with others stick the boot in
But quickly to misery they can return
Easy comes you have a boost
But the chickens come home to roost
For your behavior you have to account
You reap what you sow
That what they have can get lost completely
Even then stubborn men keep up this line
Choice been made who to blame this is the line
Easy comes you have a boost
But the chickens come home to roost
For your behavior you have to account
You reap what you sow
Vanished tomorrow
Fire in the sky
I feel the pain
This pain shall last
Corrupted Gods
Crosses will burn
Divine mistake
A dead mankind
Crosses will burn
Burn
Every corner I see
Betrayal disrespect
Envy corruption
Unexpected punishment
Our lost souls
Outside our bodies
Without a fate
In the fucking darkness
Wars and conflict
Pestilence disease
Infesting the Earth
Crosses shall burn
Vanished tomorrow
Fire in the sky
I feel the pain
This pain shall last
Corrupted Gods
Crosses will burn
Divine mistake
A dead mankind
Wars and conflict
Pestilence disease
Infesting the Earth
Crosses shall burn
A dead mankind
Infesting the Earth
Divine mistake
Crosses shall burn
In the eyes of the killer they stand
In the vision of the murderer they shall die
In the eyes of the killer they stand
In his plains in his aim they stand
They become these new victims of his madness
Psychotic eyes of the one who shall kill
Every one who believes in a god
In the eyes of the killer
In his life there has left a pleasure to kill
In their life death becomes the next door
Eyes of fire certain strength made of steel
And they become only victims of his will
In the eyes of the killer
I don't believe in you
Fuck off what you're gonna do
Your truth is a lie
I'm gonna shoot your eyes
What do you represent
Who are your friends
Fuck you
You mean shit
Fuck you
You mean shit
You make me sick
You make me shit
You make me laugh
You mean hypocrisy
I don't trust you
Call me what you want and fuck you
Your life is a lie
You should open your eyes
What do you represent
Who are your friends
Fuck you
You mean shit
Fuck you
You mean shit
You make me sick
You make me shit
You make me laugh
You mean hypocrisy
Revolt inside the walls
Revolt with no end
I must kill them all
No one shall stand
Unleashing all anger
Unleashing all pain
I'm the coldest murder
He escapes in vain
This time there's no choice
This time there's no escape for them
This time we win and celebrate
This time the last enemy won't stand
Die die
I'll watch you bleeding
Die die
I'll watch you begging
Die die
I'll watch you suffering
Die die
Yes I'll watch you dying
So long we've waited
To take this power
So long we've watched
This rising empire
This time for revolt
This time for war
They beg for mercy
We claim for more
This time there's no choice
This time there's no escape for them
This time we win and celebrate
This time the last enemy won't stand
Die die
I'll watch you bleeding
Die die
I'll watch you begging
Die die
I'll watch you suffering
Die die
Yes I'll watch you dying
Revolt inside the walls
Revolt with no end
I must kill them all
No one shall stand
Unleashing all anger
Unleashing all pain
The killing is complete
Even you won't stand
This time there's no choice
This time there's no escape for them
This time we win and celebrate
This time the last enemy won't stand
Blind

Blind but still breathing
Blind but alive

For I am the one who leads the blind
When strength is over
Blind leads the blind
Corruption

Endless corruption
Kingdom of the blind

Lambs with no sight
Blind leads the blind

Ways of perversion
Ways of death and crime
Blind leads the blind
Blind leads the blind
Dead
This time they're all dead
For I am the one who leads the blind
When strength is over
Blind leads the blind

Global decadence fatal vengeance
Natural holocaust Earth in suicide
Degradation
Annihilation
Devastation
Over population
The old legend is back
The fate is coming
Violent and fast destroying and fucking
Just like a guillotine is your neck
Degradation
Annihilation
Devastation
Over population
You may think you already killed me
You take care with these things that you think
You should look at your back sometimes
You will find all those ones your left behind
You forgot that you left me bleeding to death
You forgot that you shoot me a hundred times
But you should have waited longer to see
That death didn't want to bring me
Not dead yet
Not dead yet
Your should start to think about running away
You should keep your eyes opened night and day
Now it's time for me to be the hunter
Now it's time for me to be the killer
Should I call you now a victim
Should I call you now a prey
There's no turning point this time my friend
You are a dead man anyway
Not dead yet
Not dead yet
No fate no fear no hope
From pain from dust from blood
No chance no fake no lie
From dark from hate from fight
No trust no judge no fuck
From crime from rage from force
No shame no pride no rise
From Evil from fire from high
Let's kill again
Let's kill them all
Chaos and riot
Down the liars
Chaos and riot
Down the liars
Betrayer full of lies
Betrayer I see your fucking life
No fate no fear no hope
From pain from dust from blood
No chance no fake no lie
From dark from hate from fight
No trust no judge no fuck
From crime from rage from force
No shame no pride no rise
From Evil from fire from high
Let's kill again
Let's kill them all
Chaos and riot
Down the liars
Chaos and riot
Down the liars
Betrayer full of lies
Betrayer I see your fucking life
Behind these walls
Rottenness reigns unique
The seeds of hate
Arise all the time
Hostility
Reigns more and more
This is a cancer
With no cure
The machine
Commands poverty
In a dead
And archaic world
Ignorance
Got spread in the masses
As the flames
Burn in the ashes
Behind these walls
Rottenness reigns unique
The seeds of hate
Arise all the time
Hostility
Reigns more and more
This is a cancer
With no cure
Growing and taking clear shape

So come with us on a journey to irrationality
Dreams and history the adventure of your life
That's where hope means everything
You've always had the gift to make people smile
You rest inside yourself so naturally
But that's why you mean so much to me
Your eyes are curious and so is your mind
You want to understand the nature of all things
You're such an artist in everything you do
It is a blessing to be loved by you
You left me broken
Torn up inside
And the sky has darkened
Like I'm buried alive
This scar won't stop to bleed
But I can't make a sound
Try to say what I feel
But nothing comes out
How did it come to this
I'm trapped behind these walls
I got no air to breathe
It's like I'm under water
Can you hear me
My silent scream
Can you hear me
My silent scream
Try to reach the surface
But something pulls me down
And there's a voice within
Dying to come out
In the corners of my head
The silence is so loud
How did it come to this
I'm trapped behind these walls
I got no air to breathe
It's like I'm under water
Can you hear me
My silent scream
Can you hear me
My silent scream
Calling for you
But I can't break through
Will I be rescued
Before it's too late
How did it come to this
I'm trapped behind these walls
I got no air to breathe
It's like I'm under water
Can you hear me
My silent scream
Can you hear me
My silent scream
Once upon a time there was
A planet so tiny and blue
It was the perfect place to be
But one life form on it wanted more
But they don't see that it's half past twelve
To turn a blind eye is the easier way
As long as they feel safe in their beds
There's no need to wake up from their dream
But the truth no longer hides
They must see what they'll leave behind
Wake up mankind your time is running out
Now the planet is striking back
And of course the lamenting is big
Global warming pollution as well
Is not enough to make them understand
That now is the time to change
Their behaviour and world's fate
Wake up mankind your time is running out
My thoughts are bothering me
There's no sleep this night
Will be strong enough to rule the land
After this I'll never be the same again
My whole life I was prepared for this one day
I was born with this dignity
I will lead them to victory
Face the day with serenity
It's a matter of destiny
Come what may I will do my best
To banish the eternal night
When the morning come I'll be the next queen
I must lead thousands to an unknown fate
I know they'll follow me wherever I may go
And it's pressing heavily upon my heart
I was born with this dignity
I will lead them to victory
Face the day with serenity
It's a matter of destiny
Come what may I will do my best
To banish the eternal night
Now the moment is here
I'm on the crucial walk
A thousand eyes are following
My steps towards the sword
Forged by the Gods
I was born with this dignity
I will lead them to victory
In my heart and my soul I know
That's the way that I have to go
Face the day with serenity
It's a matter of destiny
Come what may I will do my best
Because I know there's no time to take a rest
I've been feeling so uncertain
Since the day you left my life
Now I'm standing at the crossroads
No direction left to go
I've been thinking 'bout the good times
And I've cried a lake of tears
If losing you is just a nightmare
I hope I wake up by your side
Farewell my love
Forgive the things I've done to you
May your days be warm and bright
May your journey lead you to the light
So many words been left unspoken
And some words were far too much
Maybe sometimes love is hurting
But it's the sweetest pain I know
Farewell my love
Forgive the things I've done to you
May your days be warm and bright
May your journey lead you to the light
Farewell my love
Forgive the things I've done to you
May your days be warm and bright
May your journey lead you to the light
Ooh farewell my love my love/goodbye
Forgive the things I've done to you
May your days be warm and bright
In times of fear and loss of staving and of pain
They are the chosen ones oh can't you see
Born to bring the light and end the misery
The seed of hope is sown it's time for bravery
They are the chosen ones oh can't you see
Born to bring the light and end the misery
Seasons are changing so is mankind
Feelings unbound setting free our minds
What does mankind want What do they need
We all want somebody to trust in
Someone to follow who lead us in hard times
They are the chosen ones oh can't you see
Born to bring the light and end the misery
Broken heart broken dreams
No idea of what love means
A girl on the run with much hope left inside
Shes alone that night but the starlight guides
Her small steps on this road leading back to you
Shes a fighter burns brighter
The heart of a lion
And shes trying to get over you my friend
Shes a dreamer believer
Her faith doesn't leave her
You're no longer part of her life oh no
No more fear no more lies
No more tears in her eyes
A new day has come with new chances in sight
She's a fighter burns brighter
The heart of a lion
And shes trying to get over you my friend
She's a dreamer believer
Her faith doesn't leave her
You're no longer part of her life oh no
Don't you keep waiting
You can't hold her tight
She's a leaf in the wind she's broken her chains
Shes a fighter burns brighter
The heart of a lion
And shes trying to get over you my friend
She's a dreamer believer
Her faith doesn't leave her
You're no longer part of her life oh no
Into the dissonance I fall
Carried by an instant force
Craving for our harmony
But playing the odds
I see a light in the tunnel
But I step to the left
Put my hands to my hips
And do the dance
I cannot hear you Ground Control
And it seems they cut the rope
Weightless I seem to fall
And it feels so good
Into the dissonance I fall
And I don't wanna lose control
But every moment I enjoy
Will keep the dissonance
Yes life was good to me I know
And I don't wanna let it go
I will come back soon
And try again
I'd be a raving fool to say
But I wish it all away
Yes I knew the consequences
Like I knew the gains
So do you think I'm out of tune
All these tones don't fit the song
Just a little melody
In a much bigger symphony
Into the dissonance I fall
And I don't wanna let it go
But every moment I enjoy
Will keep it dissonant
Set me free
Please could you exorcise me
And I start again please
Help me 
There is no place for me
Here in this lunacy
Its getting harder to breathe
And hold my screams
I might've made it through
If I'd just talked with you
Now it's too late to pursue
Or hold this dream
Oh but I'd love to fly
Up to the starry sky
Step through the open door
Let the winds of heaven roar
I might've been someone
But I was on the run
Now that it's said and done
I'm free to stop
Oh but I'd love to fly
To to the starry sky
Step through the open door
Let the winds of heaven roar
100 years we are bound on this spell
Lovers separated in a cruel way
What did we do to deserve such a fate
Somebody free us before it's too late
I'm the falcon and you are the wolf
Never human shape at the same time
Each dawn some minutes is all that remains
I fear the daylight
With the first sunshine I spend my wings
Watching over you and every step you take
At night I can't sleep know you are near
I'm the falcon and you are the wolf
Never human shape at the same time
Each dawn some minutes is all that remains
I fear the daylight
Lied to my face callous embrace
Your medicine now how's that taste
Stir the pot parting shot do I care Probably not
You have no place here I make my own luck
Lied to my face callous embrace
Your medicine now how's that taste
Stir the pot parting shot do I care Probably not
Third time I'm lucky three times the charm
I'm in the middle where the storm is calm
now I am dangerous now I am armed
don't get this twisted I do mean you harm
No one will cry when your blood has been spilled
I'm a bastard an orphan denied by creator
If I am a God then you'll meet your Unmaker
The sickest motherfucker you've ever seen
I'd wipe the slate clean and shatter the dream
destroy any trace where your foul flesh has been
Decisions decisions I'll make my incisions
FUCK THAT
Six years
Sick fears
But hailed as a messiah
No more shit from these weak motherfuckers
Claim my crown from this weak controller
Your reign's over it's game over
These words will stand the test of time
I'll be remembered long after you're gone
I refuse to walk the line
You'll be dismembered six feet under the ground
I am everything and you are nothing
Light the fuse and the ignition
Eliminate the competition
Battered beaten to submission
Decomposition
You will see my true ambition
When you hear my composition
This is now a demolition
Redefinition
You think I'll watch when you take my crown
You think I'll sink when you want me to drown
Pretenders to the throne
Bloated sitting on a throne of false promises
Your reign is done its been way too long
You didn't want this you didn't plan for this
But you fucking deserve it
Once more into the breach my friends
Once more into the breach
Prepare to meet your ends
I don't think I just do it
Nothing left to say
This is now a Regicide
Actions over words
We will overcome this
Stranglehold releasing
You've become what I despise
Eliminate authority
Dethrone your lies feeding bullshit
Purify all your filthy falsehood
Dealt our hand left to struggle
Bend the lines crush these fucking shackles
Without a sound never be found
I am a beast I'm unbound
My words are profound
I am a king yet uncrowned
I'm something you could never be
You tried to cut us down
But I'll come right back
And burn you motherfuckers to the ground
Violence is my solution
Destroy invade and execution
Through death my will be done
The sins of the Father
This is not a test
I'll destroy your best
Fucking maggots
This is not a test
You're all fucking maggots
On this throne I'll stay
This could have been yours
But you threw it away
You're nothing but a shallow bloated whore
Violence is my solution
Destroy invade and execution
Through death my will be done
Through death my will be done
Exiled reviled and left aside
thrown out and beaten to the ground
Get back here cunt I'm here to stay
The strength to go for one more round
But Feared by All
Revered by None
No one stands above me I am the end armageddon
Yet Feared by All
No one stands above me I am the end armageddon
Not for the fame or glory
Just because i love the thrill
Never stopping
Never stopping till i reach my goal
Never ending
Never ending frenzy lost control
And now the pattern's shifting
Motives becoming clear
Settling the score now this is my retribution
Ice cold killer systematic execution
Unleashed
Unchained
Released from all your shackles
Apex predator
Lions don't fear jackals
Kill
This is the endgame
So prepare to kill
I usurper 
Born to hurt you born to kill
A true berserker
Defeating beating never sleeping
One by one
You'll get a beasting
Bitch i told you
This is closure
Friends are close
My enemies closer
Domination through cremation
Fucked and twisted
I'm your creation
I'll bring this to a head
Now's our time to take the reigns
I'll take what's mine you're dead
Just know that you're to blame
This is the end of an era
Your deeds and actions couldn't be any clearer
Your story has no more words
They say the pen is mightier than the sword
How can you be a king when you are just a corpse
You can't be better you're inherently worse
Applying force to the source
Your murder I'll endorse with no remorse
You're just a morsal bitch
And i'm the main course
The normal rules do not apply
You'll watch me rise I'll see you die
This is your reckoning
This is my shot
How can you look down on me
If i'm at the top
This is your reckoning
This is my shot
How can you look down on me
If i'm at the top
The fear when you realize what
the children you left behind have become
We're fucking murderers
Kill
This is the endgame
So prepare to kill
This is the endgame
Now it's time to kill
This is the endgame
So prepare to kill
This is the endgame
Now it's time to kill
KillTake a step back  try to
Remember what you believe in
What drives you to be who you are
Why cover it up  deny it
Embrace the aspirations
Look forward to a new beginning
Swallowed up by your desolation
Consumed by an infestation
Temptation
Choked at the peak of my arbitration
Constant selfish visions
My mind is filled with filth
I've been down in the circles of Hell
Been crushed by the weight of the world
Three years I have been asleep asleep
A flesh prison trapped inside of me
I am the reason you are so angry
I am the reason you won't succeed
I have the weight of the world
On my shoulders
So much that I can
Hardly bare it
Stop breathing down my neck  lurking
Time to rid myself of this sick disease
 free myself from this horrid feeling
My mind's in a cage
Screaming to be let free
I will overcome
Anything  everything
That stands in my way 
No one
No one can hold me back
Illusions in my head
Cowering from my awakening
I am free from this painSlit Your Stomach 
Open 
Reaching in to the womb 
Extract entrails 
Slowly removing the skin 
Violently convulsing 
Watching me take your life 
Away Dissecting 
The entrails
Dissecting the 
Entrails 
Disemboweling you with my knife 
Carving 
Out 
Yours 
Intestines 
Screaming for mercy but youll receive none 
Dissecting the Entrails 
The last thing youll see is me 
Duct Tape Gag and Tied To the Table 
Fight for Your Life but youre not able 
Eradicating with no homage 
Death calls as you fall unconscious  
Dissecting the entrails
Feeding frenzy 
Impulse gauging 
Vile substance 
Im consuming  
Ripping tearing 
Threw her 
In sides 
Trying to retrieve the afterBirth
Feeding frenzy 
Impulse gauging 
Vile substance 
Im consuming  
 Sensational urges inside of me 
I cant resist 
The essence of your life will embellish mine 
Immortality 
Pulling out the afterbirth eat of the placenta  
It is key to life I cant keep it down 
Disgorge 
From in my throat 
Filling me with life 
Consume the after birth
Youre not the first
Youre not the last
No Name
Like The Rest In The Past
So Innocent
So Pure
So sweet
Now Dead To Me
Consume by my will I must kill
Take from you prestige innocence away
Spread your legs wide open
Bust threw your hymen
Seepage of serenity
Pound out your virginity
Begging me for mercy Shut The Fuck Up
Grind my dick threw your anatomy
Sensational urges tell me
Mangle up your cunt viciously
Eradicate your snatch completely
Horror stains my sanity 
Ascend into sovereignty 
Annihilate those weaker than me 
Survive if I let them be 
Loyal to a false nation 
Kill with no hesitation 
Storming the opposition 
Impaled those resist 
Grotesquely Butchered on the frontlines 
Justify to crucify a nation 
All for the loyalty Innocent war fatalities 
A soldier left with no mission 
Vile impudence has pledge me 
I Cant Stop Killing the Weak Beings
In disgust youre cleanse a must 
Reflection of the horror to be 
Images that stain my sanity 
Emboweled by my hate for thee 
Dont be a hero die a coward 
Violently tearing your anatomy I endeavor 
Dont be a hero die a coward 
The war is still gone but Im Still He
Sticking the chainsaw in her cunt
Pounding her pussy grinding her guts
Molesting her body with my saw
Leaving your body dead and marled
Stick the chainsaw in her cunt
Try to run but you Ill find
Your sweet vagina is on my mind
Scream for god as I corner you
I cant wait to get deep in you
Stick the chainsaw deep within
Ripping and tearing your vagina skin
Our foreplay is with a knife
Come on baby I know youll like
Chainsaw
Pull my chord to start my saw
Keep on screaming no one hears your call
Cunt
Upon insertion you scream in pain
My sexual pleasure gained
Try to fight but deep down I know you like
Now your bent spread open wide
Grinding your cunt from behind
My saw submerged in your snatch
Pounding so hard I broke your back
Scream in pain but I know its pleasure
Im the biggest piece you measured
Even though youre dead I keep thrusting
From your vaginal skin my saw is rusting
You lead a life of celibacy 
For your love a deity 
Your hymen kept in tact just for me 
I cant wait to hear you scream 
Raped with a crucifix 
Your services help to spread his lie 
So Ill help to spread your legs 
This pain Im inflicting is a must 
Stripped from the cloth and tied to the bed 
This crucifix hangs above our heads 
Tear down the cross with hate and disgust 
In your vagina I must thrust 
Scream gods name as I ram it in 
Ripping and tearing through your hymen 
A statue of Christ crucified 
You sure lost your faith real fast 
As I pull your entails out of your ass 
Now you scream in pain in my pants I just came 
Now you know first hand of sin 
With the crucifix deep with in 
Now you scream to the sky why God why
Why do dead girls call out to me
My sexual urges I need to feed
Having sex with dead girls I dare
I know its not right but I dont care
Sift threw thousands of dead rotting sluts
To find one wholl male me nut
More beautiful when theyre dead
Pushing threw the maggots with my dick head
I love it when their flesh rots
Coagulated blood covers my cock
It feels so good with my dick in
Aroused only by rotting skin   
Rigamortis has set in
Pussy is hard as my dick I know 
Its sick but for some reason I must lick
Fighting with the maggots over the treat
Now chewing on her cold sweet vaginal meat
From there pussy in trail I will fist out
So many girls that I lost count
Violently raping every oralfiss
Your rotting pussy Im sure I will miss
Stick in the head this I know
My sanity no longer holds
Screaming as youre tied to the bed 
Futile to resist you're soon be dead 
Yea baby I like a little fight 
Pound out your teeth so you cant bit
My dick in your mouth tears in your eyes
My cum and your blood seeps out the sides
I am not learning without trophy in hand
So many other women I have collected
Your pussy I carefully dissect
Your ever oral vases my dick will infect 
Run my scalpel over pussy 
Mouth is watering your mice and juice
I love it when your eyes get wide
My knife plunged deep inside 
Hold your vagina in my hand and
Fuck it while youre alive
Ejaculating to the tears you cry
You bitch dont disrespect me
Your about to see another side of me 
Wrapped in Saran wrap hanging from ceiling 
From your anus my semen is spilling
I have already warned you one too many times
Fucking bitch your gonna die
Real fucking tired of you disrespecting me
Dont try to beg and plead
As if Im not knowing Im not stupid
You think Im not knowing Your fucking stupid
Wrap you in saran wrap
Your not laughing now bitch
No disrespecting now bitch
My dick is tearing your ass you fucking whore
Left helpless and twitching
From the violent heavy ass pounding
Your ass dripping my cum
Now its time to start the killing
I dont care forget the feelings
Stabbing the bitch again and again
Sodomizing my wife with the knife
Stabbing the bitch again and again
Disrespecting me lost her life
Your about to see another side of me
I'm not so so puncturing and cynical
Homesick wish list pathogenic populace
But there's no perfect it's all hit and miss
Don't try to disinfect my personality
I like my edges rough I like offending
Maybe I'm full of shit or full of envy
One day you'll stare at me but not judgmentally
An antiseptic sound is just what bores me
I'll show you just how difficult I can be
But my opinion might be the enemy
I'm so surrounded by this urban pharmacy
It gets the best of you it got the best of me
It always piles up when I thought I was done
I feel like Hunter S I just don't have a gun
One day you'll stare at me but not judgmentally
An antiseptic sound is just what bores me
I'll show you just how difficult I can be
But my opinion might be the enemy
With A Sudden Halt of the Great Machine
Come Men of Iron and Steel
Lets Us Prepare You for Bloodshed
Bring Your Sharpened Sabre's to Battle
As I Am the Synergy of War
Unchained By the Oldest God
From the Fortress of the Unconquerable
Chaos
Chaos  Is the Revelation
Chaos  Is the Fire Below
Chaos  Is the Darkness Above
Chaos  Is the Void Beyond
Chaos  Is the End Of Man
Bye
Burn
Bold
Bored
Of watching the same movie
In my head
I remember me in that room
Waiting for the sleep to come
Waiting for minutes
Waiting for hours
Waiting for days
Waiting for a miracle
To wake up from this nightmare
Never stopping to say it's not possible
It's not possible it's not my life
Please take it and give it to the garbage truck
Please take this life
And flush it in the toilets
Throw it into the ocean Burn it all
Bury it six feet under
Give it to your worst enemy
Give my life to your worst enemy Oh no
Give my life
To your worst enemy
I remember me under this public bench
Like a tramp like a motherfuckin' tramp
Drinking alcohol and alcohol
Eating pills and pills
Mixing it Feeling my mind going crazy
Just to forget I remember the cold
I remember the piss
I just earned about your crimes
And just wanted to die
Not even to kill you
Not yet I just wanted to die
And you were laughing
Drinking for other reasons
I remember what you never saw
What you'll never see
What you'll never remember
What you never saw
What you'll never see
What you'll never remember
Then I wanted to kill
I wanted to kill you
I wanted to kill them
I wanted to kill the earth
And after to kill me
I got the picture of you naked
I got the picture of you sucking cocks
I got the picture of you lying to me
I got no more pictures of you now
No more pictures
No more
Bye
I know I didn't say it
Burn
First and last goodbye
Bold
Of having wanted to kill you
Bored
Of watching the same movie
In my head
So now thank you
Thank you so much bastards
All the cum you sent on her face
Was the fuel I need to reach Anchorage
Reaching Anchorage
After you
Criminals are saints
After you
Whores are nurses
After you
I'm not scared at all
After you
Now that I've seen evil
Could it be a life Never reminding
Could it be my life Erase erase
Could it be a life Never reminding
Could it be
Burying my own corpse
After you
Hangmen are friends
After you
Soldiers are tourists
After you
I'm not scared at all
After you
Dead and unbreakable
Let's bury it you'll see your crime
How can I be alive after you
So wash my memory
Would you die for me If I say please
Would you sacrifice
Would you call my name
There's no other way out to live with it
I will knock on you door every night to beg you
I will write your name on the wall everyday
To show you the way
I'll never kill you
I'll tell you
I'll tell you to
I'll tell you how
I'll tell you how to do
On the second day I'll bring you flowers
And the small of the rose will be the last thing
You'll recall when you will be dead
So read you name
Just one please
My hand your blood
Broken army
Face into me
Have you seen it operate
Every soldier
Like a soldier
Got a lack of confidence
Every soldier
Like a liar
Will you shoot him down
You will
For the first time
Yeah you will
Feel the criminal inside
Are you just strong enough
Have you the guts to forget
You were someone before
You will not need your brain
Plug it off
Broken nation
With conviction
Got a land to exterminate
Every soldier
Like a beggar
Prayed for death to stop the hate
Broken army
Face into me
Have you seen it operate
Broken nation
Every soldier
Like a liar
Closed the eyes to the genocide
Broken demise
Official lies
Pushed yourself to suicide
Every soldier
Every liar
TargetEnemiesDESTROY
Destroyed
BuildingsHumansDESTROY
Destroyed
FamilyHomeDESTROY
Are you strong enough to
Get a gun in your mouth
Guilty enough
Blind enough for a new war
It could be easy this suicide
So now take this gun out of your mouth
Push it back
Push it back
When you see every battlefield
Filled with the blood of every soldier
You'll think you'll be the last one on Earth
That could be true
That could be you
But you will never hear silence
You will never hear silence again
There will always be someone behind you
The one you didn't kill
And you'll just head one noise
One noise One fuckin' noise
Shot
My girl my girl
Don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines in the pines
Where the sun
Don't ever shine
I will shiver the whole night through
My girl my girl
Where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
Her husband was a hardworking man
Just about a mile from her
His head was found
In a driving wheel
But his body
Never was found
Some people are sick and other people pay to see
It's time to answer by chaos
Have you seen the TV Have you seen it well
Have you read the news Do you know them by heart
Did you know a man killed his own family
Have you seen what I don't wanna see
No hope for some change to come
No truth to learn just learn to lie
Elsewhere anywhere nowhere
I am an Island
Everybody hurts and everybody cries
It's not a song it's just fucking reality
Have you felt this tears you would like to lick
Would you like to rape Would you like to steal
Do you know the anger Do you know the hatred
Did you know the USA maintain the embargo
Nothing will change until me die
Have you seen the poles Have you seen Kyoto
Not even you can I ever change
Have you seen the fate Have you seen
I am an Island
Where lots have gone
Even me
My Own Private Alaska
I am an Island
Live on
Remember what we're made of
Remember where we came from
Through every rainbow
I'll see you rise
And don't you dare
Touch my hair if you need
To relieve the weight
Of this mother fuckin' guilt
It's so hard to sleep at night
It's so hard to wake up every day
Through every rainbow
I'll see you rise
And don't you dare kiss my face
I will find a solution
Live on
Cause I need it
Pray the lord my soul to keep
In order to survive
In order just to breathe
This is all I can say
This is all I can save
Your fuckin' memory
Cause it'll never be the same
Amen
When you'll be here what will you say
Will you go on lying to me again
You will recall we have died once
On a fucking road on a sunny day
I will remind I could have killed for less
you still could disappear for ever
As we're well mannered
I should not talk like this
But as I died in that car
I just intend to live
Intend to live
Intend to forget
Live with this
Now I saw a light
As we're well mannered
I should not spit like this
But it's your turn to die
I just intend to kill
You we're supposed to love me
You we're supposed to care
You we're supposed to play a part
You we're supposed to
You we're supposed to like the game
you we're supposed to talk
You we're supposed to reinvent
You we're supposed to kiss or kill
Kill me twice
Kiss me first
Let's talk
RIGHT
From a long time you use
Words you don't control
I will teach you their meaning
Let's RIGHT
WALK
From too long you talk
About weapons you don't know
I will learn you how to fight
Name on you
wipe your asshole
With a page of a dictionary
Let's fight
AS FOLKS
It's your last lines
So what will you write what will you write
When you'll be down on your knees
Praying for something softer
So let's stop let's stop this shit
You're not the though guy you think you are
You're tiny tiny boy
So wipe your asshole
With a page of a dictionary
ABCDead
EFGHate
Come back to me
I'm not that made of stones
I'm not the one
Who used to it before
I will be wise
We will live joyfully
The other guys
Will never come for more
But don't ask me where I got this blood
I would have killed
Everyone one our road
We will be quiet
We will be all alone
Don't cut your strings
It's for your own good you know
Outside the world
Is not a place for you
But don't ask me where I got this blood
But don't ask me where I found this knife
Don't be afraid
It's me my love
You think I changed
But God is ours above
I will tie you on our bed
I will tie you on our floor
I will tie you on our walls
I will tie you on our grave
So we'll be together isolated
So you'll learn the word isolate
So we'll be together isolated
For love for God isolate
Just like you and I
Just like you
End
I would never find words for you
Clouds of uncertainty given toward a death
Of the human existence a total demoralization
Bleach the bones of the crownless empty king
A great shadow beyond the world of understanding
Succumb to the foewords of the nameless thing
A bleak nightmare that has never even existed
Come into being with my slow hopeless decay
Denied the fleeting joy of a secondary creation
Prowling in the corners of this another world
As low as you can imagine yourself here
in the deepening decrepitude of imagination
I know you were a human being a long ago
But I also know this death of your loss
As serpents we are come upon the world
As wolves we are come to butcher humanity
Some fools believing in ludicrous things
Dreaming of the plague of our release
There is no life nor shall there be a future
Too many years have passed since the funeral
Of all human understanding of what is real
So many years ages ago feel my heart wrenched
As shadows also we are come upon the world
While our secondary illusion was so long gone
As black wolves we were come upon the lambs
Driving all your dreams into extinction
Inner daemons that burn the churches of the mind
A wailing banshee of a corrupted ancient horde
Bowing down before a castrated weak failed lord
The torches have only just been lit
The fainthearted have only just joined the mob
In your mind another church must be lit
By the hellfire wherein daemonic hearts throb
Daemonic hordes that rise beyond the earth
The crown of destruction lives within us
Daemonic hordes that blaze beneath the world
The crown of destruction is us lords of hell
Ruins within are us when the daemons are gone
Only fear and destruction remains in the world
Cruelly bereft of the fantasy within our minds
The demonic hordes when they will ride
The blaze in the northern sky our dream
So long ago forfeited by the loveless world
Unsanctioned by humanity yet so very real
The dead trees are dancing in our hearts
It's the dawn of the total human holocaust
A lifeless wish against the depraved world
It's the dawn of the total human holocaust
A dreamless sleep a wish to the northern sky
The brotherhood of the black blossoms of doom
Standing alone for a nihilistic endless gloom
Another holocaust beckoning for doom so soon
As the black fucking metal visions here loom
I beheld the eye in the darkness
In the darkness and the cold
I heard the voice from darkness
Of evil and of the cold
Ruined dreams loveless world exists
Accept the downfall of all humanity
Satan's eye is bright in my mind
A loveless sickness eternal
A soul burning so very bright
In the end of all insanity
I beheld you die I laughed at you
You never lived I never lived
Satan's eye is bright in this reality
It burns our hearts into blackened coal
A black metal dream a future benighted
Why do they live they are dead inside
Kirkot on poltettu tuhoomus on tuotu
Murhattu on uskonto ja turhat valheet
Halveksittavat valheet on poltettu
On vain ikuista raivoa tuhoa ja tuskaa
ElÃÂÃÂ¤mÃÂÃÂ¤ tuottaa tuhoa ja tuskaa
Maailma tuottaa tuhoa ja tuskaa
TÃÂÃÂ¤mÃÂÃÂ¤ maailma on kuin kuoleman ydin
Joka raivon hengessÃÂÃÂ¤ teurastaa
TÃÂÃÂ¤ytetty paskalla jota ihmisiksi sanotaan
Maailma ilman tuhoa raivoa ja tuskaa
on kuin maailma ilman juutalaishuoria
Muslimeita ja kristittyjÃÂÃÂ¤ samaa sakkia
Maailma ilman tuhoa ja tuskaa
A sought after knowledge of what he might say
What would he see and what would he say
Annihilation of the human debris
The extinction of this failed mankind
Downtrodden sickness amongst the people
Who never wanted heroes only death
If there was life beyond death only ash remains
If there was hate beyond life only dust remains
A long damnation of the self and of philosophy
That has never grown a decent human being
A road that was strewn with crucified ones
A heaven that bled with the rotten ones above
Created lords that never really existed
As also the nihilistic followers of nothingness
Inside
But what you don't know is
Her spirit is not EVIL nor is it GOOD
All it wants is to make things right again
And Abigail can find her final peace
I O'Brian have spoken
Let it be done
18 was yesterday today she was
A woman in every single way
Abigail was wathing in the forest where
The darkness it seems to be alive
It was hours ago that she left her home
And now in the darkest night a storm was born
And Abigail she did not know she was its prey
In the storm itself a monster came alive
Chasing Abigail lightning from the sky
Ah then her face turned white
Never did she see the EYE that cried
Turning red
Oh no  Let me go back to my home  Oh no  Oh
God he looked away the night the storm it came
And Abigail was drawn into the rain
Rain was pulling on her hair
To where there is a mansion THE LAIR
Lurking in the dark when lightning struck again
The mansion showed itself in silhouette
Ah rusty iron gates
This is where the Little One she waits
Turning red
Oh no  Let me go back to my home  Oh no  Oh
Abigail wondering why she was
Mummified a lantern in her hand
And in the light she saw a name Cound de La Fey
Mansion in Sorrow mansion in the dark
Maybe tomorrow the Devil's mark
The gates were locked from the inside
And Abigail was sure to die
Then Little One went straight through her body
And the gates they opened wide
Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark
Maybe tomorrow the Devil's mark
Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark
Maybe tomorrow the Devil's mark
Lightning was striking the trees all around
Abigail still in shock awoken by the sound
Run better run run better run after Little One
Run better run run after Little One
But Little One had gone gone to the beyond
Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark
I'm Brandon Henry and I serve the master here
They went in in to a room that was like a shrine
Portraits on the walls 18 in all
Long black lifeless hair
Curtains of back were inside the room
Oh Miriam why did you have to go and die
Curtains of black were inside the room
Oh Miriam why did you have to go and die
I am Count de La Fey and you are
Abigail she whispered and shivered to the bone
Can I he said Can I can I call you Miriam
Miriam or Abigail is fine
You can even call me Lucy for it is just a name
He struggled out of the wheelchair
Since his fall many years ago
Now he could only walk by a cane what a shame
Then he grabbed her head
In the pain she screamed as he
Behind glass door it said To My beloved Dear
In his twisted mind she was back but why
I must retire my dear in order to prepare
You should do the same tomorrow an heir
Mommy mommy mommy mommy
And that's a shame
Abigail was quickly on her feet
And there she was THE CHILD
Little girl tell me who you are
Sneaking out of bed like she always did
Hiding in the dark listening to the men
Tell their stories from way back then
She remembered the story of Jonathan
And they'd been talking about the Little One
And that's a shame
Abigail she knew she had to stay
Wake up Abigail midday Henry was at her door
What about Little One
Henry froze Oh you mean our ghost
Downstairs on the lowest floor
That's where you will find THE DOOR
Beyond which there ware slippery stairs
Leading down to the crypt
And Little One sleeps there during the day
But at night she'll rise searching for her Mom
Jonathan's headache it was gone
Time is right to produce an heir
Up to a room where love they would share
Jonathan was a hideous sight
So Abigail she hilled the candlelight
What was to come should have never been done
She was blocking her mind from his awful thing
In her mind his moaning became
Nothing but falling on slippery stairs
Falling and crying crawling and dying
At the end of the stairs
Her eyes turned black in disgust
Hating him more with every thrust
And then it was over before it begun
He was done oh what a man
The only time he would call her MINE
The moon is outside but it can't get in
Almost dead from his nightly sin
Abigail is in the crypt a lantern in her hand
The secret of the crypt
Oh Abigail and off comes the lid
The smell is sick
Mummified infront on its side
A name was cut deep in the lid with a knife
And it said Abigail
A silvery necklace was round the mummy's neck
It had wings and was sharpened round the edge
What are you doing here Henry had come in unseen
Was separated clean from it's tiny neck
Then up up up up into his throat
Twisting and turning it oh she couldn't stop
Brandon Henry was going down in a pool of blood
He was on the ground
There's an eerie glow in the crypt down below
Mummified infant on its side
Abigail's twin is searching for her Mom
But Mommy's in the floor and it's made of stone
Her mommy's in the floor and she doesn't know
Oh she doesn't know she doesn't know
Will she ever know
Someone was calling Henry's name
Or was it only in her dream
Rain turning red blood running for the dead
Jonathan was fighting his way out of bed
 Where is Brandon Henry and why is he late
 He didn't feel very well today
So I sent him back to bed and there he'll stay
But I my dear will cater to your needs
For you I will be the hand the hand that feeds
Abigail obsessed with her revenge
Her old spirit was back
It made her remember her dream of broken glass
Use it in your scheme the broken glass
Broken glass crushed into sugar glace
Dinner was enjoyed by candlelight
And Jonathan was wearing his
Funeral suit it put him in the right mood
Whatever it took he would do
He was in love he was in love again
He was in love he was in love again
But Abigail would soon feed his love away
Feed his love away
Dinner is served
In the dark she was so beautiful and white
Abigail was glowing like a diamond in the night
 I love you Miriam
Oh my God my stomach
 That hurts there it is again oh what pain
It's like someone's cutting me with a knife
This is more than pain
 Ah ha ha I put broken glass in your dinner dear
It's only getting worse from here
Time has come to say hello to fear
Run away with life itself
 What's wrong with you Miriam
I'm hurting please help me
 Ah ha ha NO NO you're gonna die
Run away with life itself
 I can't believe you're doing this to me
My God I'm bleeding through my mouth
What was that Oh No
Miriam she died alright but I'm still alive
The father you never knew who saved me years ago
And now I'm looking at his son
A man and his wheelchair living in the past
No room for life only the dark
But little Abigail is back again
A past so dark there is no room for life itself
And all I see when I'm looking at you
Is where EVIL always LIVED and ruled
You almost killed me and now you must pay
A man and his wheelchair living in the past
No room for life only the dark
Do you even know who the Hell it is
You are keeping in the crypt Do you
Overwhelmed him
 That child is part of ME
But without his cane Oh he didn't stand a chance
Push him in the chest she was ready for attack
One last one hit him in the neck
 I can't believe you're still alive
My God she screamed I'll teach you how to die
This should light up your worthless little life
Open up your eyes
Then she lit the torch
And this was not a dream
Abigail was out of control
She was laughing at his every scream
Abigail was feeling like the ruler of Hell
The joy of causing pain
The wheelchair was really on fire
Falling down
Jonathan is dead
And Abigail is watching his wheelchair burn
The flames lick the wooden floor
Higher and higher they go
I am the fire I'm eating everything
Spirits flying through the air
Spirits crossing over to the other side
To rest in peace and never die again
And to be with long gone friends
The ghosts of those who lived here in the past
Abigail is watching the spirits and the flames
Dancing hand in hand around her long black dress
Oh around and around they go until they touch
Abigail is on fire
Spirits flying through the air
Spirits crossing over to the other side
To rest in peace and never die again
And to be with long gone friends
Slowly she's leaving her body behind
And the spirits are right by her side
Oh no here she goes her spirit is in the air
Spirits flying through the air
Spirits crossing over to the other side
To rest in peace and never die again
And to be with long gone friends
But Abigail forgot one thing
Her own little twin
From black to no return
The night began to cry rain from the sky
As the mansion died
Oh no it died oh no it died
Deep down below fire would not go
I wonder what is wrong
As if it had a grave of it's own
I think I'm stepping in blood
Too dark for me to see a dark you only feel
Dark that always must be
Deep down below fire would not go
Not too far away I see a light
And there is Little One standing by the wall
Oh
Oh but Abigail was way too busy with revenge
And now you're stuck in here on your own
A lonely soul who'll never ever find a home
Oh No
The Countess The Countess The Countess
Mommy Mommy
Oh she cannot find her mommy
Mommy Mommy
Cause she's buried in the floor
But it's NOT your mommy you're looking for
IT'S YOURSELF
I wanna go home it's so cold down here
I don't like the dark
Where are you Mommy
Mommiiii
Will I ever see you again
Please come back and take me away from here
Sorry DearHere we go
You can take me back to the place
where I could watch the sky
and see those signs
You can show me their lies
show me the disbelief in their words
Oh these burning times
And now I can choose my fate
You can take me back to the time
where I could stand so proud
with my mind open wide
You can wash away all those lies
the burning rain which blinds my eyes
curses my way
And now I can choose my fate
You can take me back to the dimension
to the state of mind
where I could be myself again
You can clear my mind
you can clear my thoughts
You can take away
all these fears from my soul
And now I can choose my fate
I will listen to the call call of the eternity
Soon they will see what I mean
When I've said that stones won't bleed
So that they don't have to waste
their lives wondering why
They've been dreaming all these years
All these years I've been hurting
It is my answer to their world
to everything I see
Have you ever seen
the weight of the world
crushing someone's soul
You will see me in hell cos
I have opened myself
for this god of emptiness
I have painted it in my flesh
So that the whole world can see
There is something very cold in me
they don't want to believe
I've said stay away from me
from my sick morality
My life goes on without your love
without your prayers now
Have you ever seen
the weight of the world
crushing someone's soul
You will see me in hell cos
I have opened myself
for this god of emptiness
Read my scars
Read my scars it's okay for me baby
Read my scars
Read my scars it's okay for me baby
Have you ever seen
the weight of the world
crushing someone's soul
You will see me in hell cos
I have opened myself
for this god of emptiness
Read my scars
Read my scars it's okay for me baby
Read my scars
Read my scars
Welcome
Welcome to my world of hate
damnation of my soul
Here we could be together
with my dreams of death you know
Tell me what you feel
My queen of entity
Welcome
Welcome to this bitter
state of my mind
I'm a dying dream
This is my imitation of life
Replica of sanity yeah
Tell me what you feel
My queen of entity
This isn't love
it's something else
Still you can't see
why my heart belongs to you
with all it's secrecies
But I hold the key just one more time
and I open myself for you
But I hold the key just one more time
I would love to kill myself for you
Tell me what you feel
My queen of entity
This isn't love
it's something else
Still you can't see
why my heart belongs to you
with all it's secrecies
But I hold the key just one more time
and I open myself for you
But I hold the key just one more time
I can remember the times
When the grace was
shining on my face
Don't you see don't you feel
those days are gone
They've vanished in the air
Now I could not care less
of you and your poisoned mind
cos I have already seen
this thousand times
My emotions are hidden
in a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
that we once shared
on these frontlines
frontlines of mysteries
Oh hell yeah
I can remember the love
At some point it became
one with my hate
I can see how
you are wasting your life
wasting your dignity
The light in my eyes is fading away
But I bleed no tears
cos I know your destiny
My emotions are hidden
in a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
that we once shared
on these frontlines
frontlines of mysteries
How blind can you be
Don't you know what I mean
Love divided love divided
Extending agony
Love divided love divided
I hate your empty words
and the grin on your face ah
My emotions are hidden
in a place where you can't see
Hate is replacing the dreams
that we once shared
on these frontlines
frontlines of mysteries
How blind can you be
Don't you know what I mean
Love divided love divided
Extending agony
Love divided love divided
I hate your empty words
I am noone
I am noone to judge you
who cannot read between their lies
Oh I can't blame you
They're hiding into the shadows
of those words
Guiding you into the sea of lies
Never telling you
who is god of all this misery
I am noone
I am noone to take the
pain away from your soul
Wake up and open your eyes
They're hiding into the shadows
of those words
Guiding you into the sea of lies
Never telling you
who is god of all this misery
Wake up
Faceless
You will hate yourself
Faceless
In the end of the line you will see
I am noone
I am noone to save you
But I still can't understand why
they have done this to you
They're hiding into the shadows
of those words
Guiding you into the sea of lies
Never telling you
who is god of all this misery
They're hiding into the shadows
of those words
Guiding you into the sea of lies
Never telling you
who is god of all this misery
Faceless
Voi perkele
The time has come for you and me
To reveal the truth from inside
I am not of the kind you want me to be
I'm going nowhere but down
Forgive me father for my sins
Forgive me for the things I have done
Hey just look at me I know the reason
You just can't see it from that far
When you look into my eyes
You see a dead part of your life
We are still together as one
In your world build on silence and greed
Forgive me father for my sins
Forgive me for the things I have done
Hey just look at me I know the reason
You just can't see it from that far
I will go on my way from the cradle to the grave
I am the one who you should not blame
Take care of your soul I'll take care of my own
Cos you make me a preacher as you know
Forgive me father for my sins
Forgive me for the things I have done
Hey just look at me I know the reason
You just can't see it from that far
I will go on my way from the cradle to the grave
I am the one who you should not blame
Take care of your soul I'll take care of my own
Cos you make me a preacher
Cos you make me a preacher as you know
Flesh is all that you want
it's all that you see in this
crushing game of yours
Life itself never satisfies
you in your twisted act in
this theatre of power
Perfection in pleasures
fatal flash of joy
And noone will ever cross
this infernal love
Can't you see what you're doing
to those who believe in you
and your psychotic eyes
Smile on your face insanity
They belong to your circle of misery
Perfection in pleasures
fatal flash of joy
And noone will ever cross
this infernal love
All hail hail the flesh
You never care of anything else
All hail hail the flesh
You never care of anything else
Just sacrifice everyone
in the name of your god
but remember that your time will come
Sick addiction and years tradition
Pride has been taken away from your soul
Perfection in pleasures
fatal flash of joy
And noone will ever cross
this infernal love
All hail hail the flesh
You never care of anything else
I hate myself and my way of life
This time it makes me bleed from inside
Cos I was too weak to stand by your side
and now it's too late for me to say goodbye
Crying into the night
that's the only thing that I can do
Cos now those wings of darkness are holding
I blame myself and this choice of mine
Sometimes I just can't make things right
When I turn around and look into your eyes
I know that dreams they will die
Crying into the night
that's the only thing that I can do
Cos now those wings of darkness are holding you
Black swan of death
The game has come to the end
Black swan of death
The game has come to the end
to the end
Crying into the night
that's the only thing that I can do
Cos now those wings of darkness are holding you
Black swan of death
The game has come to the end
Black swan of death
The game has come to the end
They stare at you with hollow eyes
Still you can't figure out what they really want
Clearest greed has closed their lips
They'll take you in they'll spit you out
Down on your knees you have to face their crowd
without dreams your world can't remain in sight
You're trapped in their world world of disguise
Your corrupted soul won't be reborn
Judgement is now in the hands of the most inept
Shape shifters
they don't care what you feel
they don't care if you bleed
you've sold your soul for those
who don't give a shit
Shape shifters
they don't care what you feel
they don't care if you bleed
you've sold your soul for those
who don't give a shit
Your soul is like an empty shell
Prayers to god will not change a thing
The truth is always the first victim of war
And that is what they are waiting for
Your corrupted soul won't be reborn
Judgement is now in the hands of the most inept
Shape shifters
they don't care what you feel
they don't care if you bleed
you've sold your soul for those
who don't give a shit
Shape shifters
they don't care what you feel
they don't care if you bleed
you've sold your soul for those
who don't give a shit
What kind of a man is a man
who lives in the kingdom of tyrants
What kind of a man is a man
who calls you with the voice of sirens
That man hates everything
in you and your existence
That man takes everything
from you and gives you nothingness
Still you keep crawling before his eyes
Still you refuse to
refuse to reach into the light
and the pattern keeps repeating itself
What kind of a man is a man
who can blame someone else for his sins
What kind of a man is a man
whose image becomes clear
when darkness descends
That man does not have a name
some call him Master
That man does not give you choice
Still you feel some kind of attraction
Still you keep crawling before his eyes
Still you refuse to
refuse to reach into the light
and the pattern keeps repeating itself
God of reptiles
God of reptiles
Beware
God of reptiles
God of reptiles
You will betray yourself you will
You will hate yourself you will
You will lose yourself you will
You will see your finger on the trigger
You will see you will feel
That your world is in flames
And everything you've got is emptiness
You will see you will feel
That this is not a game
And your god is merciless
Still you keep crawling before his eyes
Still you refuse to
refuse to reach into the light
and the pattern keeps repeating itself
God of reptiles
God of reptiles
Beware
God money just tell me what you want me to
God money nail me up against the wall
God money don't want everything he wants it all
No you can't take it
No you can't take it
No you can't take that away from me
No you can't take it
No you can't take it
No you can't take that away from me
Head like a hole
Black as your soul
I'd rather die than give you control
Head like a hole
Black as your soul
I'd rather die than give you control
Bow down before the one you serve
You're going to get what you deserve
Bow down before the one you serve
You're going to get what you deserve
God money's not looking for the cure
God money's not one to choose
You know who you are
Hey God why are you doing this to me
Am I not living up to what I'm supposed to be
Why am I seething with this animosity
Hey God I think you owe me a great big apology
Terrible Lie 
Hey God I really don't know what you mean
Seems like salvation comes only in our dreams
I feel my hatred grow all the more extreme
Don't take it don't take it don't
Hey God There's nothing left for me to hide
I lost my ignorance security and pride
I'm all alone in a world you must despise
You make me throw it all away
My morals left to decay
How many you betray
You've taken everything
My head is filled with disease
My skin is begging you please
I'm on my hands and knees
I want so much to believe
Down
I was up about it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
I was up above it
I was up above it
Now I'm down in it
Out I guess the jokes on me she said
I used to be so big and strong
I used to know my right from wrong
I used to never be afraid
I used to be somebody
I used to have something inside
Now just this hole that's open wide
I used to want it all
I used to be somebody
Used to think was me is just a fading memory
I looked him right in the eye and said goodbye
What if I found a way to wash it all inside
What if she touches with those fingertips
As the words spill out like fire from her lips
If she says come inside I'll come inside for her
I am justified
I am purified
I am sancitifed inside you
Heaven's just a rumor she dispells
As she walks me through the nicest parts of Hell
I still dream of lips I never should have kissed
Well she knows exactly what I can't resist
I'm just caught up in another of her spells
While she's turning me into someone else
Every day I hope and pray that this will end
But when I can I'd do it all again
I still recall the taste of your tears
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
You always were the one to show me how
This thing is slowly taking me apart
Grey would be the color if I had a heart
Come on and tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
In this place it seems like such a shame
Though it all looks different now
I know it's still the same
Everywhere I look you're all I see
Come on and tell me
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing
And I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have
I can't shake this feeling from my head
There's a devil sleeping in my bed
He's watching you from across the way
I cannot make this feeling go away
I know it's not the right thing
And I know it's not the good thing
Kinda I want to
I'm not sure of what I should do
When everything I'm think of is you
All of my excuses turn to lies
Maybe God will cover up his eyes
Kind I want to
Maybe just for tonight
We can pretend it's alright
What's the price I pay
I don't care what they say
I want to
You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my Purity
My Purity you stole
Am I just too stupid to realize
Stale incense old sweat and lies lies lies
It comes down to this
Your kiss
Your fist
And your strain
It get's under my skin
Within
Take in the extent of my sin
You give me the anger
You give me the nerve
Carry out my sentence
Well I get what I deserve
I'm just an effigy to be disgraced
To be defaced
Well your need for me has been replaced
You give me the reason
You give me control
I gave you my Purity
My Purity you stole
Am I just too stupid to realize
Stale incense old sweat and lies lies lies
Just when everything was making sense
You took away all my selfconfidence
Now all that I've been hearing must be true
I guess I'm not the only boy for you
But that's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
That's what I get
How could you turn me into this
After you just taught me how to kiss you
I told you I'd never say goodbye
Now I'm slipping on the tears you made me cry
Why does it come as a surprise
To think that I was so naive
Maybe didn't mean that much
But it meant everything to me
I'm drunk
Right now I'm so in love with you
Nothing quite like the feel of something new
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
This is the only time I really feel alive
I swear I just found everything I need
My moral standing is lying down
Nothing quite like the feel of something new
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
Maybe I'm all messed up
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
Maybe I'm all messed up in you
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
This is the only time I really feel alive
Well you've got me working so hard lately
Working my hands until they bleed
If I was twice the man I could be
I'd still be half of what you need
Still you lead me and I follow
Anything you ask you know I'll do
Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Sever flesh and bone
And offer it to me
Well you just left me nailed here
Hanging like Jesus on his cross
I'm just dying for your sins
And aiding to the cause
Wrap my eyes in bandages
Confessions I see through
I get everything I want
When I get part of you
Ringfinger
Promise carved in stone
Deeper than the sea
Ringfinger
Devil's flesh and bone
Do something for me
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
You don't know I'm there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Electric eye in the sky
Feel my stare always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Protected Detective Electric eye
We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath
Never straight and narrow
I won't keep in time
Tend to bend the arrow out of line
Been inclined to wander
Off the beaten track
Grinder  looking for the meat
Grinder  wants you to eat
Got no use for routine
I shiver at the thought
Open skies on my scene this boy won't get caught
Refuse to bait the man trap
Be left to set the snare
I love to have my sight capped everywhere
Grinder  looking for meat
Grinder  wants you to eat
I have my licence
It came with birth
For self reliance of this earth
You take the bullet
On which my name
Was etched to file me in your game
Day of independence
Stamped us like a brand
On the necks of millions to the land
As the mighty eagle
I need room to breath
Witness from the treadmill
I take my leave
Grinder  looking for meat
Grinder  wants you to eat
Grinder  looking for meat
Grinder  wants you to eat
Pounding the world
Like a battering ram
Forging the furnace
For the final grand slam
Chopping away at the source
Soon the course will be done
Leaving a trail of destruction
That's second to none
Hammering anvils
Screaming muscle and might
Shattering blows
Crashing row beating fright
Fast devastating and
Desolisating the curse
Blasting the cannons of
Truth through each man
Of this earth
Wielding the axe
Comes the one culmination
That's always seemed
Certain to bring down the curtain on greed
Sifting the good from the bad
It's the age for the rage of the
Dogs which must fall to the just
And be free
Now grate for the vandals
Who trampled and sampled
Till this place conditioned
Brought forth demolition to war
The slipping and sliding
Corrosive subsiding
That withered and waned
Till the world seemed all drained
Fills the bay
Pounding the world
Like a battering ram
Forging the furnace
For the final grand slam
Leaving a trail of destruction
That's second to none
Second to none
Atrocities
Made every day
Religiously
Their sins
They hide
Can never disguise
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies
They wage their wars
Such profiteers
Will nail us all
Their crimes
Concealed
Despicably reveal
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained lies
They fire at will
Intent to kill
They have no conscience
They have no conscience
Ethnic cleansing nothing more
Blood of nations blood of war
Turn blind eyes
From all your crimes
You bare our souls
Show no remorse
You cannot wash
The bloodstains off
They turn their backs
While others
Commit grisly acts
We're scared
For life
By politicians' greedy
Blood stained hands
Blood stained times
Blood stained weapons
Blood stained crimes
Blood stained lands
Blood stained minds
Blood stained deeds
Blood stained lies
And while such predators
Stalk this earth
Disguised as saints
They kill our faith
Obsessed by greed
Lying through their teeth
They cannot wash
The blood stains off
Along deserted avenues
Steam begins to rise
The figures primed and ready
Prepared for quick surprise
He's watchin' for a sign
His life is on the line
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the Sentinel
Dogs whine in the alleys
Smoke is on the wind
From deep inside its empty shell
A cathedral bell begins
Sending out its toll
A storm begins to grow
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the Sentinel
Amidst the upturned burnedout cars
The challengers await
And in their fists clutch iron bars
With which to seal his fate
Across his chest is scabbards rest
The rows of throwing knives
Whose razor points in challenged tests
Have finished many lives
Now facing one another
The standoff eats at time
Then all at once a silence falls
As the bell ceases its chime
Upon this sign the challengers
With shrieks and cries rush forth
The knives fly out like bullets
Upon their deadly course
Screams of pain and agony
Rent the silent air
Amidst the dying bodies
Blood runs everywhere
The figure stands expressionless
Impassive and alone
Unmoved by this victory
And the seeds of death he's sown
Sworn to avenge
Condemn to hell
Tempt not the blade
All fear the Sentinel
You mesmerize slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
You're possessing me
Speak to me
Of those days I won't forget
Your worst dreams
Has just returned  to pay you back
I'm still laughing
There's not much else I can do
But one's thing's certain
I'm coming back for you
Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who you used it on
You're going to burn in Hell
Die
Why
Time to pay the price
Kill
I will
Have my sacrifice
Plead
With fear
I am getting near
Friend
Liar
Time to eat some fire
Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in Hell
Burn in Hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in Hell
You are going to blister
Have you got a gun
Do you remember well
Who d'ya use it on
You're going to burn in Hell
Burn in Hell
Burn in Hell
Snarl like a dog
You'll scream like a banshee
Stuck like a hog
You're gonna love me
Burn in Hell
I can hear you whisper
Burn in Hell
You are going to blister
Burn in Hell
Screaming like a banshee
Burn in Hell
Burn
You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In London town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack
I smile when I'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when I'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper
You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if I'm near
I'm sly and I'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for The Ripper
Or if you like Jack The Knife
Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream of the fright
All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripperthe ripperthe ripper
Sunrise showing every flaw
Paying for the night before
Dark eyes scanning every vein
Exploding  cannot stand the strain
With each new mile     They death defy me
Standing on trial     Scrutinize me
And questionize my
Strong denial
Bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Windows illuminating stains
Breakdown closing in again
Freefall as I close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Changing my course     Blurred and scorched
Breathing exhaust     As we distort
By gravity
Of such Gforce
Bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Breakdown close my eyes
Voices talking many lies
Stained glass bursting in
Shattering my world again
Freefall but never can
Ever reach the ground again
Dark eyes scanning in
Feel my mind explode within
Wanting much more     I implore you
Near to death's door     To ignore
The screams of all
Who fall before
Bullet bullet train
Piercing through my brain
Bullet
He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand
Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you
Withdrawn he'd sit there
Stare blank into space
No sign of life
Would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled
It seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him
Goodbye  and then he died
Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for livin' in
Yeah I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever
And ever but I'll still win
How many like him
Are there still
But to us all
Seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands
Plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost
Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
It's not fit for livin' in
Beyond the realms of death
Dead man walking
We've all been detained
For the crimes we've committed
They stayed execution
But we'll never get acquitted
Waiting for the day when they strap us in
And when they pull the lever
Hear the goddamn screams
Shake with fear
Electric chair
We're all inside
Homocide related
They'll show no mercy
And we don't anticipate it
We move a little closer
Every day to meet our maker
They cover up our face
And then they close the circuit breaker
Oh No
Shake with fear
Your time draws near
Oh No  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Oh come on man
Give me a break
I made one mistake that's all it takes
Shake with fear
The end is near
Oh No  I won't go
You'll never get me down to Death row
Oh No  They're taking me slow
One way ticket to Death row
So what's the matter son
Too young to die
Take it like a man
Don't cry Ah Ah
Ahh
Oh No  I won't go
You'll never get me down to
Death row
Say a prayer best beware
It's not very nice in the electric chair
Oh No  I won't go
You'll never get me down
To Death row
Oh No  They're taking me
Slow
A one way ticket to
Death row
Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight
Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
Noone survives
Raging fury
Wired for sound
Nitro bombshell
Shakes the ground
High and mighty
Rips the air
Piercing lazer
Burning glaze
Out of control
About to explode
It's coming at ya
Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
Noone survives
Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light
Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud
It's comin'  Meltdown
Start runnin'  Countdown
Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
'Come to me' it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
While it feasts on flesh and blood
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking its victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Abductors  they come at night
They come at night and they infiltrate you
They paralyse and they mentally rape you
Expressionless they disintegrate you
The probe your soul and desecrate you
Abductors  will bleed your mind
Abductors  cutting inside
They come for you in the night
They strap you instruments laid before you
And powerless begin to explore you
You scream in pain but they just ignore you
The bring machines and they drill and bore you
Abductors  cutting inside
Abductors  drinking your mind
Noone believes that you
Were chosen from few
Defiled and abused
By alien rituals
You wake in fright there in your room
You better hope your memory fails you
A lower form of life to them
Just one more blood experiment
Abductors  will bleed your mind
Abductors  cutting inside
They come for you in the night
They send you back and disorientate you
A lesser race they discriminate you
Whatever said will incriminate you
Noone believes
The sceptics laugh and annihilate you
They dig you out and they excavate you
Authority and even God forsakes you
Noone believes
Hey maybe I am just a liar
Don't you know you're driving me insane
You're tryin' to find your way through life
You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman got her man
She won't find no new connection
You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to find some new
Another woman's got her man
But she won't find a new
You 'bin foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up get out you know you really blew it
Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mineshe was mine
Changes changes changes changes
Victim of changes
I'll be damned here comes your ghost again
But that's not unusual
It's just that the moon is full
And you decided to call
And here I sit hand on the telephone
Hearing the voice I'd known
A couple of light years ago
Headed straight for a fall
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
But we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
Yes we both know what memories can bring
They bring Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds Diamonds and Rust
Diamonds Diamonds and Rust
feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
Breaking the law breaking the law

So much for the golden future I can't even start
Breaking the law breaking the law

Can't believe that she needs my love so bad
Come sneaking around trying to drive me mad
Just taking my love and slip away
Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight I said I'll never get enough
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You got another thing comin'
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
Act tough ain't room for second best

You've got another thing comin'
Seek him here seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams From a streak of fire as he strikes
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Black as night faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition of sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams Crash one by one to the ground
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one AM loaded loaded
I'm all geared up to score again loaded loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
Ready to take on every deal loaded loaded
My pulse is racing I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up fit to break
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric sparkin' power loaded loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour loaded loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Now that we are all here at the same time 
A B C D
This is a death race 
We're not trying to reinvent the wheel
It's picking up speed
As we step on the pedal the sky is falling
We've heard this before 
Babylon is falling
Oh come on we've heard that one before
So we better start listening
Negative space  Man what a concept 
Is this still life 
Now that sounds romantic  oh how romantic 
Oh how brillant How sad How fucking lonely 
You are your only friend 
You are your own worst enemy
No one is going to hurt you 
You do that better yourself 
No one is going to desert you 
You do that yourself 
You are the best so better yourself
It's the end
Of our beginning
I've forgotten
Who you really are
I've forgotten
Who I really am
I haven't got time
For what you feel
No I haven't got time
For what you feel
And you do it again
How do I find her
When there's nothing left
And you do it again
I've spent a lifetime
of covering up
Now the buildings go
Trees and stone are eternal 
Empires come and go 
Now we have a better view of the mountains 
They are so much more majestic 
Than the kingdome 
What the fuck were we thinking
All the sages 
Who were locked up in cages 
Have come to reclaim this throne 
Let these animals roam 
Marching into battle singing 
Ohm na ma shivaya Ganesha Ganesha 
New lights needs room to run freely 
To make way for a change
Red eyes break the silence of night skies 
Our alarm clocks make the sun rise 
Espresso controls the tides 
All circuits busy Another digit Here in the 
The decomposing masters of Kungfu rock and roll 
All these luxuries are very 
Tangled up in a big scary 
Web of systems 
Are we ready for what happens 
When all the systems fail 
Were the Right Bros 
Fucking high On some kind of LSD  
When they got up in the air 
What did they see 
Everybody here on the ground 
Doing the Y2K countdown 
Left wing Right wing 99 you better duck
Young dumb fools Here we come 
Dragging what`s left of our dirty thoughts 
We`re feeling young and dumb 
Because they come Out of nowehre 
And without a warning Good morning 
Slide out of bed 
We`ve been slinging 
Hey everyone gets lonely 
Even when we`re not alone 
It can be very scary 
Wearing these earth suits 
It`s no fault of ours 
That we`re all unclean 
She`s unclean He`s unclean 
Just like our mothers and our fathers 
And their mothers and their fathers 
And their mothers and their fathers 
They all died and Have solied themselves 
And it leeches up through the roots 
To the flowers 
Where the birds abd the bees pollinate 
The land with toxic shame 
Shame begets shame Guilt and shame 
Toxic shame End this strain
Undertones of horror Are in the ring of freedom 
With a hand to feed them don`t ignore the power 
Of ignorance All the names were changed 
Uniforms exchanged Still dressed to kill 
Because the intent is still the same 
And has been all this while 
Lying under a pile Of lye coated children 
All wearing big smiles They`ve been stripmauled 
And hauled From their o`hallowed halls 
All classes dismissed Any risk of infection 
Now we all learn From our imperfections 
Now we all burn in our own hell 
`NO` Please don`t let it go to Our children 
But they only heard the word `NO` 
When they needed your undivided attention 
Why are you so fucking stupid Y
ou can`t wash your hands to kill infection
Let the schools burn 
And end this quarentine 
All you parents and teachers 
You`re fired
Daunting colossus eve 
The door opens expiration 
Hand fed cyclical rotation 
Package pretty invitation 
Appease the retched spiral nation 
Glass reflecting 
Image pending What does this mean 
Hallowed be they name 
Spell this out for the lights 
Blinding me the same thing you love Kills you 
Now we are all one 
One in the same Hole we fell
For the home coming 
Now we look at ourselves 
Look at our ways 
Look at our waste 
And count down the days 
Left to die in our shells 
We`re gutted and cleaned 
Our hair is just perfect DNA in our cells 
The blood in our veins is real Inhumane 
Slaves to ourselves 
The image we made Of God 
We gave it all power 
To make us repent 
On our knees 
All bets and all theories are off 
No repreive 
No double 
No nothing 
Nothing left 
And nothing less
Then all we`ve been 
Stripped for all we`re worth
Gambled on a pale horse 
And we lost 
Our image of God is a dead one 
This can`t be happening 
Right now the date is here 
We are not ready 
When the stars begin to turn red 
We`ll run and hide
`m open for your arms 
Present in your arms 
In the company of your arms 
Each mindful breath brings me closer 
Raise my heart and sing 
Gala Jai Ma Gala Jai 
Take from me all that is unclean 
Ma Ma 
I only live If I let you live
I only feel If I let you speak 
through me I`m the heavens 
you want to touch me I
`m the fire in your bellies 
I am earth you want to dig me 
I`m your water you need me 
I am flesh you don`t need me 
but you sink your teeth into me 
I am earth if you dig me 
You can`t stand your feet without me 
I`m the heavens no one can see me 
I am fire you abused me
I`m the earth you`ve scarred for money 
I`m your mother 
I made love for you and you just fucked me 
Mother fucker 
My love my blood is clean burning fuel 
My skin will tremble at your touch 
I will erupt for you I will get you off me 
When I skin myself alive 
I will survive
Oh great spirit 
Of resistance 
Help us through this 
Time of turbulent 
Wind coniditions 
Keep our vision pure 
Protect is from this cold hard surface 
And this violent squall 
So we can all find our way 
Back to where we started our family 
Please keep our aggressors at bay 
And our allies near 
The generations before us 
Have had their own distrust 
In the face of fear 
They felt cold 
Just like we do 
So what 
So what do we doThrough a forgotten realm
an endless path of sorrow
A season of darkness
among the shadows
I walk alone
in desperation I am bleeding
the cold winter of my soul
Painted
towards
the dying
sun
this land
of eternal
desolation
abandoned by ancient wisdoms
once a glorious
entity
now embraced
by silence
I feel
so
cold
My hope is fading away
emptiness covering
my body
Here I lay gazing the weeping moon
in the darkest skies
so alone
alone
If only I could
feel her embrace
before I enter
the world
beyond
sinking into eternal
sleep
oh my bleeding
soul
Sinking
into
the
obscure
away
from a
tragic
existance
hear my
cry
as I
die
My
dismal soul
eternally bleeding
as I witness
the falling mankind
I cry for their sins
eternal tears
this hateful existance
our final
doom
With tearfilled eyes
I stare towards the sky
my spirit free
flies into obscurity
obscurity
body degenerating
ora feeding my soul
truth revealed
at last
I
am
born
with the soaring eagle leaving my past behind
the point of no
return
it wants me back
spellbound by it's magic I start to fall
the soaring eagle imprisoned in pain
empty soul struggling
again
Destiny awaits
the evil whispering voice
it decays as it witnesses the revival of my soul
of
of my soul
the
point
of no
return
They have walked amidst the stars
they have walked upon the earth
they linger and ever await
the time of their rebirth
oh masters of all unseen
arise and set us free
you were and you are
and forever you shall be
Rejected like the falling angel
cast out from this life
I am a victim of my desires
a monument of my pain
an empty shell devoid of  emotions
in ivory black I am painted dead
Enthralled by beuty
yearning for bliss
oh I sacrificed myself
to fulfill my dreams
I saw sun
and I felt it's warmth
and I reached out my hand
to love and life
embraced by melancholic euphony
I knew
I was at the mercy of the parasites
like fallen fruit
to be drained from life
And I cried
In the midst
of my
ebony meadows
I was dancing with the dead
I was lost
in a strain of silence
I was one with emptiness
At the shore of the black sea
where the birds are silent
I cursed her name
I saw the death of the sun
I tasted the tears
of heaven
and I saw it all
pass by
Bleeding dry
loosing hope
I used to love
I used to care
now deprived from all that matters to me
my words mean nothing
my emotions are dead
my dreams are empty
if she only knew
oh I wish she knew
I close my eyes and I sigh
And so it ends
and so we die
wither away
like autumn leaves
a slow decent
into oblivion
where we shall dwell
forever
And I'm planning our escape
To the places we can go
To the shores that we call home
Well surly we can make it out of here
You know that we will never be clear
Of the feelings they all harbor
Well yea I'd rather not bother
Do you feel lonely
All the time
If you'll come with me well then I can show you
That the lives we lead could be sure and true
There's nothing wrong with me
There's nothings wrong with you
There's nothing wrong with us I'm seeing through
I've folded in my heart I'd waste it all for you
Do you feel lonely
All the time
Be silent
Try breathing
I have a lot to lose more than I can tell you
Oh god I'm almost there
I'm already leaving
Keep silent and breath in
In breathing we are no longer here
Lies
I am alive I feel alive
Are you listening
There could be more than this
I'm never coming back
We've made our choice
Now let's live with it
In my life I never had the chance to change
Why can't we change
Grown enough to know where to begin
If we know where it would end
Then we all could see the sky for what it is
We are lost
Like running in circles
Trying to realize what we are
We are the truth
We hold the proof that what we are is of no use
Is there a way to make a change
While running in circles
Can we outlive the coming days
No
We are a waste of space
We are the world gone wrong
Save yourself
I am awake
Behold the treason
That sits fittingly on crowns of war
We're sifting soot gathering the evidence
While they let us believe
That the accused is free
Well if I'm dreaming
Please let this be the one that wakes me
From this life
No longer will I allow myself
To sink this way
I will  curse you as you sit on high
And watch us burn
They'd watch us die
I wish that it were not true
The ways we choose to love
Can lead us down
And show us how to be ourselves
There is no us in this world anymore
There is only war
Believing in a change
Is what has sent them away
To cause more pain
To breed more war
I feel so alone
Like there is no home
And this wind feels like fire in my bones
Someone set me free
Allow me to be all you ever wanted
I'm all you'll ever need
Hey there you are a simple design
I created your lies
Hold on this is not fair for anyone
They all think they are alive
This is my immaculate design
It's all been planned from the start
Your slipping deeper and deeper
Destroying all you held
Your words are losing their meaning
You choose to receive death
I grow increasingly weary
And I'm tired of this jest
Dear god what made us all deserve this
There must be some other way
My son it's far too much to handle
Just know I do this in love
You see you are a disposable being
Don't fearlife is fake
We all exist in the same space
Never again will we feed those with inhibition
And let me catch anyone trying to think free
Keep a close eye on those sleeping
I will renounce the moment you were given power
The darkness you see was not caused by me
well it has always existed here
Just spread my ashes in the wind
Take her out
You see what becomes of thieves here
Keep listening as I speak
There will be one true reckoning
We're gathering as we prevail
So I will sail before we fail
As the world keeps spinning around
We're trying to grab a piece of ground
We are only breathing
Look to the children who have no home
Look to the children what have they done
What are we waiting for
Never again will we see the worlds dreams
They're all dying
We are the visitors here and the air is failing
There is no world to punish we destroyed it all
The moral majority knows
Nothing of what it is to be free
Now if we examine the modern ways of thinking
Then perhaps we could see
The mistakes we are making
The standard way of life
Is not better now than it used to be
Is the answer too great
For the question at hand
Can we allow ourselves to advance
So it seems to me
That there will be an eternity
That will carry us home in the end
Just hold onto me hang on
It will be alright in the end
They need us here
For our love and for our fear
They force love
They force fear
I need release
I pose a simple question
Are we allowed to exist with fear
There seems to be a new consensus
One that guides us all through life
To hold us all here together
And allow the free to fly
Viewing the spirit from the other side
Is a guide to inner truth
Follow the spirit and allow your soul to glide
Allow me to show you truth
There's always been the same dimensions
That allow us all to try
To see ourselves in true potential
And allow the free to fly
To simply look in the mirror
Cannot show you all you need
Will you look in the mirror
And tell me what you see
I've run so long
I must escape
There is only so much that I can take
Their approval means nothing
This is something I will not give them
To fly to fall
Is knowing that I am alive
I have given up and I have given in
I have shed my wings away
Are you feeling well
I'm still waiting here lost and without a care
The further you run the closer you are to me
Well I'm still waiting here
Arms wide and wearing thin
You must be blinded by your own eyes
Surely you understand it's you I despise
And if we hold on to what we had
We could be what everyone has
Just to see the sun rise into the sky
I'd give anything to be closer to you
Corroded my substance
Leaving me happily blind
For that what ascended
Might perish again
And for that what lies sunk
Maybe rises once again
Alien encroachment from the outside
From undefined dimensions
Lost within the night
The dreadful awaits and dreams in the depths
Desolational aura the insane god's caress
An always distinct disastrous scent 
Putrefaction of centuries is omnipresent
This vortex of chaos grinds
Consciousness out of my mind
I saw the AllInOne and OneInAll
Where piscomorph perversities crawl
Where stridently whistling insanity
Praises all sickening sublimity
For that what ascended
Must perish again
And for that what lies sunk
Has to rise once again
Out of the Eons  Onto this world
Everyone listened 
And everyone was listening
As it lumbered slobbingly
Into sight and gropingly
Squeezed ist immensity
Through the black doorway
Into the tainted outside air
Of that poisoncity of madness
Nyarlathotep great messenger
Bringer of strange joy
Father of the millions 
To Yuggoth through the void
So from the wells of night 
To the gulfs of space
And from the gulfs of space
To the wells of night
Now that we've come together
Our mind's unite as one
The stars are standing right
For Cthulhu to come
Chant the ancient rhyme
That maketh the Absu gleam
Iae Hastur c'fayak
Come forth Archaic Lords
Shubb Nigghurath
Goat with a thousand young
Lord of the black woods
Arise and spread your breed
Nyarlathotep  have mercy
The lightning  no longer flashes
I can see all  that is not sight
Where light is dark  and dark is light
I've seen the dark universe yawning
Where the black planets roll without aim
Where they roll in their horror unheeded
Without knowledge or lustre or name
Nyarlathotep I call to thee
Return from the black star
That lies within the Hyades
Not far from Aldebar
Your expectations whatever they are
Blind illusions pour justice lies far
The deal is a fraud the bargain's in vain
The intention's exploring the deepest domain
Solving the puzzle means using the key
Time is eternal for the suffering you'll see
The final invitation must not be recalled
Perpetual quest for the pain's last resort
Begin the procedure your part is done
Now my turn's approaching for having the fun
The penetration of your skin
Enlightment as the steel slips in
The barbs do fasten flesh is extent
Tissue is stretchung repulsive intent
Exploring the depths
Exploring the depths
Arm yourself in patience revel in dissection
Agony's intensity beyond all expectations
Feed on the infinite depths of suffering
I live your fully life of anguishing
Enlarge emotions by the crucialst strain
Investigate the possibilities of pain
Enthusiastic feasting to enforce some ecstasy
Convulsivic remains of agony's enormity
Devote yourself to my most skillful techniques
Nameless is this ancient city
Beyond the R'lyeh gate
Blasphemies from elder stars 
That dream beneath the sea
The green spawn of the universe 
Shall awake to claim his own
Regurgitated from his tomb
Now finally free to roam
Praise the threelobed burnig eye
Ascend from below through the gates
Ever the praises of mighty Tsatthoggua
And Himwhocan'tbenamed
A kind of force
That doesn't belong
in our part of space
A twisted truth
That is all wrong
And can never be a fake
If heaven is mercyful
The sight I saw
Will some day efface
And if there is a god 
In the heavens above
Let me live my last days in peace 
 of mind
Blind Idiot God
See our cities our civilization
Sick termite disorganisation
Ant colonies divided in floors
Stocked up in sections
Like segments of worms
Domesticated primates strive
In ignorant mindless policy
Claiming evolutional enormity
For dehumanizing life
Crawling embryonic beings
Protected by weak crusts of ego
Yawn infantile obedience
Of vegetative decadence
Excessively producing cubic isolation
Eroding the need for communication
Sluglike larval citizens in embryonic phobia
Harmonized the unity of insectoid construction
Reveal biointelligence the dominance of species
Populate a dying world bare of vegetation
Creeping larval creatures
No longer individuals
The decadence within
Crawl forward to obliteration
Efface in selfimmolation
As you gain  for power 
Pain has been hurled
Opression every hour
It's a dogeatdog world
Now as you can see
Dream turns into insanity
Only the Thoughtpolice mattered
Your dreams of a free life are shattered
Total reconstruction of the past
Twominutehateprogrammes 
That won't last
No truth  but propaganda
In your head
Slowly dicovering that
WE ARE THE DEAD
Total control
By permanent supervision
Absolute power
By manipulation
No correspondence
Between facts and their representation
WAR IS PEACE
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
IGNORANCE IS STRENGHT
Catching cold infiltrating nasal cavities
Eroding malfunctioning
Secrete production multiplied
Swollen flesh respiration prohibited
The putrid caves deteriorate
Aural system in a deafened state
Infectious mass of virulence
Festering slime increases my hate
SALVATION
Penetrating sterile metal tubes
Proceeding to the core of pus
Ultrasonic waves detect the nucleus
Now injecting solvatating aerosols
VACUUM ON
Eyes gouge in pus sucked out
In my skull behind my face
Pressurize  DEHUMANIZED
Passing through membranes that divide the brain
Meningitis  consequence damage of cerebral flesh
In chronical development no use in sucking out
Now feel the chisel in your head's front
Free me Oh please release me
Kill me Oh won't you kill me
I I can't defy
Cry in eternal lie to let me die 
Hack into the rotten holes
Recognize a spoon is carving mucus
Abrasing infiltrating
Secretial biopsy  HATE
Economy prevailing morality
The principle on which we are all lived
More inventions to accumulate prosperity
To feed the greed of industry
The crushing wheels of society
Greased with our bloody sweat
Spill forth some new deformity
Mindlessly blind outrageously mad
What extent of degeneration 
Can be achieved by exploitation
My generation rots at consciousness
Just mere sad crawling putrescence
Not more than raging human scum
A waste of spermial fluidum
Desoyribonucleicacid rape
A twisted mass a morbid shape
Evolved mutations
Warped by your inheritance
Walking perversions
See us suffer without sense
A passion for dying
A craving for death
Tomorrow is worthless
We are already deadIntruder  Alert
Intruder  Alert
Intruder  Alert
Intruder  Alert
Intruder  Alert
Intruder  Alert
Now it's time for me to make some room
This is not for the fans
I only came to make some noise
I only came to dance
I only came to dance
I only came to dance
I only came to dance
I only came to dance
Remorse for what
Doesn't that give me equal right
For not giving enough 
For not being more perceptive 
For not being aware enough 
For not understanding 
For being stupid
What do you want to call me a murderer for
I've never killed anyone
I don't need to kill anyone
I think it
I have it here
That's right
Lay down
Play dead
Be dead
Base Patrol Base Patrol
No more sympathy
No one should ever want to talk to the dead
No one should ever want to talk to the dead
No one should ever want to talk to the dead
And then Jesus said

Wrapped in plasticGive me your teardrops
And say that you're mine
See how wicked are the restless ones in grace
It's our twisted love
that turns me on
I never wanted to go where the memories lie
In the endless night
I shall but my arms
around this fear
Don't be afraid now
'cos all the things we have
are stronger than life's path
I never wanted to go where the memories lie
It's still better to be alive
than to be dead in heaven
Your touch is so bitter sweet
I want you to embrace me
Pretend to control me
To pull my strings
To be my god be mine
Pretend to love and hate
To take care of me
To be my faith be mine
I always wanted you to be my god
I trusted you but now you're gone
Pretend to control me
To pull my strings
To be my faith be mine
I always wanted you to be my god
I trusted you but now you're gone
I always needed you to be inside me
I guess you'll never never be my god
Burning me up like a fever
Just like dream without a dreamer
I feel it coming
Coming for me
Shed my skin with an evil grin
No one knows where I've been
Without the dreamer
Burning me up like a fever
Just like dream without a dreamer
I hear a distant whisper
Whispering my name
Shed my sin with an evil grin
No one knows what it means to be a dreamer
It's getting dark
Here inside my heart
And the stillness
It covers me
I'll always cherish you
I still can feel
Your tender touch on me
Do you want to take me
Into your heart again
The August rain
Hides my tears from you
And the sadness it drowns me
I'll always cherish you
Trust It's sold out forvever
Lies Ringing my ears
Beyond
The point of no return
Gone Pressure cracks the soul
All those little white lies the fuel for you
As the truth dies all the things you do
Hate How much can I take
Shape So easy to brake
Lust For life is gone
Now The damage is done
All those little white lies the fuel for you
As the truth dies all the things you do
little white lies can't help you now
As the truth dies only way is down
The way is down
Today is good day to end it all
How it all came to this
I don't know
Fool was I to believe
I still can remember
All the things that made me feel so alive
Did I deserve it
This pain walk with me forever
Together pain walk with me
It took you a lifetime
To do this for me no no no
Today is good day to end it all
forever pain walks with me
Together pain walk with me
Forever together
pain walks with me
together forever
Pain walk with me
I don't mind
Trapped inside this void of hopes and dreams
I gave everything to you
And you know that it's true
How can we keep this feeling
When our love is gone
I don't think that I have any faith left
But I don't mind Feeling guilty but it's not me
Who gave I all away
If the truth won't set you free
Then a lie will save you
Can you see the face of the god in me
I am the bringer of your destiny
Well goddamn it's not worth the pain
Sell your soul to someone else
You fool
Well goddamn give my soul a rest
Damn you
If the faith won't break you down
Then you must be the one
Can you feel the hand of the god on you
I am the hammer for your misery
Well goddamn it's not worth the pain
Sell your soul to someone else
You fool
Well goddamn give my soul a rest
Damn you
Sell your soul to someone else
You fool
Well temptation loves you anyway
Damn you
I damn you
From here to a lie it sends you away
Can you get it back tomorrow or today
You stole the dream that wasn't yours
Locked inside behind the closed door
You stole the dream that kept me awake
And crushed my heart
It's never too late
To let the bonfires of time
To make you to make you mine
Can't open mysteries with hollow way
It just feeds the midnight and kills the day
You stole the dream that kept me awake
And crushed my heart
It's the rush you love
All colours turn to black
Ten times I have fallen
'cos I'm too proud to sin
so easily
it can be heavenly
so come on let it go
like a thorn of the rose
It's for all of those
Who have nothing more to give to me
Nine times I have risen
From the eye of the storm
Your light blinds me so easily
Can't find my way back to you
like a thorn of the rose
It's for all of those
Who have nothing more to give
thorn of the rose
Here I am standing above all
Waiting for the moment I fall
I lost it somehow
And i can't get this feeling anymore
I don't know where I am going now
I never thought I could be out of bounds
I'm the queen of the night
Eternal fire by my side
I only wanna hide
And run out of sight
These flames are getting so high
Even if they've seen
What I've always been
The call me the firequeen
An eye for an eye a heart for a heart
That's the way that we play
Up in the cloud where's angels fly
You take my breath away
Your love is my heaven
Now I'm going that way hey hey
And when I get there
You know I'm gonna stay stay stay
You're the dream of a lifetime
Whoa yeah
You're the dream of a lifetime
Yes you are
Caught up in the roles that we play
It's foolish game
There's nothing we can't do or be
If we want it the same
If I had all my chances
To look you away hey hey
Now when I find ya
you know I'm gonna stay stay stay
You're the dream of a lifetime
Whoa yeah
You're the dream of a lifetime
Yes you are
You're taking our words
You turn them inside out
You're stealing our words
For something to write about
It's a secret joke to you
To twist the facts all upside down
Front page fallacy
It's time you hear from me yeah
We're gonna turn you  inside out
You'll twist and turn  inside out
It's time you learn  inside out
Fear for your integrity
You can't hear
What we're trying to say
We're not marionettes
It's our turn to play
Sitting on your throne of greed
Trying to take our thoughts away away
Stand up for the cause
Cause we're all here to stay yeah
Inside out inside out
Now it's a secret joke to you
To twist the facts around around around
Front page fallacy
It's time you hear from me
We're gonna turn you  inside out
Turn you around  inside out
It ain't like it sounds  inside out
I'm the one who speaks for me
We're gonna turn you  inside out
You'll twist and turn  inside out
That is why I sing this song
I know I'm right and you are wrong
Inside out 
One winter night hear the call
Look through her burning eyes
He saw her face a distorted blur
Like a dream that never lies
Fade away to black
Never Never coming back
She's a Shadow in his mind
She's a Love he'll never find
Haunting scenes causing you pain
Making you realize
Climbing the walls going insane
Never to see her eyes
She's a vision in the night
She's a diamond in the firelight of love
She's a vision in the night
She's a memory of a clouded mind
She's a vision of love
One winter night she held his hand
Making him lose his mind
He turned around nowhere to be found
He knew he'd never find her
Light the fire of love tonight
You know I've always had you in my sights
But I finally have the chance to love you
So picture perfect in the light of the stars
Played so close but I want so far
Got struck by the poison of Cupid's arrow
But tomorrow comes the sorrow
Like a story book
It only took one look
'cause last night it seemed
Like things were picture perfect
Want your sudden love every night
I dreamed you'd be got to love you right
But I find it so hard to even approach you
As the stars find your lovely smile
Your fangs like devil were sharply filed
Got to question about your reputation
No longer love you like the way I did
I'll never be a fool like that again
It only took one night
To prove your precious point
Did you think that we could just be friends
Yeah yeah yeah picture perfect
Hey hey hey picture perfect
Last night it seemed
Like things were picture perfect
A long time ago
Like a fool I thought I could love you
The more that I tried
The more that you lied I believed in you
You say you can get
Any man that you want
But keeping one's a different story
The more that you get
The more that you want
The more that you get
The more that you want
And I'm the one to give you some
You break my heart
Just feed on the tears that I'm crying
When we make love
It's all we can do but you're lying
Oh yeah you say you can get
Any man that you want
But holding on's a different story
The more that you get
The more that you want
The more that you get
The more that you take
It's time that I steal your heart away
The more that you get
The more that you want
The more that you get
The more that you get
The more that you take
The more that you want
Down and out like a fox on the run
My baby's gone now I'm the lonely one
On top of that it looks like I'm going bald
My friends are two faced and my moneys gone
I got a ticket when my car broke down
A rainy day now what else could go wrong
Now who's the judge
Whats my crime
Ain't no sentence but I'm still doing time
Cause Misery
Misery Loves Company
Cause Misery Misery
Misery Loves Company
Cold and hungry like a dog in the street
I get a raw deal everyone I meet
The poor get nothing while the rich get fat
Start living good the IRS takes that
So whats it like
To have a smile
Id like to have one but its not my style
Nobody knows when there's cloud in the skies
When there are tears in your eyes
Nobody knows when you're hurting so bad
So if they had 
Far away where the hills turn to plains
I sit and I wonder where you are
I dream at night of the memories that we share
I feel your touch I see your stare
Nobody knows when you're down and out
Nobody cares what it's all about
When it comes to you babe
You know I'll always be there
It just seems
Nobody knows when you're down and out
Silent words a whispered song
Will you still love me when I'm gone 
Now nobody knows what you really matters
Only fools who don't belong
Nobody knows when you're down and out
Nobody cares what it's all about
When it comes to you babe
You know I'll always be there
It just seems
Nobody knows when you're down and out
And in my dreams it never seems that
Nobody knows
The hammer falls under the neon skies
The city lights reflecting in my eyes
Roll the dice a turn of the wheel
Its my turn to call
If it weren't for hard luck
Id have no luck at all
Hard lucks got a hold on me
I bet against the odds
Hard lucks coming down on me
Its in the fall of the cards
Hard luck
The nights my savior she keeps me in the dark
A bad shot it seems Ive missed the mark
Like salt in my wounds
It burns me up inside
Nowhere to run to now
Nowhere to hide
I got some hard luck
It's comin' down to hard luck
All I got is hard luck
Yeah
Somewhere in my mind
Is the fear of growing old
Deep inside my heart
The warmth has turned to cold
My tired eyes slipping away
Tired life
Waiting in the dark
To take his shot at me
Father time's a cruel man
Will I resurrect
Or will I even know
Sorrow is the master plan
Lie in bed at night
Will there be another day
Body aches in pain
Things they don't seem quite the same
Nobody cares No one to share
Tired life
Waiting in the dark
To take his shot at me
Father time's a cruel man
Will I resurrect
Or will I even know
Sorrow is the master plan
Too late  for crawling on your knees
Too late  too late to beg me please
Forget the things you said to me
No way  to ever change my mind
No way  no way to find the time
To change the feelings we once shared
Now I'm laughing in your face
I'm laughing I'm laughing in your face
Too bad  I found my pot of gold
Too bad  too bad you're getting much too old
To play your silly games with me
Look now  at who believes in who
See how  the tables turned on you
Let's see who's smiling now
Now I'm laughing in your face
I'm laughing I'm laughing in your face
And now I'm on the rebound
And I've found my own space
You're feeling rotten and forgotten
While I'm laughing in your face
And now I'm on the rebound
And I've found my own space
You're feeling rotten and forgotten
While I'm laughing in your face
In your face
I'm laughing I'm laughing in your face
I'm laughing I'm laughing
I'm laughing I'm laughing in your face
Laughing in your faceÃÂ
Die
Die under the plague
Taste it as you suffer
You are forever haunted by the Beast
Never to escape from a certain Death
Massive killings by the One judging you to die
Turn around and face the Beast
Fear
Fear your Doom
Crumble in Agony
Accept and Die
With cold blooded skinpeeled aggression
Comes forth a Storm of Terror
A supreme force bringing you all down
To the final massacre
And the Domain of the Superior shall rise
Above the pile of a thousand murdered
Conflict and counterblast
How long do you think your life will last
A fraction of human waste
Does it hold a bitter taste
Red season you re all going to die
Sheer reason you better conceive it
Murder of anyone but your kin
It means you wilL detain the skin
Now then value what is left in your life
Reunion praise the hand that holds the knife
Don t beg you think you saw a discern of grace
You picked the wrong life and wrong method
No wonder it all ends in sin
You should never judge me and my skin
so tell me at last how do you want to die
Red season you re all going to die
Sheer season you better conceive it
Murder of anyone but your kin
It means you will detain the skin
Trapped in Torment   Fucking germ
Trapped in Torment   Lick my sperm
Strapped in Pain   I cut your vein
Strapped in Pain   I ll make blood rain
Try ask me why Lowlife bastard
You could have tried to run while you had legs
But no It s too fucking late
As your own rotten breath brought you down
To my tremendous chamber of Torture
waiting to take you in
For Eternal decomposive Pain
Trapped in Torment   Fucking germ
Trapped in Torment   Lick my sperm
Strapped in Pain   Blood must be shed
Strapped in Pain   You are to be Dead
Trapped in Torment
Like ice no life
All soft
Stunned by its beauty
Coldness captures my mind
Dreams will be experienced
House of Pain Sorrow
Can not affect me only make me stronger
Liquids of Rage and Lust in my veins
As I enter the hall of Death
Unnaturally exited
Rigor mortis   a struggle
Disorderly impatient
No control   explode
Indisposable Deaths
useless and bleeding
As hand from the sky I strike you down I am God
Control of your destiny
The hammer that smoothered you
Over the Gore
I was your last sight
The God who had woundead you
collapse
I feel so alive
The violence I put you through
Over the Gore
I felt so alive as the hammer penetrated you
I stand above and look down at you
I am the god Who woundead you
I stand upon and look down on you
I am the Beast That murdered you
I FEEL SO ALJVE
The violence I put you through
I AM OVER THE GORE
As I stab the Blade through your chest
Consuming your fear and weakness
I fulfil my superior existence
As your filthy blood becomes mine
Deadly Deadly penetration
Blood Blood ejaculation
How does it feel mother fucker
To be thrown useless in the mud
Deadly Deadly penetration
Blood Blood ejaculation
Steaming blood convulsive corpse
A vision of a killer is all you see
I fulfil my superior existence
And you die in a pool of your own stinking blood
A symbol of withhold and the detection
Conceal the hands that cut the throat
Sense the land under the dark coat
Hey man tired of being a loser
Tired of being a redneck
What about a fucking wreck
I think you should put your life under check
Hostility ends any conflict
Just take out any of the specimen click
C mon just give hate a chance
It s not the worst you could possibly adhere to
Chaos theory listen and submit
Your life seems to be like shit
So it s utter human murder
What prevents us from going any further
You are fucking disease
Spill your Blood to the ground
And pay the price of your guilt
Erasement is your only solution
And Death will be your final conclusion
Bleeding wrists
Bleeding wrists
Bleeding wrists
Bleeding wrists
Cold murderous steel upon your flesh
Slice the infected veins
Free those streams groping endless and foolish
Cause you are already trapped
You are fucking disease
Spill your blood to the ground
You are welcome to fucking die
You scornful scum of shame
Die
Die
Man  born with the nature of evil
All inherited the sin from Adam
No man escaped
The commandments  the law
No one were able to fulfil
No man was pure
Everyone's share was death
All was dark  hopelessness ruled
Light intervened
Annihilating darkness
The path of salvation made clear
For the prodigal human race
Given to mankind
For all to receive
The sacrifice of life
For all to believe
This unnatural act of love
A model for succession
The act of forgiveness
A supernatural force
The worship of creation
Seeming endless
But it will end
And every knee shall bow
Thoughts of a coincidental existence
And a futureless world corrodes into the
Spinal chord of the narcissistic man
A paradigm shift for worse
My ego is my god
Given authority by the enlightenment
Of science
The enlightenment of the age of freedom
Freedom  the name in which we legalize all
The name in which we tolerate all
Credibility for truth image for substance
Weakness and failure
 unbearable elements in life
Subtly opposed through an endless flow of
Constantly replaced trends neither allowed
To mature nor to fade
The surroundings
A mirror reflecting the signals
Of admiration that makes my identity
A constant egocentricity providing a
Purging of anything threatening popularity
The peak of this shallowness
Displayed by the socalled stars
In their quest for selfactualisation
This beautiful people experiencing
The illusion of narcissistic prosperity
Uncritically and boundlessly admired
Simply for their own sake
Opposer of the one you claim to serve
Your selfrighteousness
Breeding arrogance and pride
Justifying legalism with a distorted
Perception of submission
Salvation by grace
Christianity by performance
Lust for power desire to rule
The beauty of life
The feeling of guilt your weapon of choice
To control the hearts and thoughts
Of the ones you say you love
They are but shadows
In the periphery of your ego
You are the superChristian
Empowered and installed by God
No sin No mistakes
Psychopath  blinded by hypocrisy
Psychopath  actions of inadequacy
Your moral rearmament of others
Developing shallow minds
With a total lack of identity
Stealing their freedom the one that was
Bought at a high price
No compassion  No love
The intoxication of power feeding your ego
While your 150 are going to hell
Oblivious to the masquerade
The idyllic facade
Pulled over their eyes
To blind them from the truth
Life an abandoned wreck
In motion driven into circles
Never ending circles
Nothing new has taken place
Seems like this place will never change
Just a mercy child
In a blood red cover
Just a mercy child
Covered in truth
A roller coaster of feelings
Steering whatever thought and action
Into a pattern
A pattern repeated
Remove the veils
The glory seems weak
The heart needs the light
Of your glorious presence
Regain control
Of this powerless wreck
Let it complete the course of life
And so it's the end
The hollow end
So speed the process
Again and again
Move as fast as you can
Like the wind
On no end
Horizontal flickering
Like flash before my eyes
Recurring pictures
The holocaust
Over and over
Burnt into my mind
Like bright stars
I will deliver
Your work shall be forever
I will endure
Keep my strength in you
Memories fade
Cease to pause
To measure time
To treasure day
But when I see it
The way I see it
I swear the scissors have moved
At a distance  in space
The constellations have changed
The incomprehensibility of
A love so pure
Too good to be true
It seems
This preposterous act of empathy
Unveiling my insufficiency
The will of God accomplished
Redemption revealed
Realize repent receive
Confession of inadequacy
Initiate admit believe
I am not my own
 I belong to he who sacrificed
The glory of eternity and fullness of peace
To fathom this mystery
Is beyond what I can express
That he'd endure this path of pain
Realize repent receive
Confession of inadequacy
Initiate admit believe
Freedom
The incarnation of the one I am
Inverting the course of history
Hiding the kingdom in the heart of man
For him to share the grace of God
Where will I return my misgiven motions
Quell and subside the quivering vigour
The inevitable thrust
That swells inside
And drives me off the edge
The bleeding ill that breeds me on mercy
Ruthless and sinister
Obsessive beyond my reach
Metamorphosis
Release me from fury
Metamorphosis
Transforming energy
Will I tread on broken glass
And undisguised
Set atrocities aside
Scrape the surface
Clean from abominations
With a single word
Conquer wrath
Disposed to the evils that haunt me in sleep
They shake the break of dawn
Careless and free
And spear me down
Relentlessly
Smitten with burns
They pierce my mind
They all own their own place in darkness
Light as they may seem as day
Scrape the surface
Clean from abominations
Let go the calamities inside
And respond to the streams of emotion
Strengthened individuals
Encouraged for unity
We've been pushed to the limit
Through an established motivation
Gathered in love to Christ our head
Come on let's join in synergy
Conspiracy constructed with hope in sight
A rebellious enthusiasm  united by Christ
To vulcanise the spirit filled thrash forever
Revitalization is what we want to see
Of the moving solidarity
By given strength community will be found
Let's exploit our nerve of optimism
By flash we'll go separate ways
By spirit we'll unite
It's time to make a change of mind
To conquer egocentricity
Together we will conjure up
A zealous wish to sacrifice the singularity
For the growth of this body
For the kingdom's progress
Will you be there when I call Will you be there
Will you be there when I fall will you be there
Will you be there 
Will you be there when the darkness has no end
Will you be there when the light descends
Will you be there 
Yes I'll be there when you call out my name
Yes I'll be there  I'm your light take my hand
Yes I'll be there I will be there
The Plague threatening the status quo
Imposed afflictions between
Leviathan and the divine
Who's to blame
And who's to say it isn't so
Emancipation
Beyond the bare bone
Liberation
Of spirit and soul
The unclear course of nature
Violations separations
For every action and reaction
A matter of consequence
Ways of changing the score
But the Lord comforts me more
Than the riches of the earth
The cares of the world
For the purse is a dead cause
Far worse than woe
And carries the stamp of human vanity
Immediate gratification of desires
The meaning of life
This propagator of a
Consumeristic lifestyle
So seemingly benign
This is your entitlement
Living an affluent life
A scrap conduction
A shallow state of mind
The delusion of their raison d'etre
Being nothing more than the
Accumulation of mere things
Driven into the consciousness
Of precious young minds
An instrument for turning of the brain
An instrument for death
Compellingly perverted to create
A reality for hiding truth
Creating a window for
Spiritual blessings on sale
No arduous sacrifice or demands
No restraint of passion
No spiritual disciplines No God
This is your religion
Feeling without intellectual content
This is your religion
Nihilism 2002Wasting time on my own thoughts
Pulling me in so deep
Thoughts of you in our little world
It makes me cold
It makes me weak
I self destructed
I reconstructed
I owe this all to you
For a while you let me forget myself
But once again
The real me is alive
I put myself here
Look what it's done to me
I'll keep myself here
Now watch me bleed
I wanted to believe in you
I tried to believe in the lie
It was a lie
Now you see what it did to me
It was a lie
I'm self reliant
I'm self confidement
I owe this all to you
You showed me that I'm the only one I know
So once again
The real me is alive
I put myself here
Look what it's done to me
I'll keep myself here
Now watch me bleed
I was taken apart by what I never knew
I was taken apart
The ugly part of you
The ugly part of you
Spend time with the broken man
I owe this all to you
I was taken apart by what I never knew
I was taken apart
The ugly part of you
You
I was awake
Alone  afraid  confused
The only love I knew
The only love I knew
You were the only love I knew
And I was afraid
Scars don't heal
When they grow on the inside
The mind can't kill
What it sees on the outside
Too young to know
Too young to understand
Force fed the real thing
I didn't know what it meant back then
And now you wonder what went wrong
How can you wonder what went wrong
Love wasn't explained
Try spending that much time alone
I know this pain
Over time it only grows
Didn't want to believe
Tried not to let it show
Everything inside me
You took more than you'll ever know
And now you wonder what went wrong
How can you wonder
You were wrong
Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of man
Destroyed  destroyed
Fistful of control
You planted this seed inside
Too many times
Too many times
This time you can't deny
You were wrong
Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of man
Destroyed  destroyed
I was afraid  I was alone  confused
I was afraid  I was afraid
You were the only love I knew
And I was afraid  afraid
Pieces of man
I'm learning the hard way what I am
Pieces of me
Destroyed  destroyed
You were wrong
Like an animal
Senses fear
Chills up my spine
I know you're here
It's been so long
So what did you expect
I know where you've been
And I disrespect
I feel sickened
I choke and spit up words
They all mean nothing
It's all absurd
Your body has been used up
Your mind has changed direction
I can't believe I touched you
I can't believe it
Inside I wish it wasn't true
It makes it hard to look at you
Ugly I feel
My body's inside you
Tongue in  tongue out
I can taste him on you
You're naked as a child
Your innocence is gone
Given away for nothing
And I hate what's left
Inside I wish it wasn't true
I makes it hard to look at you
I close my eyes  I close my mind
But it makes nothing go away
Look back in anger
Look back in pain
Look back in disrespect
It's you I can't respect
I look back in anger
And it's so hard to look back
I close my eyes  I close my mind
But it makes nothing go away
This time you couldn't walk away from me
This time there was nowhere you could hide
This time I wanted all the answers
This time I really thought I was prepared
But now I know
I know I wasn't ready
And now I know
I know what it is to burn
I know what it is to burn
This time you couldn't turn your back on me
This time you had to leave me paralyzed
This time I thought it's what I wanted
This time I know that I was wrong
'Cause I know about it this time
I thought I wasn't human
This time I really thought I wouldn't feel
I wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't feel
I wish I could forget
But this time it's for real
Some things you just don't want to hear
Not this time
But now I know
I know I wasn't ready
And now I know
I know what it is to burn
I wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't feel
I wish I could forget
But this time it's for real
I wish I didn't know
I wish I didn't feel
I wish I could forget
But this time I know what it is to burn
I feel ugly I'm so tired
Trying to make it all make sense
I ask you to hold me
Hold me like never before
I might break
I don't know how much more I can take
I ask you
It's getting to me again
I know you've never seen me like this
It's getting to me again
You don't want to see me like this
I'm spitting up life again
I'm feeling it all again
Choking
I don't want you to see me like this
Lay your hands on me
Your skin is warm
You could heal me  heal me
Just show me there's more
I know you've never seen me like this
I never wanted you to see me like this
Choking
I don't want you to see me lie this
I don't want you to see me lie this
I don't want you to see me lie this
I never wanted any of this
Look at how they look at you
Used up again
Feel
Feel how they're treating you
Only for their use again
Respect
They've never seen it
Another one is how they see it
Only in this to be used
You're only in this to be used
Hands on mine
Hands all over me
Scarring my mind so easily
Hands all over you
Tearing every part of me
Hands all over you
There's always something that reminds me
I've been there before
Deep inside the innocent
I've laid there before
Feeling transparent
But this time it's you
I'm in love with what they've all used
I'm afraid to say it
I know you know it
Hands on mine
Hands all over me
Scarring my mind so easily
Hands all over you
Tearing every part of me
Hands all over you
There's always something that reminds me
Live  lust  life
Live  I tried to live
Lust  I tried to forget
Life  I tried
But it's you
I lay here silent
How do I tell her
How far away I feel
With every breath she tries to hold tighter
But far away is all I feel
You needed a hand and I tried to be that hand
But life is yours to hold
Strap down tight it's going to be a long ride
It's time you ride alone
Then she said I found  god
But I'm not the god you see
Don't leave me like this
Alone she said
I died to be with you
I took my own life with my own hands
Listen to me
'Cause I can't save you
Listen to me  listen
I've got to save myself
Then she said I found  god
But I'm not the god you see
Put your nails in me
She said she's never felt alive
Then she said I found  god
But I'm not the god you see
And could never be
No I can't save you
Put your nails in me
Too much time  has gone by
Take a look back on that life
I see your eyes  I see myself
And I can't look back on that life
Forced to listen  forced to learn
With the sounds of the lonely
I remember now  it takes me down
Leave me  leave me  now
Dislocated  I walked away
You feel the walls  begin to build
You were the one
I'm sorry but you could've been anyone
I see you now  you show me everything
Forced to listen  forced to learn
To the sounds of being all alone
I remember now  it takes me down
Leave me  leave me  now
I remember now  it takes me down
Leave me  leave me
It never leaves  never
I feel so different now
It all feels so different now
I had you in my life once
I had that feeling of the real thing once
But now you're gone
And that's all gone
Inside I held on to you once
I never knew there was two of us once
But now I'm alone
And it's all gone
I gave my body and my mind to you once
I thought it all revolved around you once
I know better now
But I'm too far gone
I would have died for you once
And I thought it would have mattered to you once
But now you're gone and I'm so far gone
And I'm wrapping my arms around myself
I'm free
I hold onto all that I am
But I know that the one I hold onto is dying
I feel so different now
It all feels so different now
So you don't believe
No you don't believe
Said you can't believe
You can't believe in me
Well I've learned to need
And I've learned to need
And I've learned to need that I don't need you
You were something
I thought you were everything
You were nothing
Somehow you were everything
But I forgive myself
I forgive myself
I'll learn to forgive myself for what I've done
I could taste it  I could feel it
I became it  and I want it
It was something
I thought it was everything
It was nothing
It turned into everything
If I could  yeah I would
If I could  everything
If I could  yeah I would
If I could
So I've gone too far
Have I gone too far
Yeah I've gone too far
So what what is too far
Am I breathing
Am I bleeding
Am I dying
I just don't know
It was something  it was something
I thought it was everything
It was nothing  it was nothing
It turned into everything
If I could  yeah I would
If I could  everything
If I could  yeah I would
If I could
There is no choice but to look inside
Look around you
They'll let you down
They'll disappoint you
They'll take you to the bottom
And they'll leave you there
They'll let you down
Look around you
You don't need this
I thought it was everything
If I could  yeah I would
If I could  everything
If I could  yeah I would
If I could
Goodbye
Goodbye to everything
The Arockalypse
Attention class  Here we come
We kick your ass  That's lesson one
I know you've been living in heresy
Correction's what you need
Less isn't more  less is less
The more the better  the most the best
You gotta turn up the amps past overload
Eardrums will explode
We are what we want to be
Monsters of rock we are for real
Stand up for what you believe and shout
Hail in the name of rock and roll
Hail in the name of rock and roll
Hail in the name of rock and roll
Breathing fire spitting blood
Biting off the heads of bats and doves
Dragon boots and guillotines
That's what I want to see
We're the SMF with metal hearts
Got love machines we're breaking the law
We've got the looks that kill
We're the youth gone wild
We're the creatures of the night
We are what we want to be
Monsters of rock we are for real
Stand up for what you believe and shout
Hail in the name of rock and roll
Hail in the name of rock and roll
Hail in the name of rock and roll
Big drums leather and chains
Loud guitars grimace and flames
The twofinger signs
Raised fists up high
She lures you in with intention
Looks like the girl next door
But it's blood and sticky floors
That really turn her on
She's got a body to die for
You touch it and you will
She's got a face of an angel
And an urge to kill
She's sanctified by death
Hey Stay away from the lady night
Hey Don't you mess with the devil's bride
You gotta pull out
Can't you feel the darkness falling
Get the hell out
Can't you hear the heaven's roaring
The Deadite girls gone wild
Have casket will travel
She's the best of the worst
She'll chew on your neckbone
To quench her thirst
The black widow entraps you
Oh boy you're in for a treat
She's the queen of beasts
She's a demon in heat
She's sanctified by death
Hey Stay away from the lady night
Hey Don't you mess with the devil's bride
You gotta pull out
Can't you feel the darkness falling
Get the hell out
Can't you hear the heaven's roaring
The Deadite girls gone wild
No don't thank heaven for little girls no
When their eyes turn white as pearls
You wanna put it inside
You're gonna lose it she bites
Then she'll suck you dry
Then she'll suck you dry
Hey Stay away from the lady night
Hey Don't you mess with the devil's bride
You gotta pull out
Can't you feel the darkness falling
Get the hell out
Can't you hear the heaven's roaring
The Deadite girls gone wild
Was it already there in the womb
Were we pulled out way too soon
Were we quiet too long Were we too small
Or were we dropped on the floor
Could it be something we ate
Did they let us stay up too late
Were there not enough rules
Did we get too much love
Was it something they taught us in school
'Cause inside something bad's awakened
The evil opens it's eyes
The temper's rising and the house is shaking
To get out is no longer an option
These are the deeds of the beast
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
Whoahwoah
We must have lost our minds
'cause we might lose our heads
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
Whoahwoah
See us pretty brides and the evil we wed
Oh Lord we play with the dead
Was it something we saw on TV
The films that were gross and obscene
Is it the clothes and the blackdyed hair
Or were we just not aware
There must have been some dangerous toys
And the music sings of murderous ploys
It's not like we did not have a choice
Backward masking gives the devil a voice
'Cause inside something bad's awakened
The evil opens it's eyes
The temper's rising and the house is shaking
To get out is no longer an option
These are the deeds of the beast
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
Whoahwoah
We must have lost our minds
'cause we might lose our heads
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
Whoahwoah
See us pretty brides and the evil we wed
Oh Lord we play with the dead
To get out is no longer an option
These are the deeds of the beast
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
Whoahwoah
We must have lost our minds
'cause we might lose our heads
We're the kids who wanna play with the dead
Whoahwoah
See us pretty brides and the evil we wed
Oh Lord
Now we wanna play with the dead
We lose our heads
Oh Lord now we play with the dead
We lose our heads
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord now we play with the dead
You did the trick

You won't be waiting for my return
I promise baby  You'll burn
Now it snows in hell
This is the day foretold till death do us apart
Now it snows in hell
I've gone away but I've got you in my heart
All frozen and scarred

How did you not get caught
Your deed will spawn
A fate beyond your making
You won't be waiting for my return
I promise baby  You'll burn
Now it snows in hell  We're done masquerading
This is the day foretold till death do us apart
Now it snows in hell  No you won't be waiting

All frozen and scarred

My hands will grab you through the dirt
I giveth  I taketh away
Witness my rebirth from the devils churn
Hell  We're done masquerading
This is the day foretold till death do us apart
Now it snows in hell  No you won't be waiting
I've gone away but I've got you in my heart
All frozen and scarred
Hell  We're done masquerading
This is the day foretold till death do us apart
Now it snows in hell  No you won't be waiting

All frozen and scarred

Hard Rock Hallelujah
The saints are crippled
On this sinners' night
Lost are the lambs with no guiding light
The walls come down like thunder
The rocks about to roll
It's The Arockalypse
Now bare your soul
All we need is lightning
With power and might
Striking down the prophets of false
As the moon is rising
Give us the sign
Now let us rise up in awe
Demons and angels all in one have arrived
In God's creation supernatural high
The true believers
Thou shall be saved
Brothers and sisters keep strong in the faith
On the day of Rockoning
It's who dares wins
You will see the jokers soon'll be the new kings
All we need is lightning
With power and might
Striking down the prophets of false
As the moon is rising
Give us the sign
Now let us rise up in awe
Demons and angels all in one have arrived
In God's creation supernatural high
Wings on my back
I got horns on my head
My fangs are sharp
And my eyes are red
Not quite an angel
Or the one that fell
Now choose to join us or go straight to Hell
Hard Rock Hallelujah
Demons and angels all in one have arrived
In God's creation supernatural high
You know you saw them but noone ever listens
Wreaking havoc on your perfect world
They are the tricking trolls
They got the bell that tolls
Flash at the edge of your sight
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
They only come out at night
The shadows breathe with a venom like no other
Wreaking havoc on your perfect world
They are the tricking trolls
They got the bell that tolls
Flash at the edge of your sight
They only come out at night
Don't know what's at stake
I think they're right beside me
I gotta stay awake
And keep them all from biting
They only come out at night
You got your invitation
A family dinner and tonight you will meet
No need for hesitation sugar
We're gonna love you and it's all we can eat
The steaks ala carte mama makes from the heart
And my pa's such a gourmet for gore
Jammed eyes bleeding herbs
Banquet dining is worth dying for
At the chainsaw  chainsaw buffet
The secret ingredient screams
You're my main course
At the chainsaw buffet
Feed on maneaters's cuisine
At the chainsaw  chainsaw buffet
Mother said that you were a sweet chic
Nice day for a picnic
They'll be delighted only they are the lunch
The steaks ala carte mama makes from the heart
And my pa's such a gourmet for gore
Jammed eyes bleeding herbs
Banquet dining is worth dying for
At the chainsaw  chainsaw buffet
The secret ingredient screams
You're my main course
At the chainsaw buffet
Feed on maneaters's cuisine
Boiling your blood 'till it steams
At the chainsaw  chainsaw buffet
Pigtails
The cutest smiles
But it's all delusion
Kneesocks
The sweetest eyes
It's just a grand illusion
When they're bad
They just get better
Like saints full of sin
And again the constrictor queens
Will shed their skin
All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good
Good to be bad
SheLurks
In a girl disguise
You'll fall into confusion
Now they might
Play it nice
But you're heading for an execution
When they're bad
They just get better
Like saints full of sin
And again the constrictor queens
Will shed their skin
All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good
Good to be bad
Yeah yeah yeah
All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good
They know it's good
All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good
Good to be bad
All the naughty lordi girls
They know it's good to be bad
They're gonna claw before they purr
They know it's good
Good to be bad
Now beware the streets tonight
Lay low till the sunrise
The undead Casanovas hunt for love
You may
Look the doors drop the blinds
Keep quiet and stay inside
But nothing helps when push comes to shove
Bequeth thy loving  My body's cold
On the Night of the loving dead
Love the unliving no skins attached
On the Night of the loving dead
The Night of the loving dead
Dressing sharp au naturel
Looking drop dead gorgeous
Sins of the rotten flesh for you to hold
My caress is terminal
'cause my touch is torture
There's no way in hell I'll let you go
Bequeth thy loving  My body's cold
On the Night of the loving dead
Love the unliving no skins attached
On the Night of the loving dead
The Night of the loving dead
Six feet underground
If I had a heart you would make it pound
You make the dead come alive
On the Night of the loving dead
Love the unliving no skins attached
On the Night of the loving dead
Love the unliving no skins attached
On the Night of the loving dead
Love the unliving no skins attached
On the Night of the loving dead
The Night of the loving dead
You've been pushed around
Until you mumble
Beaten to the ground
But you won't crumble
They strike you dumb
They bring you down
They keep you on the losing end
They tell your right is wrong
Your high is low
So give 'em hell
Kick up a row
We're the Supermonstars
We chant the anthem of the Phantoms
Deal out the blows
Like a Supermonstar
We are humble to none
They can't make you out
That makes you bogus
They think they know
What we're about
But they just don't know us
They strike you dumb
They bring you down
They keep you on the losing end
They tell your right is wrong
Your high is low
So give 'em hell
Kick up a row
We're the Supermonstars
We chant the anthem of the Phantoms
Deal out the blows
Like a Supermonstar
We are humble to none
Kick up a row
We're the Supermonstars
We chant the anthem of the Phantoms
Deal out the blows
Like a Supermonstar
We are humble to none
Kick up a row
We're the Supermonstars
We chant the anthem of the Phantoms
Deal out the blows
Like a Supermonstar
We are humble to none
Would you love a monsterman
Could you understand
Beauty of the beast
Yeah I would kill
Yeah I would freeze all hell over
Just to get a chill
Yeah I would slay
Yeah I would mame
Yeah I would vanish in thin air
And reappear again
Be right in the squares
Yeah I would be sincere
Yeah I would lie

Waking up the dead to get a thrill
I say yeah I say yeah
Would you love a monsterman
Could you understand
Beauty of the beast
I would do it all for you
Would you do it all
Do it all for me
Take the time
You'll be fine
Yeah there is nothing wrong with this
You ain't commit no crime
You don't know why
We pass you by
You search for something never found
Along these lines
Someday you may turn around and terrify
You can't denyyou crucify
Would you get down in the gutter
Swallowing your pride
I say yeah I say yeah
All that you get
Is much less than you deserve
Leaving for now
Someday I may return
Would you love a monsterman
Your shindig's kinda boring
Shall I strike the punch with cianede
I gotta warn you
You'll need a coroner tonight
If you see me better flee me
If you hear me better fear me
I'll help you from the fryer
Into the fire
Na na na na na
Calling Mr Killjoy
I'm the death of every party
Na na na na na
Calling Mr Killjoy
And I don't care if you don't like me NO
Though I'm here to fix your troubles
Brute force applied with some finess
Oh when people are the problem
My hatchet always works the best Oh yes it will
If you see me better flee me
If you hear me better fear me
I'll help you from the fryer
Into the fire
I made you suffer and it doesn't feel right
How rude of me
A quick beheading will end your fright
I gave you deep red roses
The thorns cut your hands
We are an owl and a mouse's doomed romance
Now I would like to fondle
But my nails rip your skin
My most tender kiss stings your lips like pins
Your cries they make no difference
I'll always love you the same
Now I'll try to restrain myself
'Cause my affection means pain
Honey honey
Lemme hug you like a spider
Honey honey
Lemme give you evilove
Honey honey
Lemme kiss you like a viper
Open up your heart
Receive my evilove
Our night in Paris with candles
Ended up in flames
And cupid's arrow mangled your pretty face
I wanna be your dreamdate
Who takes away your breath
But I'm the man of your nightmares
The gentleman death
Your cries they make no difference
I'll always love you the same
Now I'll try to restrain myself
'Cause my affection means pain
Receive my evilove x3My stride can't be broken
Always gaining ground
It'll prove you wrong
In steel my will is forged
Spark lights the friction
Mountains set in motion
Its not a slow burn
This is a firestorm
Impetus
Driven every wave
Catalyst
Master my influence
My stride cant be broken
Always gaining ground
Ill prove you wrong
In steel my will is forged
Spark lights the friction
Mountains set in motion
Its not a slow burn
This is a firestorm
Impetus
Driving every wave
Catalyst
Master of my influence
Dominate
Trials of triumph
Incinerate
Conquer all my fears
Dominate
My stride can't be broken
Mountains set in motion
Ill prove you wrong
In steel my will is forged
This is your end
No one to save you
Tore a hole through me
Left me for dead
Tare down your walls
To fill my soul
Consume this hate
To make me whole
This is who I am
How does it feel to loose it all
No one left to take the fall
Now I'm the one in control
These thoughts of you
Turn me to stone
Tare down your walls
To fill my soul
Consume this hate
To make me whole
This is who I am
How does it feel
To lose it all
No one left to take the fall
Now I'm the one in control
These thoughts of you
Turn me to stone
Crush it all today
So there is no tomorrow
I have no regret
I feel no remorse
You tried to take my life
And now I'm stronger than every
No regret
No remorse
Ill change nothing from the past
This has made me
Who I am
I will feed on this hatred
This is your end
No one to save you
Another day of breathing
Acrid and thick I inhale
Feel it burn inside
When will the smoke clear
Seems like its been forever
Seen only death and disease
With every breath I'm dying
See my fate in from of me
There will be no dawn for man
Rotting minds have faded
Damned us to years of flame
Use to fear a life in hell
Now I live it everyday
There will be no dawn for man
Humanity has collapsed
This is the burning age
Never cease until we are ash
There will be no dawn for man
Another day of breathing
Every wake brings more decay
There will be no dawn for man
This is the burning age
Another day of breathing
Every wake brings more decay
There will be no dawn for man
This is the burning age
Think you are alone
You have never been more wrong
This affliction
Kills a piece of us all
Drowning inside out
Swallow fatal frame
Don't hold your breath
I swear you will breathe again
This is a promise
All I have in my heart
Strength for both of us
Pull you from the shadows
This blight wont take your life
Scour the rust from your veins
I feel your pain
Shedding mortal remains
Put your mind at ease
You aren't on your own
With you all the way
Fight this together
This is a promise
To a fallen friend
If you are lost
I swear we will meet again
Think you are alone
You've never been more wrong
This affliction
Kills a piece of us all
Drowning inside out
Swallow fatal frame
Don't hold your breath
I swear you will breathe again
This is a promise
This is a promise
All I have in my heart
Strength for both of us
Pull you from the shadows
Get up get on your feet
I watched long enough
Time is now to make things right
We must overcome gone on for to long
Where do you cross the line
Kept us down and out
Got rich while we were blind
You always had our trust
Now you turned on us
Sold your soul
To burn us all
Actions beyond forgiveness
Lies wont be forgotten
Take no prisoners
Destroy them all
Riseto your feet
Fight  tooth and nail
Rise  brothers in arms
Fight  we will prevail
Get up get on your feet
I watched long enough
Time is now to make things right
We must overcome

Rise  brothers in arms
Fight  we will prevail
Gave our faith
Took our trust
Sold us out
Pay in blood
Rise  to your feet
Fight  tooth and nail
Rise  brothers in arms
Fight  we will prevail
Try and hold me back
You fail every time
No chains can restrain
Level barriers one by one
Only one way to go
Thats up above the rest
Breath through every wall
Iron will
I wont give up
Never again give in to you
Cant make me turn away
Ill never look away
This goes beyond desire
Driven by my goals
Too determined to be defeated
Steadfast on solid ground
Anchored heart
Try and hold me back
You fail every time
No chains can restrain
Level barriers one by one
I wont give up
Never give in to you
Cant make me turn away
Ill never look away
This goes beyond desire
Driven by my goals
Too determined to be defeated
Steadfast on solid ground
Anchored heart
Iron will
Too determined to be defeated
Anchored heart
Steadfast on solid ground
I wont give up
Never give in to you
Cant make me turn away
Ill never look away
This goes beyond desire
Driven by my goals
Too determined to be defeated
Steadfast on solid ground
No innocent ignorance
Constant impetuous
Commit to nothing
What have you become
Remain oblivious this world cold and calloused
Chew you up spit you out
And never bat an eye
Cant you see I'm reaching out to you
Pick up the pieces I am torn in two
No innocent ignorance
Constant impetuous
Remain oblivious
Your heart cold and calloused
Cant you see I'm reaching out to you
Just a friend trying to pull you through
Never wanted
Patience thinning
All that I have
You turn it away
Fallen on deaf ears
You suffer in silence
All that I have
You turn it away
Fallen on deaf ears
You suffer in silence
Deny my hand
You never learn
You are forsaken
All that I have
Turn it away
Fall on deaf ears
Suffer in silence
One day you'll find
Hide too many lies
Behind your eyes
I see everything
You cant run from this
You hide your face in shame
How can you life this way
Your life's a fallacy
You cant run from this
You hide your face in shame
How can you live this way
You're lifeless
Took my strength for weakness
You called yourself a friend
Cover lies with other lies
Life of sorrow
One day you'll find
Hide too many lies
Behind your eyes
I see everything
You cant run from this
You hide your face in shame
How can you live this way
You're lifeless
Brought down
This on yourself
Enshroud
No truth within yourself
Brought down
Enshroud
Brought down
No truth within yourself
Shudder at the though
How distant you became
Your eyes clouded over
Haunted by yesterday
Dissipate
Right in front of me
Desolate
Feeding on emptiness
Soul bled
Left you hollow
Dissipate
Right in front of me
Undertow
Sucked you down
Desolate
Feeding on emptiness
Soul bled
Left you hollow
Hollow
You are hollow
Shudder at the thought
How distant you became
Your eyes clouded over
Haunted by yesterday
Scarred from the inside
Hard times bitter tears
Gave in too easily
Victim of memories
Dissipate
Right in front of me
Undertow sucked you down
Desolate
Feeding on emptiness
Soul bled left you hollow
Soul bled
Left you hollow
You are hollow
Over before the start
Our eyes will never meet again
Cry after cry lie after lie
Built upon deceit
You know what I believe
No a fucking word
With all you fabricate
How can you grip reality
Show now mercy
Vengeance mine
Deception led to nothing
That is what you are
Over before the start
Your eyes will never meet again
Show no mercy
Vengeance mine
Deception led to nothing
That is what you are
Over before the start
Our eyes will never meet again
Show no mercy
Nothing remains vengeance mine
Eye for an eye
Do you know me
Tell me what you believe
How dare you judge me
I am more than what you see
I made this life
And everyone a friend
Still you turned on me
Shown true colors
You never listen
You hear the sound
You never listen
And fuck the words
Never ending every things become a trend
I hope you had your fill
Cause this is where the bleeding ends
Slowly dying
Were worked down to the bone
Go against the grain
Or die alone
I wont change for you
Cause you will never change
I live my life everyday
You just fail and fade away
Dare you judge
Turn on me
You just fail
Fade away
One man to rule them all
Conceived son of God
He will destroy us
Bleed the world dry
Power corrupted
Infected mind
Unholy messenger
Drank blood of the martyr
Deceived and in denial
Betrayed by belief
Enslaved to an enemy
Involved in our prayers
Darkened harvest
Reaped their souls
Lambs to the slaughter
Kingdom undone
The sleeper has awaken
Lay down your crown your reign is over
Raging angles battle no more
Might have fallen
Lay down your crown your reign is over
The sleeper has awaken
One man to rule them all
Conceived son of God
Power corrupted
Infected mind
Achieved and in denial
Betrayed by belief
Lambs to the slaughter
Kingdom undone
The sleeper has awaken
Raging angles battle no more
Kingdom undone your throne in ruins
Enemy of the world praise our new lord
Conceived and in denial
Betrayed by belief
Lambs to the slaughter
Kingdom undone
The sleeper has awaken
Annihilation
Exterminate
Pressure mounting
Watch every move
Weight of the world
Crushing you
Cripple order
Destroy control
Death at the doorstep
Strings us all
Ever fleeting
Hope is broken
Dead lights
Fall on our eyes
Kiss of death
Brings our demise
On your knees
Beg to an empty heaven
Exterminate
Annihilation
I was born to murder this world
Suffer to stay alive
Bleed out the week
Only the damned survive
Her tongue tracing my only ear
She sways with the breaking branches
While her shadow lie dormant in fear
The limbs split with my subliminal self
Separating us at the soul
Failing to see what shes done in the darkness
Although apart we are still one
Counting the waves of a shattered illusion
Reassembled struggling for clarity
All sense torn through murky lenses
I see reality crumble before me
Writhing through inescapable space
My arms chained to the everfalling floor
I spiral through my own existence
All that was is now never more
The world stops as we contort back to one frame
Deep fog penetrating my flesh
Her laughter echoing off nothingness
As Im trapped in spry optical
Flux
Extracted from existence
Immersed in nothingness
Like a drain torn from the tit
I drown in thirst for substance
My veins bled dry
All marrow sucked from my bones
The weight of my cognition
Disordered illogical
Eternal sleep eluding me
I drift through voices left unfound
My vision oscillates unmeasured
Once I obtain the ground
The undefined wall between myself and matter
Evaporated
The first light of the aeons past
I struggle to stand
Traversing the gap of realms I imbibe my
Vigor once again
My might restored
Her fate is sealed
Trampling the weak
Splintering underfoot
Crush the trees
From whence the voices came
Rend the bodies from the earth
Kneel my subjects
Breaking backs and wills of man
Kneel my objects
From the clouds of chaos
Her hourglass is seen
She too has crossed
To the realm of dreams
Her body tangible
The black fades green
Her many mouths screaming the scream of
A mute banshee
I tear out her throat and I swallow it whole
Her mountains
Collapse at the sight
Of domination imploding
Her oceans
Rage infernally
As the voices permeate my
Memories
Returning as falsehoods
What in this world is real
Her frame lies before me
With short quivering breaths
Her struggle hypnotic
My hand gave her death
Debris becomes one with
Her fragmented soul
As the life leaves her eyes
The light leaves my own
Trapped in the orbit of time
Ahead of us lies the past
Through death she cannot leave
Stand strong pride you feel
Obey march raise your banners
Kill die in the fields of steel
Truth faith what you fight for
Kill rape eternal glory
Blood gore shining heroes
Spell write a bloody history
We fight we kill we die
We play we dance
To a symphony of death
Wars pride waving colours
Pain Death final solution
Look see what are we doing
Kill die for false illusions
Tears fall for dying children
No more human sanity
Take life sacrifice your child
You've got the feeling turn on
the lights
YOu feel the power rising
lightning strikes the sky
Siw million people wanna see the
band
The hit the stage tonight
guitars in our hands
Watch out
We're backback to the roots
Heavy metal rules
We're backback to the roots
Heavy metal
You've got the rythm we've got
the beat
We turn the music loud burn in
the heat
Look to the left look to the
right
Look into my eye I'm ready to
fight
I still remember long winter
nights
Frightning stories of dark and
light
Stories of horror of life and
death
About a house of horror
That rose from evil's breath
Voices in the darkness
Calling out my name
I'm drawn up to the house
Feeling agony and pain
Welcome to my house of horror
Come on inhouse of horror
Welcome to my house of horror
Many have come  few have gone
The Peaper's madness there's no
escape
He gives me dreams there's just
a fake
He holds my heart fingers cold
as ice
He claims my soul as a sacrifice
We make it loud and proud
We wanna see your hands
tonight
We possess the power
And we know we have the
right
Don't turn away
Don't turn away
Rock it and roll it
Don't turn away
Don't turn away
Rock it
We come back without a
warning
We will take control
Can't you feel the magic
And the fire in their souls
Shout it out
We're ready to rock now
Shout it out
Loud and proud
Shout it out
We're ready to rock now
Shout it out
We will lead you day by day
And you can't run and hide
We will keep on rockin
Our souls are filled with
pride
Let's try reaching for the
sky
Hang on and you're gonna die
Our lives can turn so sweet
Child with an innocent smile
Destroys me all the while
Don't be fooled when he
cries
You sit there watching all
go down
Live your life to a
different sound
You fought for freedom
you're fighting still
You'll never get fortune
pay your bill
More lies more promises
We all live in a world of
fools
More lies more promises
We all live in a world of
fools
In a world of fools
Nobody vomes to show you a
line
Open your eyes and find the
sign
And now you're awventy to
old to die
More and more you accept
that's all a lie
Evil thoughts and evil
doings
Cold alone you hang in ruins
You're living fast now life
goes over
Now you're know you are a
loser
Bloody dreams and nice white
rats
Death is calling for your
head
You can't escape you run for
cover
Say good by and tell your
mother
I'm wild  wild and
dangerous
I'm wild  wild and
dangerous
Empty bottles and empty
glasses
The day is over you waiting
for darkness
Night by night the same
procedure
You never listen to the
preacher
MrBlackman and MrWhitehead
Taking your soul and brings
you dead
Take the key unlock the
door
See the light that marks the
right floor
She's wild  wild and
dangerous
She's wild  wild and
dangerous
Bloody dreams and nice white
rats
Death is calling for your
head
You can't escape you run for
cover
Say good by and tell your
mummy
I'm wild  wild and
dangerous
I'm wild  wild and
dangerous
She's wild  wild and
dangerous
She's wild  wild and
dangerousStruggle against the winds
To tether the sails of this craft
A journey for you to begin
The elders show you the path
My journey takes me
Far and wide
Ill show you my struggles against the tide
Distant and far I will always roam
My thoughts return to hearth and home
I am carried to distant lands
I tread on foreign sands
In the company of my brothers in arms
I find my way by the northern stars
I will come back home
Chariot gleams in golden sun
Elude the world with two horses drawn
Sky ablaze with daughters fire
With her fortune brings a new light
Upon cosmic tides endlessly she rides
Celestial fire burns bright
Eclipsing the canopy of night
Beyond shines infinite spark
Illuminating from the eternal dark
The wolf always gaining the wolf biding his time
For we will witness the earth in ruins
The day the sun no longer shines
The casting takes place
Secret of steel entwined when read
Life fading in like flames of solstice suns
For when it is ready
Reveal that to me
Enter into ancestral recall
Delve into oceans deep in the past
perhaps then it could possibly be
Fair when held against the measure of a child
Who for the first time is learning their craft
Tread high peaks 
Hidden gold
Insult draws sword
Blood drips from cord
Foul thirst quenched
O crimson sate
Then roasted heart
Flesh to partake
Lo That speech of which I hear
Of larks Nuthatches sky dwellers
Their intent made clear to me
Nothing stands obscured
Whispers to wind
A breath
A cut
A wound
Drank of his blood
Ate of his heart
There he sits
With corpse defiled
Lo That speech of which I hear
Of larks Nuthatches sky dwellers
Their intent made clear to me
Nothing stands obscured
Vigorous desires
By the way of gold
Witches plight to unfold
Rapacious nature
Shameless greed
All deplore her vanity
They smote the witch
With their lances fierce
They cast her to the fire
They looked on in disbelief
As she arose up from the pyre
From the embers renewed
With a mastery of spells
Thrice burnt and thrice reborn
This witch you cannot burn
When the embers fade
Mothers caught in her gaze
Winds of the end times swell
Begin the pilgrimage to Hel
She danced around fire
In an old cloistered grove
The forest her temple
The trees pierce the night sky
Black spires against silver light
The gods they all love her
They bestowed upon her the dawn
Birds circle above her
The wolf heeds to her call
Awaken in her embrace
Arms outstretched to the heavens
She sings of days of yore
She gives praise in the twilight
Upon an altar of stone
Reverence for olden lore
Lost out path lies buried in dust
Blindly we fall into the wilderness
A new era unchained from the past
Blindly we succumb to oblivion
Where do we go from here
We no longer hear her song
No longer does the wolf heed her call
The gods lay silent in the dawn
Emerge from the evening mist
Congregation with torches lit
A solemn path to stone filled shores
A ship awaits for the voyage home
Corpse in ceremonial form
With sword and shield adorned
Kinsmen silent in mourning
The ravens call resounding
From midst the tinder
Spark births rising flame
The horn sounds
In the distance
Its resonance
Beckons the fire
Orange glow reflecting endlessly
Upon the tides of an abysmal sea
Shimmering light
The end of an era
Drifting from this realm
In all its splendor
A beacon in black horizon
Return to the halls of your fathers
Drink to your glorious deeds
Sing songs of battle and honor
Reunite with the olden kings
The now distant fire has ceased
What remains is claimed by the sea
They lift their heads to the rising sun
The last shadow of night has gone
From the forest echoes the distant cries
Lo Lament for out chieftain died
A stone ship for our once great king
May it guide his way to the halls on high
Though his body will wither away
Up here in space
I'm looking down on you
My lasers trace
Everything you do
You think you've private lives
Think nothing of the kind
There is no true escape
I'm watching all the time
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Always in focus
You can't feel my stare
I zoom into you
You don't know I'm there
I take a pride in probing all your secret moves
My tearless retina takes pictures that can prove
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Electric eye in the sky
Feel my stare always there
There's nothing you can do about it
Develop and expose
I feed upon your every thought
And so my power grows
I'm made of metal
My circuits gleam
I am perpetual
I keep the country clean
I'm elected electric spy
I'm protected electric eye
Protected Detective Electric eye
Don't you know you're driving me insane
You're tryin' to find your way through life
You're tryin' to get some new direction
Another woman got her man
She won't find no new connection
You're tryin' to find your way again
You're tryin' to find some new
Another woman's got her man
But she won't find a new
You 'bin foolin' with some hot guy
I want to know why is it why
Get up get out you know you really blew it
Once she was wonderful
Once she was fine
Once she was beautiful
Once she was mineshe was mine
Changes changes changes changes
Victim of changes
Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine
Rides the Metal Monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas
Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Faster than a laser bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns
Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave
With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies
He is the Painkiller
This is the Painkiller
Wings of steel Painkiller
Deadly wheels Painkiller
Wrapped tight around me
Like a second flesh hot skin
Cling to my body
As the ecstasy begins
Your wild vibrations
Got me shooting from the hip
Crazed and insatiable let rip
Eat me alive
Sounds like an animal
Panting to the beat
Groan in the pleasure zone
Gasping from the heat
Gutwrenching frenzy
That deranges every joint
I'm gonna force you at gun point
To eat me alive
Bound to deliver as
You give and I collect
Squealing impassioned as
The rod of steel injects
Lunge to the maximum
Spreadeagled to the wall
You're well equipped to take it all
So eat me alive
Hypnotise me
Mesmerise me
Feel my willpower slip
Light my fire
With cold desire
Losing all my grip
Eat my diamonds
Drinking all my gin
Feast your eyes on
A whole lotta sin
Oh no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
Took my dreams
And now it's seems you're nothing but a liar
Smash and grab at all I had
Build my funeral pyre
Stop pretendin'
Got me growin' old
Your tormentin's
Fit to snap my soul
Oh no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
You took my heart
And left it blown to smithereens
I gave my body as a slave
You cut my flesh
And drank my blood that poured in streams
I'm left here broken and ashamed
Goin' under
Hear the thunder
Death defying grace
Your condition breeds ammunition
Shoots me in the face
Vicious talkin'
Stabs me like a knife
Scratched and bruised so abused
I'm a human sacrifice
Oh no you're so damned wicked
You got me by the throat
Oh no gotcha claws stuck in me
You never let me go
I believe you're the devil
I believe you're the devil's child
Grand canyons of space and time universal
My mind is subjected to all
Stab Bawl Punch Crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab Bawl Punch Crawl
I know what I am I'm Berlin
I face the impregnable wall
Stab Bawl Punch Crawl
Hooks to my brain are well in
Stab Bawl Punch Crawl
I know what I am I'm Berlin
Exploding reloading this quest never ending
Until I give out my last breath
Hooks to my brain are well in
I know what I am I'm Berlin
Feeling like we're ready to kick tonight
No hesitating my bodies aching
Looking for some action satisfaction all right
Mega town Leviathan we're ready to hit the roof
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Delivering the goods
Delivering the goods
Stealing your hearts all across the land
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Delivering the goods
Yeah Delivering the goods
Have your way
Stealing your hearts
The bound to do most damage to your brain
If you're looking for it mellow
You're nothing more than yellow
Gonna do it again and again
We'll beat you to submission
So you might as well surrender
You do gotta learn your lesson
Faster higher
'Til it seems that we're gonna break
Weaving with your heads
Crushed out on the floor
Begging for mercy
Be careful or we'll do it some more
You better watch out and hold on tight
We're heading your way like dynamite
Delivering the goods
Delivering the goods
Racing' cross the heavens
Straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet
Slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon
Blazing to the land
Now he's here amongst us
The age of fire's at hand
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for ExciterSalvation bids to ask
Everything he touches
Fries into a crisp
Let him get close to you
So you're in his trip
First you'll smoke and smoulder
Blister up and singe
When ignition hits you
the very soul of your being will cringe
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man
Where is he from
Exciter comes
For everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
He's come to make you snap out
Of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you
See the light again
So much selfindulgence
Results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency
Leads to beguiling lies
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
When he leaps amidst us
With combustive dance
All shall bear the branding
Of his thermal lance
Cauterising masses
Melting into one
Only when there's order
Will his job be done
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man
Where is he from
Exciter comes
For everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
Racing past the heavens
Straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet
Slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon
Blazing to the land
Now he's here amongst us
The age of fire's at hand
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
So much for the golden future I can't even start
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
You don't know what it's like
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law breaking the law
Breaking the law
Seek him here seek him on the highway
Never knowing when he'll appear
All await engine's ticking over
Hear the roar as they sense the fear
Wheels A glint of steel and a flash of light
Screams From a streak of fire as he strikes
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Black as night faster than a shadow
Crimson flare from a raging sun
An exhibition of sheer precision
Yet no one knows from where he comes
Fools Self destruct cannot take that crown
Dreams Crash one by one to the ground
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
But they didn't last and they died as they tried
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
Hell bent hell bent for leather
As the sun goes down I move around
Keeping to the shadows
Life hangs by a thread
If that's my destiny it'll have to be
So I'll face the future
Running out of time
I'm on the line
But I'll go down fighting
Felt the hand of justice
Telling wrong from right
Cybernetic heartbeat
Digital precise
Pneumatic fingers nearly had me in their vice
Not begging you
I'm telling you
You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me
Under blood red skies
You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies
Through a shattered city watched by laser eyes
Overhead the night squad glides
The decaying paradise
Automatic sniper
With computer sights
They're closing in
They'll never win
You won't break me
You won't take me
You won't make me
Under blood red skies
You won't break me
You won't take me
I'll fight you under
blood red skies
As the end is drawing near
Standing proud I won't give in to fear
As I die a legend will be born
I will stand I will fight
You'll never take me alive
I'll stand my ground
I won't go down
You won't break me
You won't make me
You won't take me
Under blood red skies
You won't break me
You won't take me
just I'll face you under
blood red skies
You'll never take me alive
I'm telling you
Hands of justice
I will stand I will fight
Never surrender
As the sun goes down
I won't give in to fear
We've taken too much for granted
And all the time it had grown
From techno seeds we first planted
Evolved a mind of its own
Marching in the streets
Dragging iron feet
Laser beaming hearts
Ripping men apart
From off I've seen my perfection
Where we could do as we please
In secrecy this infection
Was spreading like a disease
Hiding underground
Knowing we'd be found
Fearing for our lives
Reaped by robot's scythes
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Metal Gods
Machines are taking all over
With mankind in their command
In time they'd like to discover
How they can make their demand
Better be the slaves
To their wicked ways
But meeting with our death
Engulfed in molten breath
Before the dawn I hear you whisper
In your sleep Don't let the morning take him
Outside the birds begin to call
As if to summon up my leaving
It's been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
I've waited too long and now you're leaving
Oh please don't take it all away
It's been a lifetime since I found someone
Since I found someone who would stay
I've waited too long and now you're leaving
Oh please don't take it all away
Before the dawn I hear you whisper
In your sleep Don't let the morning take him
You won't hear me But you'll feel me
Without warning something's dawning listen
Then within your senses
You'll know you're defenceless
How your heart beats when you run for cover
Your cant retreat I spy like no other
Then we race together We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower driving into fury
Changing gear I pull you tighter to me
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
Love machines in harmony we hear the engines cry
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
Raise the sights the city lights are calling
In the street is where we'll meet we're warning
On the beat we won't retreat beware
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Bodies revvin' in leather heaven in wonder
Hell breaks loose turn on the juice get stronger
We metal maniacs begin to rave
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Shout it out we're all together now
Shout it out we join as one one
Thousand of cars and a million guitars
Screaming with power in the air
We've found the place where the decibels race
This army of rock will be there
To ram it down ram it down
Straight through the heart of this town
Ram it down ram it down
Razing the place to the ground
Ram it down
Something's calling
In the night
Electric madness
Roars in sight
Heat is rising
Blazing fast
Hot and evil
Feel the blast
Out of control
About to explode

Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown

Here comes the Metal Meltdown
Run for your lives
Can't stop the Metal Meltdown
Noone survives
Temperature is boiling
Magnifying might
Feeding like a virus
Flashing light
Imminent collision
Shockwaves all around
Generating energy
Screams so loud
It's comin'  Meltdown
Start runnin'  Countdown
Hey listen don't you let 'em get your mind
Fill your brain with orders and that's not right
They're playing at a game that draws you closer
Always takin' baby out that's ok
Told you once you're never gonna win the race
Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face
We are screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
Tie a blindfold all around your head
Spin you round in the torture before the dread
Then they lead you out into the final slaughter
As the sweat is running down your neck
Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode
Got to fight the horror of this mental load
We are screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
So you wait it out and bide your time
Everyone who wins in the great escape
Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake
I don't talk about it but that's all right
Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight
If it takes forever babe I tell ya' I can wait
We are screaming for vengeance
The world is a manacled place
Screaming screaming for vengeance
The world is defiled in disgrace
One life I'm gonna live it up
I'm takin' flight I said I'll never get enough
Stand tall I'm young and kinda proud
I'm on top as long as the music's loud
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
That's right here's where the talkin' ends
Drive hard I'm callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down on the rocks
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You got another thing comin'
Oh so hot no time to take a rest yeah
At top aint room for second best
Real strong got me some security
Hey I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah
Out there is a fortune waitin' to be had
You think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
He had enough
He couldn't take anymore
He'd found a place
In his mind and slammed the door
No matter how they tried
They couldn't understand
They washed and dressed him
Fed him by hand
Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you
Withdrawn he'd sit there
Stare blank into space
No sign of life
Would flicker on his face
Until one day he smiled
It seemed as though with pride
The wind kissed him
Goodbye  and then he died
Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for livin' in
Yeah I will start again
It can take forever and ever and ever
And ever but I'll still win
How many like him
Are there still
But to us all
Seem to have lost the will
They lie in thousands
Plagued and lost
Is nothing worth this bitter cost
Yeah I've left the world behind
I'm safe here in my mind
Free to speak with my own kind
This is my life this is my life
I'll decide not you
Keep the world with all its sin
It's not fit for livin' in
Beyond the realms of death
Golden halos radiating higher
Diamond visions softly breathing fire
Sky processions we are watching you arrive
Silver crystals arching beams below
What light spirals lifting up to go
Glass formations solar angels spread their wings
Spectral gliders drifting in the air
Wheels of wonder floating everywhere
Draped in rainbows gently we ascend
I've been trying
There's no denying
It's sending me
Out of my mind
I've seen reason
Change to treason
It's losing it's sense
Of all kind
How much longer will it take
For the world to see
We should learn to live
And simply let it be
Bloodstone bloodstone
In the night time
Wake in fright
I'm so scared of the game
That's being played
Start to wonder
What's going under
And how many deals
Have been made
How much longer will it take
For the world to see
We should learn to live
And simply let it be
Bloodstone bloodstone
Bloodstone
I can't take it
You got me living
On a bloodstone
I don't want that that bloodstone
Full moon is rising
The sky is black
I need your call I'm coming back
The road is straight cast
Wind's in my eyes
The engine roars between my thighs
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
Wild mountain thunder
Echoes my quest
My body aches but I'll not rest
Quartz light to guide me
Till sunrise leads
My passion screams my heart it bleeds
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
Then in the distance
I see you stand
On the horizon you raise your hand
In burning rubber
I end my quest
You fall into my arms at last
From desert plains I bring you love
From desert plains I bring you love
I'm gonna breakout
I'm gonna drive my car
I'm gonna get up and go
I want some action
I've been working so hard
I'm gonna over load
Can you feel the beat
Everybody's rockin' in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your temperature rise
For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
I'm feeling good tonight
I'm gonna cruise around
Makin' every head turn
Wind up the radio
I'm in the mood for some lovin'
Cause the night time's comin'
Can you feel the beat
Everybody's rockin' in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your temperature rise
For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Come on
Gettin' hot tonight
Come on
That's right
Come on
There's no end in sight
Come on
Alright
I'm gonna breakout
I'm gonna drive my car
I'm gonna get up and go
I want some action
I've been working so hard
I'm gonna over load
Can you feel the beat
Everybody's rockin' in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your temperature rise
For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Well I've said it before and I'll say it again
You get nothin' for nothin' expect it when
It's easy to go along with the crowd
And find later on that your say ain't allowed
So I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothin' to lose at all
I'm goin' to do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall
You can hang in a left or hang in a right
The choice it is yours to do as you might
The road is open wide to place your biddin'
Now wherever you turn wherever you go
If you get it wrong at least you can know
There's miles and miles to put it back together
And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothin' to lose at all
I'm goin' to do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall
Makin' a curve or takin' the strain
On the decline or out on the wane
Oh everybody breaks down sooner or later
We'll put it to rights we'll square up and mend
Back on your feet to take the next bend
You weather every storm that's comin' at 'tcha
And I'm heading out to the highway
I got nothin' to lose at all
I'm goin' to do it my way
Take a chance before I fall
A chance before I fall
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
I took the city 'bout one AM loaded loaded
I'm all geared up to score again loaded loaded
I come alive in the neon light
That's when I make my moves right
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
Ready to take on every deal loaded loaded
My pulse is racing I'm hot to take
This motor's revved up fit to break
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
I'm aiming for ya
I'm gonna floor ya
My body's coming
All night long
The air's electric sparkin' power loaded loaded
I'm getting hotter by the hour loaded loaded
I set my sights and then home in
The joint starts flying when I begin
Living after midnight rockin' to the dawn
Lovin' 'til the morning then I'm gone I'm gone
You mesmerise slowly
Till I can't believe my eyes
Ecstasy controls me
What you give just serves me right
Without warning you're here
Like magic you appear
I taste the fear
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Aroused with desire
You put me in a trance
A vision of fire
I never had a chance
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
In the night
Come to me
You know I want your Touch of Evil
In the night
Please set me free
I can't resist a Touch of Evil
Arousing me now with a sense of desire
Possessing my soul till my body's on fire
A dark angel of sin
Preying deep from within
Come take me in
I'm so afraid
But I still feed the flame
You're possessing me
From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone
Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
At every wind what a stake we're in
Is pain better than the grave
When we talk without amend
We see red and then
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
We begin to shake with rage
In the last rays of the setting sun
And the past days that's where our memories run
And all of those times
Still race through my mind
I'm shattered inside to find
When the night comes down
And I'm here all alone
When the night comes down
And there's no place to go
Call me and I'll wait till the summer
You never understood
Call me and I'll wait forever
For a love that's only good
As the light starts to dim
The fear closes in
And the nightmares begin
Oh no you won't be there tomorrow
Oh no say it isn't true
Can't take this pain and sorrow
Oh can't you see my heart is broken in two
Sinner rider rides in with the storm
The devil rides beside him
The devil is his god God help you mourn
Do you do you hear it do you hear the thunder
Deafen every living thing about
Can you can you see it can you
See the mountains darken yonder
Black sun rising time is running out
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Sinner
Sinner
Sinner
Sinner
His steed of fury
Eyes of fire and mane ablaze
Demonic vultures stalking
Drawn by the smell of war and pain
He roams the starways
Searching for the carcasses of war
But if it's hungry then its very presence
Disrupts the calm into the storm
Sinner
Sinner
Sinner
Sinner
God of the Devils God of the Devils
Won't you help them pray
God of the Devils God of the Devils
Is there no other way
Thirty years now sleeping so sound
War raises its head and looks slowly around
The Sinner is near sensing the fear
And the beast will start movin' around
Sinner
Sinner
Sinner
Sinner
Sacrifice to vice or die by the hand of the
Sinner
Fast and furious
We ride the universe
To carve a road for us
That slices every curve in sight
We accelerate
No time to hesitate
This load will detonate
Whoever would
Contend its right
Born to lead
At breakneck speed
With high octane
We're spitting flames
Freewheel burning
On we catapult
Go headlong into any dare
We don't accept defeat
We never will retreat
We blaze with scorching heat
Obliteration's everywhere
Look before you leap
Has never been the way we keep
Our road is free
Charging to the top
And never give in never stops
The Way to be
Hold on to the lead
With all your will and concede
You'll find there's life
With victory on high
Freewheel Burning
Howling winds keep screaming round
And the rain comes pouring down
Doors are locked and bolted now
As the thing crawls into town
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
Sanctuary is being sought
Whispered prayers a last resort
Homing in its' cry distorts
Terror struck they know they're caught
Straight out of hell
One of a kind
Stalking his victim
Don't look behind you
Nightcrawler
Beware the beast in black
Nightcrawler
You know he's coming back
Night Crawler
As night is falling
The end is drawing near
They'll hear
Their last rites echo on the wind
Huddled in the cellar
Fear caught in their eyes
Daring not to move or breathe
As the creature cries
Fingernails start scratching
On the outside wall
Clawing at the windows
Come to me it calls
Atmosphere's electric
As it now descend the stairs
Hiding in the darkness
Is so futile from its glare
Death comes in an instant
As they hoped it would
Souls ascend to heaven
I'll give you nothing nothing for free
You crossed the darkside you sold your soul
No turning back now you've dug your hole
Out of the darkness into the black
Out of the darkness into the black
You have the power inside your mind
To make a difference to all mankind
Your time is ticking you beat your drum
They criticize you what you've become
Out of the darkness into the black
Out of the darkness into the hahahahaha
Can you be what you wanna be
Can you forget the past
Are you all that you oughta be
Take you into the black
Can you be what you wanna be
Can you forget the past
Are you all that you oughta be
Take you into the black
You make decisions you must decide
The force of evil you can't deny
The truth is out there you force your hand
You must believe it to make a stand
Out of the darkness into the black
Out of the darkness into the black
Sound of bombs runs through the air
In the streets of Lebanon
Hate filled soldiers everywhere
The troops of Babylon
Bloodstains on the footpath
Madness on the ground
Senseless forms of bloodbath
As you hear the bugles sound
Dodging the machine gun fire
Fighting for their lives
Killing with their hearts desire
No one can survive
The battle of Lebanon  a killer
The battle of Lebanon  destruction
Trenches filled with Muslim guards
Rifles set to fire
Left the enemy battle scarred
Terrorist guns for hire
Send out the kamikazes on a suicide attack
Take the war of Lebanon to masochistic heights
Massacre and bloodshed are just a part of war
Aerial destruction and submarines below
Shooting guided missiles to give the final blow
I fear no foe I have no fear
See me laughing when death comes near
Pain is sweet and life is cold
There's no repenting when you grow old
I seek revenge my master's hell
Crumbled ruins as his kingdom fell
Must take your life to set me free
Turn your back on immortality
I am Immortal got no right to die
I am Immortal no one can deny
I am Immortal 'til the end of time
I am Immortal
I have no guilt there is no law
My blackened heart's rotting at the core
Break the rules a crying shame
Nothing matters 'cos it's just a game
Take your aim the life you choose
Just one chance if you win or lose
Fight 'til death the battle is won
Revenge is mine the superior one
I am Immortal got no right to die
I am Immortal no one can deny
I am Immortal 'til the end of time
I am Immortal
Take you chances if you dare
Time will break your evil stare
Legend says it's you or I
Destroy the myth and you will die
See the sound of slashing swords
Piercing through your heart
The screaming of the civil lords
Wash away the weeping wounds tearing you apart
The weaving of the evil hordes
The Master will scorn you he'll even forlorn you
He'll give you a price to pay
Have mercy you bastard take your soul away
Trapped into a terror state
Forget about your future fate
He gave you the price to pay
Revenge has been won and a new life begun
'Cos I am immortal
Mayhemic destruction death's the call
Crushing with abduction wants to kill them all
Eternal devastation oozing with pain
Manifestation live for Satan's reign
Mayhemic destruction
Total distortion blood from your ears
Living with abortion memories disappear
Facing your destiny living just to die
Christian immunity reaching for the sky
Mayhemic destruction
People fleeing cause they're scared
Yet no place to go
Fire and brimstone in your blood
Fuck who told you so
Take your heart send it down to a firey death
You were warned of this
Your unholy book
Devouring vermin destroy a corpse
Dare you take a look
Armageddon went too far
What is left of life
Pity up there in heaven
You missed your cut of a knife
Slaughtered and ripped out of the tomb
Vicious acts horrid deeds
Diggig up corpses newly entombed
This is where he feeds
Sadistic maniac bloodsoaked feast
He comes here every night
To stalk the cemetery's new dug graves
And make sure there's no one in sight
A lust of the wicked lust for the vile
Repeating unspeakable acts
Obscene and atrocious lacking remorse
Skulls of the humans now cracked
Beyond the living beneath the dead
They will rot in pieces
Beyond the living beneath the dead
They will rot in pieces
This murderous butcher with sinister intent
Can't resist his nocturnal urge
To haunt the graveyard for new to maim
A brutal and repugnant search
Sadistic maniac bloodsoaked feast
He comes here every night
To stalk the cemetery's new dug graves
And make sure there's no one in sight
Beyond the living beneath the dead
They will rot in pieces
Beyond the living beneath the dead
They will rot in pieces
Rot in pieces  dead
Mad butcher I sharpen my knife
My sole purpose is to drain lives
At my house in the basement below
I've got three people hidden they can't say no
Bound and gaggedto avoid that they'll flee
I find pleasure in murdering three
Pure carnal lust
Makes me feel alive
Carved to the bone
Slit the jugular and let it flood
The best method for emptying them of blood
Then I cut their flesh right to the bone
This is the part where my addiction has grown
I keep their flesh in my freezer to eat
Nothing's better than tender human meat
It's what I crave and more I'll taste
A constant hunger for human waste
I snatch my victims when they come to me
Invite them in and set my madness free
I take my favorite knife with sharp steel
And hang 'em up by their heels
Pure carnal lust
Makes me feel alive
Carved to the bone
Murderer killer a sinister fiend
I have no remorse for my wicked deeds
With morbid intent I aim for the head
Unleashing the hammer I want you dead
Pounding and slamming my hammer of doom
I won't stop 'til I've bloodsoaked the room
Bloodhammer Pounding of doom
Bloodhammer Morbid kills
Bludgeoning out of control
a relentless beating
My favourite choice of weapon
I like the repeating
I want it to look like a dozen were slayed
like a massacre took place
To show my constant disgust for mankind
and the whole human race
Bloodhammer Pounding of doom
Bloodhammer Morbid kills
Bloodhammer Hammer of doom
Destructive force Into the dead
Obliteration annihilation mass destruction
Hammering painstaking a lethal swing
So malicious and atrocious raw and vicious
Brutalize pulverise a quick demise
I kill your face breaking your bones
Samshing your skull pounding your flesh
Cold heavy steel in my hand swinging in wrath
I am on a neverending unstoppable murderous path
Bloodhammer Pounding of doom
Bloodhammer Morbid kills
Bloodhammer Hammer of doom
Destructive force Into the dead
Morbid ways foul decay
Wicked and deranged
They are always asking for it
In this chopping pit
Sadistic ways foul dismay
I decapite and maim
Bloodsoaked brutal deeds
On their blood I feed
Dismemberment like an ever flowing stream
Of blood I am not what I seem
I take their heads in frantic wrath
Entombed they'll be on my killing path
I hack in violent ecstasy  raging death
On this day of lunacy  your last breath
Fanatic and insan  pure evil hate
I live for their pain
Headless dawn
Blood will flow
Bloodred dawn
Heads will roll
Headless dawn
This is what I do I'll never quit
Into the grave bit by bit
Headless dawn
Daily terror torture without end
Infernal malice spit and offend
Stack 'em up a hideous pile
Prepare the satisfaction with acts so vile
Infernal horror pain without end
Men and women all must attend
Deadly poison coming from an opening
Slowly permeating death it will bring
Sinister torture
Cadaverous stench
Sinister death
A pile of flesh
Hidden chambers specially built for me
Inhaling poison never to be free
Malicious cause that no one can abide
No escaping this crawling death called pesticide
Sinister torture
Cadaverous stench
Sinister death
A pile of flesh
Inside these walls survival isn't optional
Every breath is merely chemical
Scratching the doors fighting for air
Screaming for mercy which isn't there
Death in the air death in the ground
Lifeless eyes staring in the dark
This eerie night this freezing night
Where evil has left it's mark
Beyond the damned
I'll soon be one of them
Beyond the damned
Cemetery malice alive tonight
Haunted graves invisible guests
Beneath the ground where evil lurks
Where mist and stench infest
Beyond the damned
I'll soon be one of them
Beyond the damned
Descend to the beyond
Away from the tomb
Feeling no pain
Drowned in my own flesh
Drained from blood
Rotten and cold
I come here at least once a week
And lie next to the ones that reek
Open caskets filled to the brim
I like to study them from limb to limb
Beyond the damned
I'll soon be one of them
Beyond the damned
Descend to the beyond
Away from the tomb
Feeling no pain
Drowned in my own flesh
Drained from blood
Rotten and cold
Descend to the beyond
Away from the tomb
Feeling no pain
Drowned in my own flesh
Drained from blood
Rotten and cold
To mankind we're an enemy sworn
Evil madness since we were born
Formed an army a militia of blood
To bring humanity back into mud
In the night through the mist we appear
An inmense legion you tremble with fear
With hatred and anger we fight
One thousand deaths on this unholy night
Death league
Thirsty for blood
In league with death
Thrown in the flood
Death league
Slaughtered and torn
In leaque with death
In hell reborn
In the darkest abyss
Beyond the rotting world
The demons of death arise
Everything is doomed tohell
Bludgeonous slaughters blood we'll spill
It's all about how many people we kill
Cursed to an eternal fall
Obsessed by cruelty death to all
Night of scorn the final hour
The darkness is ours to devour
Death league
Our only goal
is to depopulate the earth
Because mankind
is simply without worth
Burn it all burn it to the ground
Until nothing but dust is to be found
Kill 'em all and all shall see
We are the essence of grotesquery
Death league
Thirsty for blood
In league with death
Thrown in the flood
Death league
Slaughtered and torn
In leaque with death
In hell reborn
A blow to the head unconsciousness
Soon to be in deaths caress
You're worthless your life I will drain
A constant desire to inflict pain
Shackled in chains
Dragged in pain
Buried alive
Below you die
I tie you up and shackle your hands
When you're conscious
you'll obey my commands
Entangled in chains declare me as god
You scream as I drag you through the mud
Life is pouring out of you
soon you'll be gone
Relentless torture
you'll be dead by dawn
Your wrists are bleeding
from the sharp cold steel
Hoping that it's all a dream
but it's for real
Life is pouring out of you
soon you'll be gone
Relentless torture
you'll be dead by dawn
I roll you down in a newly dug grave
An alive burial as I fill the grave again
You're gasping for air but it's all in vain
Shackled in chains
Dragged in pain
Buried alive
Below you die
Strapped to the floor
Lying in gore
Being dismembered and torn
Cuts my skin
Pale white and thin
With streams of red I'm being fed
I am defleshed
The ultimate fear
Longing for death
I am defleshed
He peels off my skin
With a sinister grin
Defleshed to the bone
Dead within
My eyelids are cut
I can't get them shut
Screaming in fear
As death draws near
Death is now here
In the black cloak of night they arrive
A secret coven a congregation of the dead
Born from the dark that keeps the alive
Why they're summoned remains unsaid
Into the darkness
where light does not reach
A thick fog is coming near
Only the eerie moonlight the beseech
Born from evil born without fear
Voices from the grave
Shadows from beyond
Rise from beneath
To terrify the night
Voices from the grave  the cemetery horrors
Shadows from beyond  the cemetery mist
Rise from beneath  the cemetery horrors
To terrify the night  the cemetery fright
Graves dug up caskets unveiled
The dead is awakened on this night
From their mouths evil is exhaled
A shapeless essence a wretched fright
The souls of the dead are gathering here
Entwined in a vortex of screams
Lurking now beyond death beyond fear
Nothing is what it seems
Darkness is complete
Oh so it burns
Dark endless forests
Has poisoned my blood
Overshadowed by ancient evil
My bones are black from sadness
My soul is cold as ice
I will dwell in hell
Dark endless forests
From another age
Darkness it shall be
Not a sign of light
No heaven so bright
But hell burned a light
Souls screaming out loud
Let us fucking die
Dark endless forests
From another age
Darkness it shall be
Not a sign of light
Blackened stars fall from the sky
To rule again in satan's empire
Father  I'm your seed
We are bound by human sins
Finally the last ray of light slowly disappears
I'll come for you you'll pay us with your life
I will bring new law
I will bring new law
New tomorrow burn in fire
I will bring new law
I will bring new law
None of us will hide again
I hear them calling my name ritual has begun
Prophecy Fulfill tonight Evil ones must die
Black beast will possess your souls hell awaits
Now I close my eyes
Let myself go to find the strength in my soul
Now you close your eyes
You're done forever gone
This war lasted for way too long
Too much torture and minds in control
How could you place so many lies
In every drop of innocent blood
Out of the darkness is coming my strength
There's always someone who's watching my back
Perceptible only with my senses
I fear no evil nor the liars' reigns
My best companions are demons and friends
They're like a touch of hidden dimensions
Illuminated they come out of flames
and call my name
Dreams of fire night after night
Flaming bursting my peace of mind
Voices calling inside my head
Am I insane or maybe damned
Dreams of fire
When I want something I don't need to tell
I make a gesture  You'll get it for me
You can't resist my powerful behests
There are no rivers that I couldn't cross
Of highest mountains I reach every top
Reality Or I'm only dreaming
I hear the howling it happens again
They call my name
Crimson shade covers the ground
Time to take off golden crown
Gone another day
Fiery eyes upon the sky
Moon is dancing with the dusk
Night has come again
Forbidden lore from my wishful dreams
Showed me how I shall create new rules
Forbidden books knowledge so unreal
Every word shortens path reveals the truth
Angel falls
And the sun goes down
Bring the light
Brighten up my mind
So now I understand
Mystic forces prevail
Oh when the sun goes goes down
Surrounded by fire's light
He will take out of my mind
Past and future fears
Too little time so much to learn
Command time to stop ans wait
From this chalice I will drink
Potion made of human fears
It's flavored with his own tears
Our future is in my hands
I'm lost in strife lies stand in my way
I'm filled with doubts
Torn and desperate is my heart
I crave to show who I really am inside
You'll see my smile  inside I'm crying
Tightly chained by wreaking havoc on my heart
I still myself pull all the strings of my life
Oh trapped alone behind the curtain of lies
Oh wing of innocence are broken  won't fly
I wear a mask they think they know me
But it's not me I just want to run away
I show them face they want to see I survive
Feeling I must not show
My mind drowns in tears of sorrow
Maze of doubts sealed my fate
Caged by lies until my end
There are no tears I feel no sadness
Where they have gone
They are hiding deep inside
I try to act like all is fine  it's my fight
My will is free
I have no god no master
Truth is my name
I hold no grudge nor anger
I kneel to no one
I walk alone
Although I'm still surrounded
By howls of winds
By screams of shattered lighting
You can hear my name
Among the damned
Always out of line
Always out of line
Leave your fears and doubts behind
Do or die
Fight for your rights
Do not approve submission
reach for the top
You don't need their permission
Never look behind
No time to waste
Get rid of hesitations
Be strong and don't listen
to their suggestions
Now make up your mind
And get things done
So good at bluffing are people all around
So terrifying they try to break us down
They are like tyrants blind for the future finds
They say we're evil with no right to survive
It's not too late
This is not over
That's our price for being free
Burn my fire Burn
War with wisdom Let it be
Burn my fire Burn
Science  my armor knowledge  my shiny knife
Courage  my anchor that keeps me still alive
One day they will listen to what we want to say
They want to control and possess our minds
But for them it's too late
It's over
Everything is coated with ice of their lies
There still hope so strong in our hearts
Don't lose it because the right moment will come
It will set our fire  Don't let it die
I'm not dreaming and my eyes are wide open
What we do this night will never be forgotten
End of evil
End of lies
End of evil
Flames and blood
Shadows from the mist looming up and surround me
Hear the howling The sin eaters are hungry
I will heal our world with a ritual of fire
This is our night
End of lies
No more crimes
Could you please tell me how to forget the past
Those I love are now gone
I'm standing here between two worlds
Should I give them one last chance
Hope will never die  I can make it stay forever
Hope will never die  I can make it stay forever
Everything is said and done
Evil won't survive
Never I don't know how I could live with that
Oh no I don't believe
That cruelty can just disappear
We all hope for new life without fear
In freedom's light
Strength is growing in our hearts
No more lies only truth
No one will tell us what to do
Final words I'll decide
We will get back our lives
Altogether we will rise
Don't say you are sorry because it's too late
No more deadly tortures no more killing lies
There are no feelings you recall just hate
I rise from the fire
I think I know how weird this is for you
Tonight you're alone tonight you will lose
I am your nightmare this night is your doom
I rise from the fire
In its flames you are gone
I rise from the fire
I'll rule forevermore
You forced me to reveal my evil side
My heart was pure and honest
You made me who I am
Too late for regrets what happened is done
I've got something for you severe punishment
You won't get any chance to repent
Feel my resentment descent upon you
See you in hell
Can I make you an offer You can't refuse
And I will take you to the very gates of Hell
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell oh yeah see you in Hell
Your choice's up then how many sins can be yours
At my kingdom final choice is yours
You can take it any time that you need
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
I'll see you in Hell
See you in Hell my friend
See you in Hell my friend
This Heart of Fire is burning proud
I am every dream you lost and never found
This Heart of Fire is stronger now
Build your walls but you can't keep me out
I'll burn them down
This Heart of Fire is burning proud
I am every dream you lost and never found
This Heart of Fire is stronger now
Built your walls but you can't keep me out
Let's burn it down
Behold the new hate with all the same
Lost values
Forsake what lives deeper
In death we're all believers
Raised up your sirens
Break through the silence
We are united in the seach of
Something more
Cross your heart
Open you mind
Hide your face in their disguise
Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the sun
But I will never be the faithless one
No I will never be the faithless one
Refuse to destroy
The altars we are serving
The truth in living
Is that our souls are seaching
Live with defiance
It's time to fight
Don't ever let them keep your words
From being heard
Cross your heart
Open your mind
Hide your face in their disguise
Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the sun
But I will never be the faithless one
No I will never be the faithless one
Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I don't wanna look up to the sun
But I will never be the faithless one
Even when I fall down to my knees
I never say a prayer I don't believe
And I will never look up to the sun
But now I wanna be the faithless one
No I will never be the faithless one
But I will never be the faithless one
We are created the suffering ones
Condemned by the dying
We sing out in tongues
Caught in obsession with all that we love
Never look forward just straight down the gun
I can't take it any more
Every day feels like a war
The Devil in the mirror
Screaming that my heart is flawed
I'm never gonna let you win
No I will not surrender
Even if I start to fall
I swear to you I'll rise again
Cast the illusions of hatred and pride
Take the communion in faith they provide
I'm just a human not ready to die
My voice is a weapon my fear is a lie
I can't take it anymore
Everyday feels like a war
The Devil in the mirror
Screaming that my heart is flawed
I'm never gonna let you win
No I will not surrender
Even if I start to fall
I swear to you I'll rise again
Heaven's gone the battle's won
I had to say goodbye
Lived and learned from every fable
Written by your mind
And I wonder how to move on
From all I had inside
Place my cards upon the table
In blood I draw the line
I've given all my pride
Living a life of misery
Always there just underneath
Haunting me quietly alone
Its killing me killing me
Dead and gone what's done is done
You were all I had become
I'm letting go of what I once believed
So goodbye agony
I watch the stars and setting suns
As the years are passing by
I never knew that hope was fatal
Until I looked it in the eye
And now I'm not sure I am able
To reach the other side
Casting out the light
Living a life of misery
Always there just underneath
Haunting me quietly alone
Its killing me killing me
Dead and gone what's done is done
You were all I had become
I'm letting go of what I once believed
So goodbye agony
Goodbye agony
Not alone in forgiving
The faithful and the blind
Innocence is forsaken
I leave 'em all behind
And then I see that even angels never die
Living a life of misery
Always there just underneath
Haunting me quietly alone
Its killing me killing me
Dead and gone what's done is done
You were all I had become
I'm letting go of what I once believed
So goodbye agony
Goodbye agony
Goodbye agony
We're faithful broken promises of the lies
The virtues beaten down into your empty eyes
A saint is not a weapon it's a message a message
A sermon of shame a demon that you want to blame
Pain is not a blessing it's a lesson a lesson
Don't bow down to a world of hate
From your cradle to the grave
And even if you take the side of lies over truth
Everyday the world will take what you give in to
A personal slave the one you left to die in vain
Faith becomes an addiction not ambition ambition
Don't bow down to a world of hate
From your cradle to the grave
Even if you sacrifice beliefs to get through
And even if you take the side of lies over truth
Everyday the world will take what you give in to
Hold on in a world of sacrifice
Hold on until your last breath is gone
Hold on in a world of sacrifice
Hold on until your last breath is gone
Children born and raised on a Sunday
Hearing what their leaders say
Singing along
A story missing to the ones who won't listen
All the words are left alone
But I've been running out
Fighting to stay above the line and
I can feel the Devil is close so
It's gonna follow me down
It's gonna follow me down Gonna follow
Last rites in a lost city
I can't fight for a life I've never known
Dark lights giving no pity
Last rites for a place I call my home
Fear is in the war for society
Hungry for the heresy
Never atone
A spark that glistens for the
Souls of a mission
Canonize this pile of stones
But I'm rebelling now
Fighting to save my only life and
I can feel the rapture is close so
It's gonna follow me down
It's gonna follow me down Gonna follow
Last rites in a lost city
I can't fight for a life I've never known
Dark lights giving no pity
Last rites for a place I call my home
For a place I call my home
For a place I call my home
Sanctus
Dominus
I am left alone
Last rites in a lost city
I can't fight for a life I've never known
Dark lights giving no pity
Last rites for a place I call my home
For a place I call my home
For a place I call my home
I see you lived illusions
Pictured life with your conclusions
I don't know how to tell you
This path has lost its value
With lies of shroud I walk
I suffer a loss of life
I am the social hero
Oh poor man in a time that's broken
I pray to the heroes of the damned
I sing with dull devotion
A song for the ones behind the mask
I can't feel false ideal
Another fool that's blind to what's real
I sing for the hopeless broken
They live for the stolen omen
I see this I know pain
Let's see you try aaaaah
You got me enter my mask
They awake the priest aaah
With lies of shroud I walk
I suffer a loss of life
I am the social hero
Oh poor man in a time that's broken
I pray to the heroes of the damned
I sing with dull devotion
A song for the ones behind the mask
I can't feel false ideal
Another fool that's blind to what's real
I sing for the hopeless broken
They live for the stolen omen
Time has taken love a darker side revealed
For every lie begins with what we used to feel
A lonely heart will mend until we know the truth
But if it stays the same can we make it through
A life without the hurt a life without you
Blame my sins under these chains livin' in pain
Everything's gone everything's gone
Blame my sins under these chains livin' in pain
Walk away everything's gone
Walk away everything's gone
Walk away
A life without you everything's gone
A life without you everything's gone
Drag me to the grave
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Feel the blade of a broken promise
Carvin' wounds in a waste of conscience
I alone have the will to fight it
Save my own demise
Another victim another viper
I can feel sins grippin' tighter
To the spirits that we die for
And I will never let it go
Risin' up I'm a fighter
Young and loud with desire
Heroes blessed by the fire
I won't let these demons
Drag me to the grave
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Drag me to the grave
Death is not from the depths of silence
Takin' life I have made so honest
I'm the world tearin' through this calm
Let's live another night
Feel the seasons changin' faster
Feel the reapers of disaster
And the spirits that we die for
And I will never let it go
Risin' up I'm a fighter
Young and loud with desire
Heroes blessed by the fire
Now I live just to conquer
All the pain around us creepin' forward
Reachin' out to
Drag me to the grave
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Drag me to the grave
Risin' up I'm a fighter
Young and loud with desire
Heroes blessed by the fire
I won't let these demons
Risin' up I'm a fighter
Young and loud with desire
Heroes blessed by the fire
I won't let these demons
Drag me to the grave
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Drag me to the grave
Drag me to the grave
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Woaaaah woah woah woah woah
Drag me to the grave
Failure and apathy descend
Success just hasn't been your friend
You live a lie high as the sky
This taste like iron blood and greed
Tell us of what you'll never be
I won't ask why just let it die
Sleeping tight in your insanity
The truth could remedy
You stole it all sold them your soul give it up
You are you are forever alone
Casting your stones give it up
You are you are the shattered god
I try with every ounce of hell
to pry you open from your shell
Twisting the knife
Regretting your life
Your eyes are empty like your bed
Somehow you haven't whelmed up dead
Chances passed by
You'll never fly
Singing hymns about the sins you see
But you'll never hear from me
You stole it all sold them your soul give it up
You are you are forever alone
Casting your stones give it up
You are you are the shattered god
Feel the embrace all of the hate
I have watched you fall
Finding your words sounding like silence
You've already set it all
You stole it all sold them your soul give it up
You are you are forever alone
Casting your stones give it up
You are you are the shattered god
Seven years have come and gone
All that's left are scriptures songs
Livin' with the pieces of my memory
Striving into your arms
With this crown of thorns
With my crown of thorns
And I watch you wonder who I had to be
Striving into your arms
With this crown of thorns
With my crown of thorns
Faith incumbent through the darkness
Sins of comin' we've become of
Striving into your arms
With this crown of thorns
With my crown of thorns
We are dust and bone a temple's made of stone
We have seen it all even watch our armies fall
We are mysteries secrets that they keep
When war begins we'll ride again
Tonight our chapter will begin
It's time to wash away the sins
And no one can deny we are the Sons of Night
We're driving faster through our pain
No more waiting for a change
Wear a mask of shame hiding all the pain
Courage hides the truth rubbing on the youth
Of the given rights heaven let the world ignite
When shadows crawl you're not alone
Tonight our chapter will begin
It's time to wash away the sins
And no one can deny we are the Sons of Night
We're driving faster through our pain
No more waiting for a change
Tonight our chapter will begin
It's time to wash away the sins
And no one can deny we are the Sons of Night
Tonight our chapter will begin
It's time to wash away the sins
And no one can deny we are the Sons of Night
We're driving faster through our pain
No more waiting for a change
No more excuses what are you running away from
Intoxicant platform you grow increasingly numb
At once you're so alive so alive 
No more excuses what are you running away from
Intoxicant platform you grow increasingly numb
You fallen off 
You fallen off 
Comin' back 
Comin' back

To arms o' warriors of the north
On our fathers' holy ground
an enemy against us
shan't be crowned but with his death
Those christians shall be expelled
On their pearly gates
they shall be baptised in their blood
You miserable weak proselytizers
who dare step onto our path
Be damned ye children of heaven
death eternal awaits
Now grasp your swords
We won't grant you a drop
Soon the ground shall turn red
and the blood flows
Die
Vanish from our ground never turn
suffer the measure you deserve
This decadent heir of the image of god
shall not usurp our land for devastation
The son of Jehovah deserves no honour
and when the flows of blood cease
you shall know that we have won
Dead is the halo
and no more shine surrounding them
One sword one lethal blow
thus did seal the victory
Freezing is the air
that is now embracing us
All the forests all the plains in the north
are grateful for their freedom
Icy fields are glittering
shooting forth the glare of blood
Lakes cast their shine through the skies
in this wintry kingdom
Through the hunting grounds of the gods
there wandered a child born into nature
I heard him cursing the days of the past
Everyone had gone let them blaze up
This is our path
to salvation
We defend the kingdom
of Mother Earth
The fates that we live for
forever bound to the flames of the sun
This is our path
to freedom
We defend the honour
of Mother Earth
The priceless lives of yours
breathless be buried under withered leaves
This is our path
our holy ground
We defend the kingdom
we defend the honour
Thus on our path
shall no blasphemer walk
We defend the creation
of Mother Earth
In the white shimmer of the moon
under the light of every star
enshrouded by azure and verdant
see him travel to emptiness
Onwards to the eternal
liberty of the wolves
In the blood of the vanquished
those tread on by the battle
but is our journey unending
Everywhere we may rest
Our resting place under the starlit sky
guarded with the power of thunder
whilst the clear waters are running free
in the streams on the thrones of green
Can you hear the wind gnawing the mountains
In the ice castles of winter it howls alone
The frost now unleashed soon shall us reach
when autumn turns to winter
Coldness knows no mercy
the frost does not stand aside ever
Can you feel the icy crust piercing through your
skin
burning you deep inside
that shall lay waste the tender sky
when the winter eternal arrives
Coldness knows no mercy
the frost does not stand aside ever
green is enshrouded by white
no summer you shall ever see only a sky ran pale
The hunger of the frost is growing
your heaven it enshrouds with fury
Coldness knows no mercy
the frost does not stand aside ever
Coldness knows no mercy
the frost never stands aside
Welcome the winter eternal
green enshrouded by white
All wings are cut and the resistance is broken
None of the angels shall survive
The sharp cutting frost is the victor
and snow shall veil the northern ground
Leaves are turning pale dying in lament
and the clouds are gathering to witness
'tis tumult of demons in the heart of winter
At last it's the reign of the eternal winter
a vain hope that it will end
Hear me
Children of the frost
Hear me
This winter is forever
Let the slaughter begin
Until the traitor's end
The blood of an enemy is pouring down the sword
Children of the prophet
For too long have you inhabited our lands
We do not need your savior
we do not need your lies
Whoever is unfettered no man can set him free
Nature is our mother
our altar on her bosom
The most sacred of ours dwell everywhere around
They are the gods we worship
and we will not forsake what's ours
And you came up north so far from home
where you shall once again return
Death to the sheep who deprived us of our faith
Soon imploring for mercy with no escape in sight
Onwards to Tuonela
And the conqueror is gone
The blood of an enemy is pouring down the sword
Shed the blood death overcome
Sound the clash of iron pain overcome
Kill them all sow destruction
And desire will still burn breathe
Descends  unto the earth
Exhumes  the fresh graves
Corpses  are turned to slaves
He drains your blood and embalms you alive
Steals your soul as your body rots and dies
Mortuary  his morbid home
Cemetery  his creatures roam
Enter  your life will end
Creeping  spheres descend
Funeral's over the casket's closed
Your body starts to decompose
Remains are to be destroyed
Brought into the crematory
Enters  into your home
He comes  to take your soul
Mortician  you can't escape
Dead  you're in the hearse
Dismembered limbs
Severed spine
On your flesh
Maggots dine
Cut off head
Ripped out eyes
A bloody corpse
Unrecognized
Torn apart
Mangled flesh
You are left
A bloody mess
Enter to the graveyard
Walk among the tombstones
Smell the putrid stench of
Rotting flesh decayed bones
Unearthing a fresh grave
Open up the coffin
Hunger for flesh you crave
A feast you will begin
Show the dead no remorse
Rip out all the brains
Mortify the helpless corpse
Eat all the fucking remains
Hunger not satisfied
Still you crave for more flesh
Torn apart the corpse lies
where i lay awake beneath cupid's curse
tasting this decay
brought by another day
words taste of death
her words taste of death
lingering in my head
sent to kill
I'm still alive
my heart still bleeds 
my eyes turn to grey
stars burn out one by one
my dreams burn out one by one
as these rose pedals peel
she loves me
she loves me not
I won't love you this time
I see your face shining in my tears
bleeding through my skin
my wrists are cut away
I won't be able to look you in the eyes
I won't be able to smile
tonight the stars are gonna shine on my corpse
I want the face of an angel
my corpse is gonna shine tonight
with all the stars in your eyes
you won't see
you don't see me
I've wasted myself on you
all that was green has withered to nothing
a blackened sky suffocates me
where is my rainbow
where are my flowers
the roses have all turned black
my heart withers as the autumn leaves
it's so much easier to watch them die
I want to watch you die
all that I know
all that I love
all that I long for
you'll just kill me in the end
my summer grows cold
I try to resurrect your face with my breath
I can taste the salt of my own tears
I couldn't reach you
tomorrow holds no hope
the sun has set for good
passion is a distant memory
leave me to die
leave me to die with the seasons
intrigued
how could this be
such a residual process
fountains of hope fraught with despair
look away children
look away
his beauty hidden deep in fraud
plagued
plagued by mockery
affluent in nothing
how I long to be complete
with you I am
I am you
released
my will has been put to death
I am nowhere
I am nowhere but everywhere
casually remind me pointless instruction
look away children
look away
I will look nevermore
I see
my darling
you're an angel
you're a shining star
you smile
full of wasted words that I could never tell you
look away as my face turns to stone
and I swear we could be beautiful
my love
look away as my heart turns to stone
forever wrapped in splinters
and the bruises of my every breath
my darling
hold these tears and remember me
as I join the clouds
forever wrapped in a dream of you
devour her soul
dehumanize
paint a picture of plastic perfection
leave the shell empty and lost
innocence bleeds away
we're just as guilty
exploit her
reevaluate her worth
you pigs
I hope your eyes rot out
fix them on your creation
your Barbie doll bombshell
the child cries inside
the child dies inside
a portrait of lust absorbs callous stares
through the eyes of jackels
devour her soul
dehumanize
strip away her worth
love is lost
swallow the hatchet
where it's safe
where they can't kill me
she walks along the flames
she walks on the softest clouds
too high for me to touch her
too high for her to hear my voice
I'll bury these words in the back of my throat
and I'll bury these feelings under my skin
where they can't kill me
she walks along the flames
where she can't get burnt
she walks where it's safe
she walks away from me
rain
render my surrender
replenish refurnish
the house was occupied
there is no seeing through it
her vision was blurred
wait lets start over
it was all a game
I lost
she took my peace and ran
a far cry from pestilence
on angels wings it descended
I thought I was wrong
why couldn't I see it for what it was
a twisted web lies behind every page
how many times will I weep this song
how many lies will I hide behind
parting with such dementia
my sweet bathsheba
forgotten
Death is all around me violence and decay
Screams of the dying never leave my mind
Where blood and iron flow the iron crosses grow
Unseeing eyes staring into nothingness
Faced down and thrashed to oblivion
Forged with hate
Embrace the moment of death
Now it all comes clear
After this there'll be nothing to fear
I will ignite the world at last
Only the living are lost persisting at any cost
All these years I've stayed faithful
Through bitterness I've bled
Tragedy of the faithful dying for a lost cause
Tragedy of the faithful loyalty unto death
At the mercy of the vengeful
Mislead and betrayed
Through darkness and misery
I've walked the bloodstained path
Tragedy of the faithful
So many has fallen
Tragedy of the faithful
Loyalty unto death
Godfearing despairing each prayer a human grave
Shallow and ashen the foundation of souls
Hollow existence victimized and scorned
One man's insanity revenge and retribution
Winds of war tear the world apart
There is no peace has ever been man killing man
Strong defeat the weak we're always at war
Dance of death burning world drowned in flames
Life's bitter journey towards the end
Your time has come
Pass the threshold and beyond
Wear the flesh of fallen angels
Leave your earthly form behind
A life of misery and pain has come to it's end
Lies lies see the madness in their eyes
Undead my savior from tomb to womb I folow thee
Stigmatized crucified I bleed my ife unto you
Seeking the source of the dark I've become
Hatred and soul is now one
Killing the source of the light I despise
Hatred and life is now one
People dead and buried filling my head with fear
Now I've realized it will never end
Goodbye to the world
Cannot find final words
The dark shadows disappear
As I pull the triggerBloodcraft is the bloodshed
It preys on pagan fears
Blackened fate is what awaits
Nevermind your wasted fate
Bloodcraft is the fury
Of waters raging in silence
The prime of chaos beyond
On the red horizon it stands
Bloodcraft is the carnage
Of all those who were sworn
To free mankind from perversion
And spread the scum of the divine
Bloodcraft out of the heavens
Sends the flagellating rain
The descending star is the sign
That all you fools are gonna die
Bloodcraft is the bloodshed of pagan nations
Bloodcraft of painful roots
The early days of sacrifice
Stone steel and flesh
The smell of blood divine
Blood sprays towards fire
Sing to thy god a painful chant
Bloodcraft
Storming process of violation
Open the abyss to wastelands
Nocturnal cycle of degradation
Deluvian nature awakened
Silent ominous waves pound
Vultures prepare their arrival
Killing ground shakes
Crumbling mountains explode like bombs
Raging sea swallows the land
Dragging Earth's fate into the void
Volcanoes enraged
Skies decayed
Molten rocks descend
Smoldering nations in pain
Monstrous tide
Divine genocide
Torrential flood
Natural Genocide
Wrath of primeval madness
Forged from vicious roots
Timeless existence plagued soul
I vindicate the renegade ones
Full moon serpent spirit
Emerging in days of vindication
Ravager fatherless inexorable
Ill nature aberration of creation
Primitive derangement
Forged from self holocaust
Timeless vicious hatred
By nihilistic fire I was burnt
Specters of primitive summoning
Forged from self damnation
Straight vicious wrath
Straight vicious wrath
My twisted image mirrored in red
Break the reflections into shards
Within the serpent's gaze
I see the coming of a painful dawn
I stand for refusal the vilest enemy
As decimate all till it turns into dust
Dominate the warfare
Hate me despise me
For I reveal the horrors you fear
Nameless scum of the earth
You die every time you speak my name
Defiant domain sworn assassin
Waiting for you at the front line
Adversary of what you breed
I spit in the face of the idol you praise
Enshrined by fierceness unleashed
Haunted by a destructive wish
Ravenous son of the jungle
I came to bring you pain
A hollow altar
Hides on truth
Rotten like carrion
Silent it remains
Nothing is divine when a defiled child cries
Nothing is kind on the mind of the mighty whore
Nothing is heard when a dead fetus is born
Nothing like god to save it all from its sins
Rank scent early death vultures stalk
In the house of god
Undead holy embryo small skeletons and dust
In the house of god
Holocaust of innocence lustful delight
In the house of god
Oh father tyrant of all
Crowned in highness pervert mundane
Oh father of angelic tales
Violate the child you love
Oh father of whipped sons
Punish them in days of redemption
Defiled sworn of the corrupted father
He must kill the unwanted son
Brutal passion of love divine
He must kill the unwanted son
Father's perversion
Oh lord of broken promises
Traumatize them feed thy lust
Oh lord of whores and betrayers
Give light to a new Sodom
Oh lord of miracles and misery
Prophesy thy heavenly lies
Savage merciless assassination
In a pagan ruined territory
Children of god's annihilation
Women's profane decapitation
Heart of the abysmal world
Opened wide inferno untamed
Savage cruel destination
To disciples of a suicidal oath
Order of infernal inheritance
Sworn sons to a painful death
Suicidal religious glory
Must destroy all non divine
Origin of the most infernal
Bombshell shatters all villages
Women and children embrace
Pulverized in a collective grave
Dried blood beneath the sand
Loyal servants of killing
Promised to conquer the heavens
For the glory of the messiah's hunger
Earthly lives must be consumed
In the beginning of centuries
Hatred of the nations collided
And the killing for gods unleashed
In a world abused and raped
Temples of waste were raised
Demented leaders worshipped
Conflicts demands tyranny
Within the procedure of existence
Cowardly men surrender and bow
Relying on the lies about purification
Saviours and prophecies all created
Conflicts demands new god
Endurance of the earth so fragile
Massacre and wars across the globe
Crosses burnt yet worshipped
Mankind united in deception
In the beginning of centuries
Hatred of the nations collided
Puppets of an old broken existence
Gathered to cry and exalt the almighty
Worshipping as they seek the golden key
To enter the heavens to be free of all sins
Symbols reversed inner conflict
Multitude stalking the cycle is broken
A religious bomber came to pray
Walls of temples fall
Upon masses who bow
Altars of shame now burnt
Symbols of scum held high
Penitent cries as the pale horse rides
A sudden explosion decimates the crowd
Hello victims
I can almost taste it
It's the need to see you die
You thought you had it made
Well here's your final shock surprise
How do you like it
My unfaithful friend
How do you like it
How do you like my Sweet Revenge
Turn the key in the door
No one close to hear you scream
You'll never imagine the pain
Even in you're foulest dreams
How do you like that
Invitation friend
How do you like that
That's what I call my Sweet Revenge
So sweet to see you
Writhe and crawl and scream for life
But I can't listen now
I'm too busy with the knife
I don't hear you laughing
My dismembered friend
I don't hear you laughing
When my thoughts are close to die
I will let all tears
Flow down with my fears
As a last insult
I will face the world
Then I will say to all
That I saw you fall
In this fuzzy life
I see you clearly
You are just a thought
But I can touch you
Now I found you
You are lying on the floor
You wanted to touch the sky
Your wings are broken now
This is the mankind story but this is man story
Flying higher and higher
And you burn your soul
Run away you have the time
Beware of life demons
Run away you have the time
Beware of life demons
Sunlight in my eyes
But no tears falling
I'm running to you
But I can't catch you
Now I'm lying
Surround by the light of dreams
I wanted to touch the sky
But I have no wings
This is the mankind story this is man story
Flying higher and higher
And you burn your soul
Run away you have the time
Beware of life demons
Run away you have the time
Beware of life demons
Somewhere in the sky
When my thoughts are close to die
I will let all tears
Flow down with my fears
As a last insult
I will face the world
Then I will say to all
That I saw you fall
Hey you look at me
I've got a story
Of seven men who left the earth
We told them show us now
Rest of space you'll be ours heroes
'til the end of time
the pride of XXth century
A star ship scans the universe
1998 a milestone in history
Messager one left the earth
No sign no failure no fault
Outer space was at hand now
third from the sun seven of kind
A mission that could but succeed
Seven onboard with a message from mankind
Messager one at full speed
The journey came to a halt
Messager one met no land
Sending out desperate radar beams
The star ship disappeared like ghost
Suddenly no spot on the screen
Messager one was reported lost
Now they're bound to nowhere they rest in space
Now they're bound to nowhere without any traces
Messager one was reported lost
Third from the sun seven of kind
A mission that could but succeed
Seven onboard with a message from mankind
Messager one at full speed
Now they're bound to nowhere they rest in space
Now they're bound to nowhere without any traces
Messager one was reported lost
Third from the sun seven of kind
A mission that could but succeed
Seven onboard with a message from mankind
Messager one at full speed
Third from the sun seven of kind
A mission that could but succeed
Seven onboard with a message from mankind
Messager one at full speed
Fight and ride on your black horse
And cross the darkest forest
In your heart and in your veins
The holy blood is running
And you'll see you are the onethe saviour of all
You're still waiting for that moment
For the time he'll be alive
Looking at the mystic red star
You will find the holy light
Hell is waiting for your soul
Your wild heart is pounding
But one day your holy world
Will put down your brave mask
And you will be enthrone as the wisest of lord
So the honour will embrace you
And the glory have your name
And one day you'll be the chosen one
The holy light for all mankind
And one day you'll be the flame
Of a world turning another page
I remember what my father said
My son you don't belong to anyone
Lost in doubt he takes my hands
He taught me how to make choice
No one else should help me now
Nothing less nothing more nothing I can do
For all the things we need to be someone
A real ambition burns in me
Not a question of chance satisfy me
Break the chains to set me free
Want you to believe me
Who dares wins time and again
Face to face I challenge my dreams
Hear the voice I have inside now and forever
Who dares wins time and again
Face to face I challenge my dreams
Hear the voice I have inside now and forever
The voice inside of me is the guiding light
It shows me the way to ignore all the pain
I hear this voice every where I run
Never fearing the fall that just begun
Don't you know it's not too late
Free our mind and make it right
I'm the hunter of everything in life
What my father said is always inside
Trying to catch the moment
A black horizon calls you
I'm staying here to see
These clouds of hate that surround me
Just one more try
Life is now so strange
Roaming through the city
The roads are eating my faith
Birds of freedom save me
I just want to find love
Birds of freedom save me
Now I can wash away all these tears in my eyes
Fighting and gone it's all I have done
I see the fear in your eyes
Fighting and gone they said I was wrong
Hiding their face in disguise
Don't tell me these lies
About a god I try to hear
This pain is always inside
Forever I need a little help
Remembering all I have done
At last I found my way
I follow my own rules
All I want is the right to decide
Birds of freedom save me
I just want to find love
Birds of freedom save me
Now I can wash away all these tears in my eyes
Fighting and gone it's all I have done
I see the fear in your eyes
Fighting and gone they said I was wrong
Hiding their face in disguise
Look at the light in my eyes
Birds of freedom save me
Look at the light in my eyes
Birds of freedom save me
Now I can wash away all these tears in my eyes
Fighting and gone it's all I have done
I see the fear in your eyes
Fighting and gone they said I was wrong
Hiding their face in disguise
All these days aren't the same as yesterday
And my world keeps fading away
This rising feeling of emptiness
Like a dream dying inside of me
As if time was frozen whereas I abstain myself
And this force it keeps me going
In pursuing to write my story
I feel like I never going anywhere
When the choices are showing me
And this force it keeps me going
In pursuing to write my story
Accept the absurd
Endure the betrayal
Learning is painful
Oh lord slowly
I feel consuming my soul
You asked me what's wrong with the world
No one will answer but the master
That's sit on the highchair
And watches the pain he will make
Searching solutions not for opinions
For stupid reasons you would kill
Now comes the time sorrow and pain in your mind
Running all alone on this path
On the way to hell you won't listen to
So you kill them all nobody moves
But there's something strange on their faces
You can't redeem your first attack
To late to bring the sunlight back
You can't redeem your first attack
To late to bring the sunlight back
You asked me what's wrong with the world
No one will answer but the master
That's sit on the highchair
And watches the pain he will make
Searching solutions not for opinions
For stupid reasons you would kill
Now comes the time sorrow and pain in your mind
You can't redeem your first attack
To late to bring the sunlight back
You can't redeem your first attack
To late to bring the sunlight back
Show me reasons for an end
When the night was falling
Shadows running down the walls
And when the darkness came
Something crossed their minds
And soon they realized our promises were lies
And in the dark they would not ever stop to run
If it was only a dream
It would turn into a nightmare
Now they soon will be dead
Where have we sent them tonight 
And soon they realized our promises were lies
And in the dark they would not ever stop to run
They were much stronger so deep in the night
They were dream fighters
Show them what they should be searching for
Let them realize
Sometimes they crossed the nightmare land
Hiding in the dark
They wanted only to rest in pace
Let them rest in peace
For the peace of their minds
Think of them when you're sleeping
You can't save their souls
But you can save your nights
And soon they realized our promises were lies
And in the dark they would not ever stop to run
They were much stronger so deep in the night
They were dream fighters
Show them what they should be searching for
Let them realize
Sometimes they crossed the nightmare land
Hiding in the dark
They wanted only to rest in pace
Let them rest in pace
Now I am running from the dark
And I am out of my day
And I'm out of my time
Now I'm turning back to my steps
I see again I can see you
Fear is in my mind
And I'm holding back my tears
Tell me save me
Why can't you hear me
Can't you see
Tell me believe in me
Don't you hear me
Then set me free
After so many years of faith
I am the only one to blame
I can be sure you won't forget the past
I can see in my eyes your will
Bleeding in my mind
Like a killing memory
Tell me save me
Why can't you hear me
Can't you see
Tell me believe in me
Don't you hear me
Then set me free
I never understand I feel the wind in my dreams
I never realize I feel the blood in my veins
I wanna talk to you there is no place for me now
I wanna ask to you your heart is made of steel
No don't cry for me
No one knows my pain
I would die for you to be your friend
Searching my mind
Looking for something inside
Introspection in my life
A travel with no return
Screaming in the crowd
Nobody wants to hear
Alone with a million of liars
Leaving you all is so hard
We are hunting you through this nightmare
We are fooling you such a fair game
We are hunting you through this nightmare
We are fooling you such a fair game
You're living in a lie
Searching for the truth
Masquerade of your life
No one's making you
You're living in a lie
Searching for the truth
Masquerade of your life
The reason for the world
Help your neighbour
That's what they said
Now you're all alone
Under their smiling faces
You try to understand
But something is missing for you
Maybe this is the truth
You'll never know the end
We are hunting you through this nightmare
We are fooling you such a fair game
We are hunting you through this nightmare
We are fooling you such a fair game
You're living in a lie
Searching for the truth
Masquerade of your life
No one's making you
You're living in a lie
Searching for the truth
Masquerade of your life
The reason for the world
A flame in your eyes
It shows the truth for you
No reasons to be here your world is dying now
It's a sign of the times you'll see
Running wild shellshock cracks the beams
Sweat and leather thrashing metal screams
Battle cries the power racks they roar
Blood and death upon the stage of war
The metal forces
scream
OnslaughtPower from hell
Power power power power from hell
Tyrants from hell prepare to burn our souls
Angels of death the seven trumpets hail
Tyrants from hell have lust to burn our souls
Death by the flame in darkness we shall fall
Nuclear warfare a war to end all wars
Fire from hell revelations told
Engulfed in this tomb death awaits us all
On a ship of mist
Towards a shining glow
You are leaving you
As every man shall do
So while your body dies
You reach the thousand skies
Enter oblivion
Your mortal time is done
Unlink your gemini
To become one with thy
A far but closing chime
Into the light divine
Dead to be born beyond
You will forever roam
You sail away
Have they no shame at all
They weren't no friends of yours
Their regrets in vain
They had their chance before
But now that you are gone
Remembering what they've done
And what they didn't do
The tears are too late for you
You sail away
So do you even care
When you're dead who's there
You are too far away
To hear them anyway
Death comes to everyone
To make sure his will be done
But before you die
Remember say goodbye
Then sail away Sail away
The battle's lost
The army scattered in destruction
The king is dead
He drove his sword into a stone
A land without a king
Who'll be the one to follow
No one managed
No man worthy of the throne
Break the spell you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
In his court of Camelot
The knights of the round table
To lead the Britains
Is his life and prophecy
Deceived by Morgana Lefay
His bastard sister
Berawed was left the nation
Of sorrow and of plague
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
Must solve the quest of time
The grail is the salvation
Saved from evil and
Abandoned to be found
Hail the king
Heed the dragon's fire
Called up with anger
From the deepest agony
Break the spell you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
Dark eyes staring through crystal
Wild laughs demons of wisdom
Recall all the heretics of the dawn
Cry out the names of the angels
Spell god as in the beginning
Profane is the devil's grimoire
Salute the sage he's the last in line
He sin too well but so do I
He's in all he's you and me
He is the king of infinity
Rise up enter my shadow
Siege me make me eternal
Save me give me that piece of harmony
Pure me sermon by fire
Burn up envious liar
Black skies will darken
The world forever more
In a world of mystery
He shall rule yes you shall see
He's in all he's in you and me
He is the king of infinity
Dark angel of sin
He's calling to bring
Dark angel of sin
He's calling to bring
Preach me the sefer Jezirah
Dark years Fata Morgana
Black tears falling for the Antichrist
Rise up enter my shadow
Dark eyes demons of wisdom
Black skies will darken
The world forever more
Salute the sage he's the last in line
He sin too well but so do I
He's in all he's in you and me
He is the king of infinity
Dark angel of sin
He's calling to bring
We are the elder of a race
We are sent to see we are one
And I am them all
We are neither black nor white
I am a paler shade of eternity and what
You can see
From the depths of humanity
You have let it loose
The tide of destiny
As I search for the holy one
Your life is running out of time
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water so sustained
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water in her veins
I'm making circles in the sand
With magic herbs I forfill
These pentagrams
Among the living I have searched
I can't find the truth
That's why I'm calling you
Deat father time do not deny this call
As Lemuria the Earth will fall
Veil the legacy of sinister
And all the evil that man do
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water so sustained
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water in her veins
Black dust of evil wars
Bloodsheds and broken laws
Blue skies are turning grey
Nuclear and gamma rays
There's a tomb for everyone
And for the deeds that you have don
I hold the keys to paradise
You hold the keys to sin and lies
I can't deny that we have laughed
At your society power games
And technology
You fool of man you inquire into things
You're not supposed to know
You don't know where the limit goes
From the depths of humanity
You have let it loose
The ride of destiny
As I search for the holy one
Your life is running out of time
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water so sustained
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring wated in her veins
The darkest places
Are not paradise
I am the shadow
I am the depths of your soul
The tribes of earth have died
By the wave  the mighty tide
I have walked tomorrow's path
There I saw the shame of the past
There's a tomb for everyone
And for the deeds that you have done
But every sin and every crime
Shall be forgiven by the river of time
We have to go back to where we belong
Poor Mother Earth
We've been here far too long
We are flying back to paradise
On our wings of destiny
To a place where sorrow dies
From the depths of humanity
You have let it loose
The tide of destiny
As I search for the holy one
Your life is running out of time
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water so sustained
There's a rumour of rain
Pouring water in her veins
The battle's lost
The army scattered in destruction
The king is dead
He drove his sword into a stone
A land without a king
Who'll be the one to follow
No one managed
No man worthy of the throne
Break the spell you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
In his court of Camelot
The knights of the round table
To lead the Britains
Is his life and prophecy
Deceived by Morgana Lefay
His bastard sister
Berawed was left the nation
Of sorrow and of plague
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
He's the eyes of the war
He's the force of the law
Magician absolute
He's the eyes he's the ears
Knowing lies and your fears
The sorcerer supreme
Must solve the quest of time
The grail is the salvation
Saved from evil and
Abandoned to be found
Hail the king
Heed the dragon's fire
Called up with anger
From the deepest agony
Break the spell you son of a king
Excalibur awaits you
Rule our land guide us the way
Give us back the glory we once had
I'm rumbling down that street of mine
There is no sun but my car still shine
I'm burning rubber on that road
With my fourwheel drive
With explosive load
Born to drive drive to die
Die to live then drive again
I know that for me there ain't no grave
Because I am the death in a black beret
Horny girls they wanna ride
So I take them in and fuck their pride
Razamanaz I feel so alive
In my satanic turbo four wheel drive
Born to drive drive to die
Die to live then drive again
I know that for me there ain't no grave
Because I am the death in a black beret
I'm rumbling down that street of mine
There is no sun but my car still shine
I'm burning rubber on that road
With my fourwheel drive
With explosive load
Born to drive drive to die
Die to live then drive again
I know that for me there ain't no grave
Because I am the death in a black beret
Have I seen all there is to see
Or is there more left to be
The deepest of thoughts
The fantasies the neverending
Harmonies
Here I am locked in reality
In a world of anxiety
I have to escape
Explore the possibilities
Can dreams become true
On a unicorn I am riding
To the wonderland
I'll hold her silver mane face a dream
I wonder if I will return
From my journey to the wonderland
Far away deep within universe
Through the arcades of mystery
The dullness is gone
My mind collecting pieces
Of a life I will live
On a unicorn I am riding
To the wonderland
Me they will rehabilitate with
A straitjacket on
They wonder if I will return
From my journey in the wonderland
They are searching but they can't find
I am hiding inside my mind
Can you keep a secret I'm not me
I am forever in my fantasy
On a unicorn I am riding
To the wonderland
I'll hold her silver mane face a dream
I wonder if I will return
From my journey to the wonderland
Wonderland wonderland
Take me to that neverland
Wonderland
Lets see ya dance dance dance
The wise man and the vagabond
Walking on a mission
Searching for an answer
Looking for a sign
See the seven seals have been broken
And the world has taken end
Manifestation on the horizon
The battle has begun
Angels fighting angels
Heaven is painted red
A crimson rain is falling
Down on the earth
That we have lent
Battle of Evermore
This is war
The battle of Evermore
Of Evermore
This is war
The battle of Evermore
The battle of Evermore
The battle of Evermore
The battle of Evermore
A small pain
A little pain
A big pain
A great pain
Growing here
Growing there
Growing slowly everywhere
The creature chants
While the spirits rise
While a dead man lives a living man dies
Growing here
Growing there
Growing slowly everywhere
Choke choke choke
Devils we awoke
Thirst thirst thirst
Suffer until you burst
Cry cry cry
Fire burn your eye
Die die die
Knowing just as I
Eve of Mourn
Sickness formsseasons
Beauty gone

Sorrow in and out of the point of pain
Rebornby the way of thoughts gained
Helplesssearching for the answer to death
Dyingwaiting for the last breath
Deformeddeformed lives
Forgotten ones scream in painlost in demise
Wither and die
Decieved by the belief in hope
Bow down before the fate of all
Sea of blisswave of conscious all drowning
How could i be so blind
Sickened by perversionthe pain of lies
A faint voice beckons me to reprise
Paralysed by pityhatred
I can see the tears flow as blood cries
Searching for the answerto depart
I've cried for God as the children stray
Depart nowsave them
Lifenothing to gain
Is it a dreamhiding the pain
Taking the soulleaving its form
The bending of thoughts opens the gates
Bathe in the blood of Destiny
Replacing the mind for what is real
Making the soul immortal
To summon the spirit of what is dead
Watching as they perishdestroy
I can see the blood shed as i laugh in mourn
Faith of resurrectionbeckoned
Looking to reverse embraced destiny
Glowing incantationsearching
I have found the answer to extinction
The soul returns
Life is blind
Deathi need the flesh
I need the poweri feel the pain
salvations endopen the corpse
Enter the life crushing its formrising above
Warning to allrapture in blood
Render the causemet in mistrust
Pleasure if sinfate of a world decaying within
Now depart
Eclipse
Death arise
Internal death sentence is made
Eaten from within
Medical science has failed
Try to carve it out
Innocent children will die
Never lived their lives
Fears of the past arise
Still there is no cure
Blood soaked in misery
Dying in agony
Atarting to eat away
There is no way to breathe
Death is the destiny
Gutted in ecstasy
Forced into lunacy
Awaiting the final day
Devour the soul
disease has taken control
Unsuspecting victims of fate
Vomit up your blood
Half eaten innards decay
Soon infection spreads
Only will to live retained
Eyes that glow in doom
All internal organs are gone
Take your final breath
Raped of virtueled to betrayal
Darkness summonedvows to renew
Age of blackened hearts
When darkness once resigned
Memories of dreams past
Torn by the nether world
Tears drowning your face
As the saviour comes
And the angels fell to the suffering
Led by the lies of disharmony
Starving the soul with lifes agony
Demons have risen to summon the dead
Riding the world of humanity
Taking the dreams of life swept away
Memories once known are lost in dismay
A hybrid of sorrowpain and despair
Lost of a hope that is too late to save
Age of blackened hearts
When darkness once resigned 
Memories of dreams past
Torn by the nether world
Tears drowning your faceas the saviour comes
Lost in your disgracelife it has swept away
Blood to water
Bathe in desire
Love is beckoned
But hate has come
Mass exterminationgenocide
Racial eliminationthey decide
Corpses were to cremate
Living were to suffocate
The terror from within
when expectancy is death
The fear of knowing when life ends
The fate is in their hands
Enter the realm of the genoicidal holocaust
Come to a time when children were born to fear
Enter the ashes of the genocidal holocaust
When extermination left no cries to hear
Hearthe cries
Abolish slaveryengage in death
Gas fills the airtake your last breath
Incinerated bodies a mile high
Women and childrenthey were forced to die
Amputation of the limbs
Mortification soon sets in
Millions of people betrayed by lies
Time to kiss your lives goodbye
Decimate the Unbornkill
Experiment on anyonetransplants
genetic reconstruction
The will to live has gone
A living hell on earth
A sworn pact made in blood to destroy
The discovery was absurd
A monstrosity to the world
Suffer
Torn by betrayal
Beaten and used
Ingest your morals
As the innocent are fucked against their will
The truth it haunts me
Sublimination
Seeing is believing
But its your blindness that still prevails
Your greed and your powertools of the trade
When sadness is pleasure
Its your existence that i deny
Erosion to fill the mind
Pray for an afterlife
Life that will scar the soul
Lost all fucking hope
Harvest of misery
Starving a selfish plea
Shadows of dreams now past
A nightmare soon fills your eyes
Denouncing the saviourin murderous ways
A perverted devotion
Cleansed by the acid of denialembraced by incest
In pleasures of flesh
Abort the bastard
Caused by your fathera man to hate
Death in resentmenta hybrid of sin
Rotted Paradise
Shredding the fleshbleeing to death
Skinned aliveblood flowsthey die
Self indulged by hatred
Resurrection unseen
Can you feel the cold blade penetrate inside you
Blood becomes a river of everlasting happiness
Thoughts now deteriorate
life will disintegrate
Flowas blood flows
Flowas blood flows
Scarred by perverse dreams
Away you bastard dog
Truth becomes all lies
No one seems to mind
Have you ever wondered why
Your lifes a living hell
Have you ever wondered why
The tears flow like blood
Cutting with a razorfeeling of sensation
Dripping in the nectarfeeling of perfection
Falling out of organsthe rancid mutilation
Bathing in excrementfeeling the enjoyment
Ripping of the entrailsscreaming to exhale
Suffer internal bleedingcant escape the feeling
Ending of paindying in vain
living the liesin death blood cries
Darknessinternal
Lost soulshelpless cries
Insanitya dream
The path to death is free
Endless torment of battered feelings
Morbid thoughts elude the brain
Voices persist in rage
Alone inside a world of pain
Lost within the mind
Confined in an array of fear
Memories fade away
Mental powers under siege
As i lay dying inside
Nightmareshaunting
Mentality restrained
Confliction imprisons
The beast inside me
Memories fade the hate
Of thoughts once known
Dying inside
There is fire there is flame burns
There are dead souls voices of sinful
ThoseÃÂ  lands are bloodcovered
There is the war unending
Cries and misery dwells around
Tortures of malicious demons
Dead mirrors of salvation
Cause blackness covers the faces
But shine of hope Is here
Groskherd will rise again
But shine of hope Is here
And darkness saves the world
But shine of hope Is here
Groskherd will rise again
But shine of hope Is here
And darkness saves the world
Groskheeeeeeeeeeerd
The toggrit will come back Demon of solitude
And flames of firesÃÂ  will grow
And darkened demons will gather
And flags will raise the spirits
Chains of evil will be broken
And Satan will fall in great battle
And black light of the sun
Will shine in underworld
As every toggrit knows
That power is throbbing in hearts
ThatÃÂ  fire burning in souls
To bring a peace into torrential
But shine of hope Is here
Groskherd will rise again
But shine of hope Is here
And darkness saves the world

Groskherd will rise
But shine of hope Is here again
And darkness saves the world
Groskheeeeeeeeeeerd
Life like a death
Flickering into eyes
Every breath and every step
Kills a part ofÃÂ  myself
Eternity is a part
OfÃÂ  life now
Vortex of annihilation
Merciless of chaos
The horrible games
A nature of evil
Dead or alive
And perpetual hell inside
I call for you god Esmu
Fill my soul with cold
Take away all my feelings
And fill me with a gloomy grey
I call for you god Esmu
To rise again in this world
To fill a bowl with elixir
With a mystic life
Ruins breath of emptiness
There is no life
And EsmusÃÂ  sculpture tear
Will fill the life with death
Suicide and misery
Flow into world of madness
Cant stop this wind
Wind of suffering
All is terrible all is sad
Spirit and body burned by
Flame of a bitter pain
Eyes covered with white veil
I call for you god Esmu
Fill my soul with cold
Take away all feelings a life
And fill me with a gloomy grey
I call for you god Esmu
To rise again in this world
To fill a bowl with elixir
With a mystic life
War that destroying borders
War that ruin towns
That bornsÃÂ  a pain and suffering
Destroying new dreams
The land of dead creators
Is covered by shade of abandonment
Only shout of callous creature
On a distant horizon
This is voice of dead witch
This is voice that brings fear
All her acts on earthÃÂ 
Heartlessly cursed by destiny
Heartlessness brings the painÃÂ 
By destroying essence of life
Heartlessness brings the fear
Destroying all morals
Heartlessneeeeess
No strength to break
The witches spell
The battle is over
The war is lost
Passions were bright like fire
But now the bodies covered by cold
Soil drained the blood
Black flowers grow
Just heartlessness around
With darkness painted dreams
And every night in town
The dead wild shout is heard
The scream of heartlessness
Heartlessness brings the pain
By destroying essence of life
Heartlessness brings the fear
Destroying all morals
Heartlessneeeeess
Heartlessness broke the morality
By fire souls burned
Heartlessness froze the blood
Death takes the breath forever
Heartlessneeeeess
When a somber night
Of darkest shadows will falling
When the spark will be growingÃÂ 
And power of darkness will be rising
And demonwarriors of Nikron
Will raise their flags
AndÃÂ  attack with black cloud
But will be broken
And revived Groskherd
Will be rising
With new force
And with new passion
And souls will be filled
With a victorious call
And hordes of immortals
Will break bounds of curse
And souls will be filled
With a victorious call
And spirits of despaired ones
Will be rescued
Fires of the callous ones
Will be drowningÃÂ  in darkness
One by one
Malicious cities will be falling
Satan the great will be
dethroned by Beheroght
In a last battle
In a last fight
He will not be saved
By gods or Azura demons
And body of the mortal king
Will be covered by eternal coffin
the world will be embraced by silence
Praise to gods praise
And souls will be filled
With a victorious call
And hordes of immortals
Will break bounds of curse
And souls will be filled
With a victorious call
And spirits of despaired ones
Will be rescued
I am your majesty
Noise of death I'll hear
Never change the course
I have your soul of death
Diiiiieeeeeeeeee 
Cut by knife
I scream like hell
Blood red I spill
Raining blood
I should never lied
Blood red I spill 
I am your worst nightmare you ever had
I scream in your head your blood turns red
I call you in the darkest death
When you have arrived you can't find back
Voices tells me what to say and do
Nothing pleasant but I want to
Evil pleasures in my fantasies
Not enough NO Not enough for me 
Voices  Hell bound
Voices  Blood spill
Voices  Carnage
EVIL  voices 
Am I evil or am I just insane
Am I a pervert totally deranged
But I like the nasty thing I do
Living out my fantasy on you 
Nothing could stop me from hurting you
Seeing you fear makes my dream come true
Evil pleasures in my fantasy
Not enough NO Not enough for me
I know the time
When you grow up
Time has not changed
After your parents' death
Time after that
You were paralysed
No family to go to
Took care of your self
Death can see
More than you know
Death can strike
Wherever you go
Your parents they died
By force they were killed
Blood in throat breath of blood
Now in this time
A big and a powerful world
You still remember
Your parents' death
Shadows the dark place in chaos
Entrails the waste from the flesh
Dry blood red as it can be
Disintegration decay from rotten bones 
Entrails a tasty entrail
Flesh and blood
Dinner for two
Show me some death 
Autopsy the final way to die
Raw meat taste the smell of fear
Coffin silence in the grave
Die 
I am the slayer
You are the victim
All shall face the death
Soon you will die 
Graveyard The end of destination
Undefeated soul Anger for mankind
Worn out To stand by your own
Immortality I shall rise again
Clouds in the sky
Rain pouring down
Protect your head
Lightning strikes again 
Stormy weather
Blood on leather
Death is rising
Blood is flowing 
Piles of flesh and bones
Ripped off by the dead
Awakened by the storm
You're now without head 
We are all helpless
Weather have such power
Black clouds are forming
They want you dead 
Cloud dark and ugly
Thunder can be heard
Give me your best shot
Goodbye bastards
Dying and helpless punishment
The life is silent as the grave
The attempt is doomed to failure
To be in mortal fear
Obituary notice fatally massacred
To the visions of the fatal truth
Stream in feelings heavenly meanings
On the sentence of death 
Victim of hell always grotesque
The holy master confesses
By the mortal dread
The angel saved your breath 
Euthanasia calling for you
Autopsy flesh digging pain
Euthanasia calling for you
Darkness has come to judge your death 
Dead by help dead by dawn
Entrance to hell
Rotten by cancer
Mystery disaster
Freedom of pain
Be in the death throes
Climb up the Satan's stairs
To preach with the dark side
The story was told
The crypt was old
We have a confession
The evil obsession 
Evening in a tormenting crypt
Chains around your neck
Food once a week lifetime to die
Dead flesh flowing out of your ass 
Reborn to society
Crawl with anxiety
Pain from lost mind
No one can find 
Death and smelly corpse
Buried in the walls
Graveyard in the garden
Their souls shall be reborn
Sinners shall burn
To a melting stuff
Great kingdom shall rise
Cause of sinners doom
Memories from that time
Slowly rot away
No one misses their friend
Cause sinners shall burn in hell
Make some noise
Scream and exterminate
Violence to hell
The sinners are born again
Ruin the world
Fight the life
Of remaining crowd
Your doom is near
For nothing the pain ends
Be drunk to kill again
So be to the great pain
And rise from the grave again
The enemy will get away
And stand gone forever
No threat to the people
The peace finally arrives
Fighting death to death
To create some life
Life who shall win
Against the dark hell
Flowing power makes
Me to win at last
Death shall be reborn
Triumph of the sinners
Night in the cold
You were working at the morgue
Have no friends was alone
There was nothing else to do
Flames from fire in a room
Questions in your head
What should I do now
Should I run or should I die 
There was a room with a corpse of fire
Moaning souls flowing through the walls
Panic reactions grab your back
Heat from flames you begin to burn 
You felt the skin fall off
Dark memories from the past
Memories that should end
If you would die 
Scarred and burned
You found some water
After that night
The wound seems to heal 
Two years later
You were walking in the morgue
The same scary noise
From flames in to the room with corpse
The bringer of plague the bringer of death
A fist in humanity's face
Unleashing the wrath save your last breath
Condemning the human race
Inverting the cross the image of Christ
The sign of weakness and lies
The world is aflame evil will rise
Torment will be your demise
You shall fall
The plague is spreading fast
Death to all
The triumph of death at last
No help from your god your feeble lord
Evoking the evil unseen
Summoning of the demonic horde
A genocidal war machine
Your god has failed he is now dead
Killed by the arch nemesis
Death is a fact blood's flowing red
Satan will take what is his
The curse of death
A swarm of plagues
You will be dead
None will survive
The curse of death
You will be dead
You are cursed
Die
Darkness ascends black clouds draw near
Only ashes remain
The end of the world it's finally here
Suffering and pain
Mankind is but a memory now
No life no laughter no light
Darkness will reign now take a bow
Sick to the bone slave to the flesh
Better put on my Sunday's best
I've been a bad little boy little boy
And I'm not not not sure that I I wanna keep it
Yeah
Everyone's got a secret
What's yours what's yours
Don't be shy I'll never repeat it
You've been a bad little girl little girl
And I'm not not not sure that I I wanna keep it
Everyone's got a secret
Tell me all about yours
Love hate
Oh how we play the game
Cold soul
No sense of self control
Love hate
Unsure to pass or play
Cold soul
Now we're out of control
Roses are red and my heart is black
We creep about the floor to indulge like rats
Enraptured we walk to nurse our obsession
Well Mrs Pharmacist if you insist
And I'm not not not sure that I I wanna keep it
Everyone's got a secret
What's yours whats yours
Don't be shy I'll never repeat it
If you wanna soar with vultures
You'll have to swallow the bone
The saint charade is over
Plastic royalty exposed
No semblance of virtue as your relevance erodes
We go queen for queen and move just like this
When you fall down will you back out
As you crawl through life with no crown
Though you preach love you package lies
Just a pawn in a king's disguise
So check me if it helps you sleep at night
When you fall down will you back out
As you crawl through life with no crown
Though you preach love you package lies
Just a pawn in a king's disguise
Don't stop breathing in the chemicals
You don't know humble though you play the role
Pockets of evergreen are your amphetamine
Please stop feeding what you can't control
You'll fall
When you fall down will you back out
As you crawl through life with no crown
Though you preach love you package lies
Just a pawn in a king's disguise
Don't stop breathing in the chemicals
You don't know humble though you play the role
Pockets of evergreen are your amphetamine
Please stop feeding what you can't control
I'll show you the worst in me what I've become
Now crawl to my boots and lick kneel before me
I'mma have a cake and fucking eat you too
It's my party and I'll die when I want to
Die when I want to
Die when I want to
The monster you've made is wearing the crown
I'll be the king and you be the clown
I'll take the blame parade it around
Reciting violence like poetry
No you can't sit with us
Too fashionably plain
Now say my name
I look much better as as the enemy
I'mma have my fucking cake and eat yours too
It's my party and I'll die when I want to
Die when I want to
Die when I want to
The monster you've made is wearing the crown
I'll be the king and you be the clown
I'll take the blame parade it around
I want you low 
I won't let you die
I'll keep you alive
Just remind you of what you are not
It's my party and I'll die when I want to
You wanna see me fail but I won't die for you
It's my party and I'll die when I want to
Die when I want to
Die when I want to
The monster you've made is wearing the crown
I'll be the king and you be the clown
It's my party and I'll die when I want to
Die when I want to
Die when I want to
I want you low
I'mma have my cake and fucking eat you too
You're mine motherfucker
Let me begin with envy's a sin
You'll have to find new words to invent
I love when you talk I just use it to drive me
I won't let your judgement define me
I'm not broken so don't fix me
I want you to hate me
Tell me what you've lost
Hang me on your cross
If you're so wise then why are you so soft
Do you leave your throne as you cast your stones
I'm above living under your microscope
Go
You're mine motherfucker
I'm insane I'm insane in the membrane
I wanna fuck your face with a switchblade
I'm not broken so don't fix me
I'll leave you behind me
Internet killed the video star
Internet kill the video star
Tell me what you've lost
Hang me on your cross
If you're so wise then why are you so soft
Do you leave your throne as you cast your stones
I'm above living under your microscope
Cry baby cry baby did I just hear you whimper
Cry baby cry suck my middle fucking finger
Cry baby cry baby
What have you done lately
Cry babe cry baby
What have you done
Tell me what you've lost
Demonize your flaws
Do they call you when dumb needs a mascot
Do you leave your throne as you cast your stones
I'm above living under your microscope
You dilate 
God of your existence
Begging me to listen while you pray
Swallow in vain
Silver spoon religion
Closer from a distance
You're mine motherfucker
Cry baby cry baby
Cry baby cry baby
You're mine motherfucker
Hey

They try to bend they try to break me by design
If it's war that you want then I'm ready to play
And the world's gonna know my name
Know my name
Know my name
Know my
Through everywhere that I go
Every failure I've owned
Every crack in my bones

Like a sleeping grenade
Built to blow you away
Pull the pin I explode
I'm untouchable
Hey

Like a sleeping grenade
Built to blow you away
Pull the pin I explode
I'm untouchable
Untouchable
I will never be silenced
Untouchable
I will eclipse the pain
Untouchable
Untouchable
You can't let it go the price that we pay
But I own the grave from which I came
You reap what you sow we don't bleed the same
'Cause I own the rights to my own fate
And I'll sleep like a king on my deathbed
Through everywhere that I go
Every failure I've owned
Every crack in my bones
I'm untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade
Built to blow you away
Pull the pin I explode
I'm untouchable
Every mile from home
Every failure I've owned
Every crack in my bones
I'm untouchable
Like a sleeping grenade
Built to blow you away
Pull the pin I explode
I'm untouchable
Hey
I'm untouchable
Hey
I'm untouchable
Hey
I'm untouchable
Hey
I'm untouchable
She's got no soul heart black as coal
And here we go again spinning me in her web
There's just no rest for the queen of the dead
Another trick to treat with candy apple dreams
Gonna rot her teeth 'cause I'm so sweet
One lick to rule them all
They crumble as they crawl
Eat eat eat til her insides are on me
Eat eat eat and nobody's gonna stop me
And in the glow of the pale moonlight
She goes for a spin on my haunted hayride
Yeah if she's got a pulse then she's not my type
Yeah if she's got a pulse then she's not my type
Yeah if she's got a pulse if she's got a pulse
She's got a temper in stock 
Made of hemlock
Uses absinthe as a lip gloss
Death hawk 
Fresh New Rock's
She'll use your corpse as a catwalk
She'll use your corpse as a catwalk
Yeah she'll use your corpse
Eat eat eat til her insides are on me
Eat eat eat and nobody's gonna stop me
And in the glow of the pale moonlight
She goes for a spin on my haunted hayride
If she's got a pulse then she's not my type
She'll use your corpse as a catwalk
Plays truth or dare in the mirror
Uses absinthe as a lip gloss
Undead but she won't shed a tear
La 
She's my graveyard
She's my
Eat eat eat til her insides are on me
Eat eat eat and nobody's gonna stop me
And in the glow of the pale moonlight
She goes for a spin on my haunted hayride
If she's got a pulse then she's not my type
D E A D
If she's got a pulse then she's not my type
Tragedy 
A poisonous lover
You infiltrate to destroy
Vanity
A cancer unforgiving
A charlatan with poise
Fool me once enough is enough
Was I more than a step on your way up
Hollowed out I've no semblance of love
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck
Lest we learn the tables turn so I'm betting out
I'm betting out
I'm getting out
Theres nothing left to repair
Ravenous
Self righteous and lurid
But how much more til you break
Scavenger
So fucking undeserving
You slither in just to take what you can take
Counterfeit I'm calling your bluff
Was I more than just a step on your way up
Now you'll burn and you're flesh out of luck
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck
Now you're just somebody that I used to fuck
Lest we learn the tables turn so I'm betting out
I'm betting out
I'm getting out
Against insight I fed your source of revenue
It means nothing
Open grave I was too blind to see
That love spelled to you is F A M E
You fuck your way up the ladder
Going down on your way to the top
Do your arms ever tire
Or do they heal while you climb with your mouth
Delete everything
Sever the yearning
You can keep the fucking ring
Delete everything
You can keep the fucking ring
Lest we learn the tables turn so I'm betting out
I'm betting out
I'm getting out
Against insight I fed your source of revenue
It means nothing
It means nothing
Nothing left to repair
Voices in my head again
Trapped in a war inside my own skin
They're pulling me under
Go
I've swallowed myself but the fever remains
I'm numb to the pleasure but still feel the pain
If I told you the truth would you dare me to lie
Voices in my head again
Beating me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices
Voices
I curse not the wicked I praise not the blessed
If I told you the truth you'd beg me to change
If fear were a currency you'd own the bank
Voices in my head again
Beating me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices
You can't take me from me
Voices in my head again
Head again head again
Voices in my head again
Beating me in a war I can't win
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices
Voices
They're pulling me under
Voices
Voices
You gotta be loud you gotta be rude
So the world can hear you
You gotta be crass you gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up turn it up now
And when they turn their backs on you
You gotta be loud you gotta be rude
So the world can hear you
You gotta crass you gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up turn it up now
Loud loud rude
When nobody hears you
You gotta stand up you gotta commit
Say fuck it make the best of it
A broken home you're trying to mend
You got one day to pay the rent
You gotta be loud you gotta be rude
So the world can hear you
You gotta crass you gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up turn it up now
Loud loud rude
When nobody hears you
You gotta stand up you gotta commit
Say fuck it make the best of it
Oh
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
You gotta be 
You gotta be loud you gotta be rude
So the world can hear you
You gotta crass you gotta be cold
It's everything we know
Turn it up turn it up now
Loud lour rude
When nobody hears you
You gotta stand up you gotta commit
Say fuck it make the best of it
Oh make the best of it
Fuck it ffffuck it fuck it fuck it
What are you waiting for
Another day a double shot of hate
It's everything we know
Drink it up like gasoline
Fuck it make the best of it
Go
Burn it down brick by brick  made in 2006
Lost and found losing grip  I needed this
Question me not for I gave up everything
No sign of stopping till my veins rust
I fucking know where I came from
And nothing can replace those lessons learned
Whoa  no longer haunted by the skeletons
Whoa  no longer haunted by the past
For so long it's all I've known
I'm crossing over the undertow
For so long no one was listening
Determined to make their deaf ears ring
Miles repeat my worst enemy is me
But then 4 soon became 6
To shatter the canvas
Handed nothing loss pulling the strings
Outlived the dead trends
United by distance
For so long it's all I've known
I'm crossing over the undertow
For so long no one was listening
Determined to make their deaf ears ring
No money no sleep dedication
10 years on the road this is sacred
And when I'm facing a wall I do not quit
Cause if you mean it you will make it
Pulled apart in a world so demanding
I'm still here still standing
I've sweat blood from Stockholm to Scranton
Still here still standing
For so long it's all I've known
I'm crossing over the undertow
For so long no one was listening
I did my time
If you mean it you'll make it
Dissociative but it takes its toll
Can I surpass time or would I start to rust
Depreciating collecting dust 
And I fear myself as I fall away
In a cold deluded sense of fate
When the nightmares come and the doubt sets in
Will the fever break or will I burn from within
It's too late to feel I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand enslaved by the hourglass
Will I live again or will I fade to black
Dehumanizing when the heart attacks
Will I expire before my dreams unfold
As the walls melt and the light fades
I'm letting quicksand take me
As the walls melt and light fades
I'm letting quicksand take me
It's too late to feel I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand enslaved by the hourglass
If you look beyond the blindfold
You'll find the hole in my soul
One fear one mind
No hope no time
If you look beyond the blindfold
You'll find the hole
Trying to rewrite the storyline
It's too late to feel I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand encased in the hourglass
It's too late to feel I've lost my breath
With the hands of time around my neck
Am I more than the pen that wrote the past
Or am I just the sand encased in the hourglass
Fear is not my fate
Fear is not my fate
Blow the bridge to the past 
Wipe the fingerprints
Melt your heart encased in wax
Steal it with a kiss
Our fate engraved
Scar enslaved as we mutually destruct
Repose my love
I've sinned enough for the both of us
In the name of love
I'm ready to bury all of my bones
I'm ready to lie but say I won't 
So tell me your secrets and join me in pieces
To rot in this garden made of stones
Eternally yours
Eternally yours
I feed like you taught me and selfishly swallow
We coalesce in darkness so selfishly hollow
Examine the wreckage writhing in tempo
Invisible anguish casting a shadow
And in the name of love
I'm ready to bury all of my bones
I'm ready to lie but say I won't 
So tell me your secrets and join me in pieces
To rot in this garden made of stones
Eternally yours
Eternally yours
As we rest in pieces though I know not your name
I would suffer forever to absolve all your pain
And in the name of love
I'm ready to bury all of my bones
I'm ready to lie but say I won't 
So tell me your secrets and join me in pieces
To rot in this garden made of stones
I'm ready to bleed to make amends
And sleep in this dirt we call our bed
So tell me your secrets and join me in pieces
To fall and rewrite the bitter end
Eternally yours
Eternally yours
Eternally yours
Eternally yours
Thousand thrones roar
Signals to mortals
The outbreak of war
Now comes the time
To repay for blood
That shed our father
For their ruined homes
Desecrated by christian dogs
The wolf way i'll fight
Eagle sign meaning will give
To offering in battle fulfilled
Bloody glow upon the sky
Steel hooves beat the earth
Here come the chariots of gods
In this battle I am not alone
Can you hear the stories
Told by the melody of horns
Can you see the swords
Shiny like evening stars
Can you see the horses
Running like morning breeze
In the fires of battle
Death called lords and servants
Brave warriors sleeps
The longlasting sleep
Underneath the earth
Where the great river's bank
Was the colour of mother's tears
Wake up you heroes of forgotten days
Arise you valiant warriors
It's time to fight the night descends
Saddle your horses
And blow the horns
Ahead Slavonic tribe
Mothers don't waste your tears in vain
As the warrior who's gone was bold
And death he met the noble way
Out on the battlefield
Over his grave far away in the woods
Let women bow down their heads
Cause men are called
By the mighty horns
To go back and fight again
Intently I watch
The sacred fire on my
Weather beaten face
I feel it's glow
My hand gives steel
The shape of the sword
That will turn my son
into a hero
Scops will praise him in 
their legends
Bards will praise him in their songs
Eagles will wield it
To high skies
The day has come for
My son to learn
The riddle of steel
The day when his fate is done
When the heritage is
Given to him
I swear by all our gods and by their
Holy laws that I shall obey the
Discipline of steel whose
Secret i've learnt from you your words
Will make me strong should weakness
Or doubt arise I turn my eyes
To the overwhelming majesty
Of the snowy peaks stabbing gloomy
Clouds my fathers sword in my hand
The blood sears in my veins
By my heritage by my legacy to you my father
I swear to guard the secret of steel that
Fills warrior's heart with might
Oh father that called me to this
World should this be your will
I'll obey
This proves how worthy I am
Oh my ancestors glory and fame
Thunder behind me glory ahead
Nothing can drag me away from the gods' path
Shown by my father for I am the man
Whose heart is the heart of steelI stand bare
With my hands bloody
As I scream
It was the Devil in me
I stand alone
With nobody to hold
As I scream
It was the Devil in my soul
No altars
No vindication for what was said
I am barely breathing
Wishing I was dead
No need to lie
My world is dying
 so am I
Now my soul has died
The thought of you
Tears me apart inside
I once had you
But now we're lost in time
I am shamed
All I can do is hide
In Hell where no one can hear my cries 
I had everything
That I ever dreamed
Now it's gone
How can this be
Seven years
Yet it seems to have not meant a thing
All my fears
Have become reality
Carry this till I grow old
This pain will never fold
 this hole in my soul
Will never fucking close
DEAD
That's all I want to be
LAST
That's all I'll ever be
Truth be told my soul was sold 
For Lucifer is I
I keep asking what is wrong with me
All this questioning is so depressing
This reality is so punishing
Why won't they let me just be happy
I feel so hopeless
I can't control it
Burning in these flames of my memories
This inadequacy will be the death of me
Flames rising my soul is dying
I stand so empty with thoughts so deadly
I need some time to reflect
I have no hope all I want is death
Death death death is it my time yet
All is wrong because your hope is gone
Is there any way I can erase your pain
I've got to learn to stand alone in this world
And accept the fate of others I cannot change
Flames rising my soul is dying
I stand so empty with thoughts so deadly
All questions no answers
Lord kill me much faster
Some solace I seek
All sorrow no glee
Why 
A truth that I refuse to believe
There is no hope in my means
Demons plague my sleep
This evil weighs on my feet
The depths below are calling me
Hell is blinding I can't see
Shadow of the damned in me
I can't breathe
A cancer of my being
A bastard of my dreams
This despair  pain
Won't seem to go away
This disgust  hate
Won't seem to fade
My burdens yesterday
Are problems of today
My problems yesterday
Are burdens of today
With suicide on my mind
I now know it's time
To end this life
Why live when I can fucking die 
I never stood a chance
It was all in my past
Why live when I can fucking die 
I should have known now I'm left alone
So easily replaced just another fucking face
Love led me stray
Now I dread to see another day
To think any of it mattered
Hollow love is now shattered
This was never meant to be
There is no you and me
The poison in the glass
The love I could never have
In fear of myself
I threw it all in to hell
In fear of tomorrow
I exchanged bliss for sorrow
You've made it hard to see the beauty in me
The beauty in me
Lost what I love
Now I'm left with nothing
But a pain in my heart
 mental suffering
A perception of bliss
Of a life lived without me
Do you ever just think of my name
Do you ever just picture my face
Time  time again
I've proved myself to be
The worst friend
Now I'm gone  I'm lost
In this state of agony
Now I'm gone  I'm lost
In this state of apathy
As it seems there's nothing left
But the pain  regret
Shame  sorrow nothing less
I look at myself  I wonder
When will this way of life be no longer
I look for you  I wander
But I can see you no longer
Long long  lonely nights
Ever since you've been gone
Long long  lonely nights
I guess you're never coming home
As I go along
My lonely way
I visualize
Your face
Justify your means as to why I'm suffering
A fate so cruel but was it meant to be
I can't comprehend what any of this means
Now I'll go where I did before
To the darkest corner of my world
This hurts much like it did before
No hope seems like things are getting worse
The darkest days lead me to a deadly change
In a world without you
I'm truly going insane
I find myself struggling with the truth
A part of me died when I lost you
I was hoping you could hear my voice
Can't turn back
I have no choice
I was hoping you could see my face
Can't go there
Though there's no time I would waste
Brothers Eternal
From this world to the inferno
The detriment of my existence
A fate with no escape
Endless struggle for meaning
A life with no consolation
Inconsistent dedication
Incompetent solutions
A problem
That can be solved by death
A painful trial
With no end
Deluded your ashes had
Turned to dust
Yet plagued till dawn
Beginning from dusk
Demons taking over 
 the Devil is over my shoulder
As flames begins to rise
My heart becomes colder
Evil
A Devilish act
Evil
From this horror I can't go back
No prayers
No signs of hope
No better tomorrow
Allowing me to cope
You gave so much
 I gave nothing in return
No place to call home
I'll forever wander alone
In my dreams it's you I see
But when I wake
You're not here with me
To be forgiven
Is all that I ask
To be forgotten
Let's kill the past
No concern whether I live or die
I have no more fight to continue with life
A sad song
For all I've done
A sad song
Will you care
When I'm fucking gone
I can't help but feel this way
I need to escape this pain
I am plagued by the memories
Scorned by this fate
I beg  plead
For the Devil to take my soul
Any action
As long as it takes me home
All hopes are no more
I'm shamed  alone
All thoughts are no more
I'm cursed  alone
I've become everything I hate
A ghost of my past
I only have myself to blame
Apathy to agony
I'll watch these chapters burn
Until there's nothing left of me
A false sense of hope
Impaired motivation
Soon I'll be alone
To drown in my own desecration
My insincerity is disgusting
I've taken all but given nothing
I'm haunted
 it enters my dreams to call me out
Memories turned nightmares
How bad I'd love to cut them out
Mistakes sliced deep
Deep scars into my mind
Punished for my failures
I try  bleed for human kind
I've sold my soul to the slime
Gods of the underworld
No salvation I'm way passed any hope
Embrace my punishment
Eternal suffering
In this life I'm a slave to my mistakes
I'll never seize to suffer
Until I'm in my grave
But then I'll dwell in the bane
A damned soul burning in the flames
Chambers of eternal punishment 
Torture apathy pain
Depression agony  hate
In Hell it never ends
Despair prolongs
Even when I'm fucking dead
Praying for change
Yet remaining the same
Chambers of eternal punishment
Demons haunting in
One day we meet one day we forget 
Don't mind the absence of faceless hearts 
There ain't no power to tear friends apart
Friends stand hand in hand 
The answer my friend
Afraid to be deceived again 
We got to believe in the faith of friends 
It's hard to find a friend to trust 
But easier than leaving a friend we lost
Friends stand hand in hand 
The answer my friend
One more one less  No need to cry 
At the end of the road  A new path's in sight 
One more one less  No need to cry 
If hope's gonna live  In terms like goodbye
Voice We have to rely on the meaning of friends 
Don't believe in those who pretend 
Ev'ry single friend is a priceless gift 
And better than dozens of liars  no matter if 
 One more  one less
Fool for the nightlife
and the glory of a winner's fame
card on the table
take your place and play your game
Down and out  keep on rollin' the dice
call yourself a gambler
think you never lose a game
Down and out  you believe in your eyes
you are just a toy in a silly game
You need the nightlife
only destiny will show the way
shade and illusion
make you blind to play that game
Down and out  keep on rollin' the dice
call yourself a gambler
think you never lose a game
Down and out  you believe in your eyes
you are just a toy in a silly game
Down and out  you're deceiving the dice
still you are a gambler
in your dreams you win the game
Down and out  if you don't realize
no one will remember none will know your name
Heart on fire  she could be anyone
I'd like to tell a tale of little Any None
She felt like you and me
One titlepage of those blinding eyes
And she got lost
No fear  the smiling face appears in her dreams
So near  the photographs still shine on
It was unreal
She bevlieved to see the chosen one
She won't see  cheating faces made her blind
Heart on fire
She couldn't stand to share
Her dream came true with a gun in her hand
For a tick of time
It was unreal
She bevlieved to see the chosen one
She won't see  cheating faces made her blind
Heart on fire
Heart on fire  her name was Any None
It hit her hard to see and realize
She'd never get in touch
Maybe one day beyond now
It was unreal
She bevlieved to see the chosen one
She won't see  cheating faces made her blind
Heart on fire
Lonely children they cry out of the dark
but why don't we hear
that's spilled in a war
And we get used of terror in here
we only close our eyes
All our stories and lies
of fairess and love I'm tired to hear
words and numbers we write in letters of blood
that shine on the wall
This world is full of horror and fear
why do we close our eyes
White against yellow red against black
left against right all fight
Hunger war and death are daily news
people suffer in neverending cries
All you children stop cryin' get out of the dark
Nevermore would you run and loose again
your apin will fade away get out of the dark
Don't look behind you ain't gonna stop you
a new generation is born
Children stop cry  out of the dark
pain fade away  out of the dark
don't look behind you
Well it takes it's toll this reality
it knocks you down and you get up to fall again
you don't know how I don't know why
the circle has made it's turn
than you end where you begin
You're ill confused
you've lost to feel for all that's real
you're ill confused
you've lost to feel
There is no time the words have run dry
but hey so don't fight against me but with me
I will help you
You're ill confused
you've lost to feel for all that's real
you're ill confused
you've lost to feel
Afraid to be alone alone in the dark
without someones guiding hand
afraid to go out on the street
and live on the edge  to risk your life
Lightning strikes the night a thunder is rising
from the sky above  you feel the sweat drop down
you can't sleep it's like every night
It's a nightmare  your nightmare tonight
It's a nightmare
It's a nightmare  your nightmare tonight
Every night is the same you count the bell tolls
till it's 12 midnight  shadows on the wall
showing you the man with the mask
It's a nightmare  your nightmare tonight
It's a nightmare
It's a nightmare  your nightmare tonight
Liar liar thats what they say what you are
no one behind in the story you told
no one believed that you're not guilty
the years they pass by you're awaiting the end
someday you know they'll come to take you
oh god please help I'm to young for your heaven
oh god please help me now
You don't know when your time has come
sit and wait for the end
still a key opens up your door
and the priest is your only friend
Sometimes I remember those days of joy
and I wish I had the power to turn back the time
Awaiting awaiting the dark
Awaiting awaiting the dark
Sometimes I had dreamt of these days of pain
now I'm here I was sentenced to pay with my life
Awaiting awaiting the dark
Awaiting awaiting the dark
Here in court we made up our minds
in the name of justice and law
the judgement is passed by the truth
think of it and take the time to repent
now it's time to die time to die time to die 
I'm here in the darkness
the light of life I can see
a senseless decision
hope you enjoy my dying
Awaiting awaiting the dark
Awaiting awaiting the dark
Lost in the glare of the fame
I stand every night
on stage and I'm searchin' for myself
I'd lose control  and you too
I'm sorry  now and forever
I'll take it if you want to go
But deep inside I'm lookin' for a home
a place for you and me
where we're together all the time
With you  I wana be 'till the end
Hey babe  I'm comin' home tonight
When I'm coming home it's just some old hotel
in an unknown town
my heart is so empty my mind's blow away
Another day  changing feelings
my desire for your love and affection
turned and repressed but only for a little while
But deep inside I'm lookin' for a home
a place for you and me
where we're together all the time
With you  I wana be 'till the end
Hey babe  I'm comin' home tonight
This way of life I had to choose for a long time
but I'm comin' home tonight
This way of life I had to choose for a long time
performance of glory standing in the glaring
spotlight of a dream that does not exist
And then I feel great void in my body when
For you I wanna sing the song
For you  I fight
With you  I die
For you  I sing the song
and I'm coming home
Good times I had
and the point where I'm standing alone
has passed long ago
and it makes me happy to say
I love you
You and I we stand side by side
you'd catch me if I'd fall down
the dream is over my heart beat frenziedly
and I'm happy when I'm comin' home
Dead man's daily routine
pushing my back to the wall
bones to dust in the machine
the boss man's ritual
But how the tables turn now
eye kept on the dawn
forget about my troubles
and I get it on
Neon  beggars  they dance
while I just burn down the town
take the glass and take my chance
then just drink it down
But how the tables turn now
eye kept on the dawn
forget about my troubles
and I get it on
Twelve bottles  I keep it tight
As wisdom brutally teaches
Pacing back and forth again and again
Just searching for an end
Panic wave chaos showers
Sickening stench of man gone sour
Laughing at us in our face we're disgraced
and then we're all erased
Persevere  Holding out  Make it end
Giving in  Giving up  Let it end
Why is it infinite
The evil that revolves around our universe
The always changing never changing
Why is it infinite
The evil that revolves around our universe
The always changing never changing
Nothing changes
Pressure point burning rage
No turning back no release from this cage
One man calls the other one a liar
There's fire escalating higher 
Endless wars lost causes
Only letting up for brief pauses
Time repeats this circle of madness
Repetition of constant sadness
Persevere  Holding out  Make it end
Giving in  Giving up  Let it end
Why is it infinite
The evil that revolves around our universe
The always changing never changing
Why is it infinite
The evil 
The always changing never changing
Nothing changes
Analyze  Cut to shreds
Overweight yet underfed
Food for thought no answer to our questions
Save your breath  Waste no words
Undescript it's so absurd
Wisdom sits beyond our meager minds
Infinite  
Projected through my mind's eye
Brilliant light blinding sight burning
Running from the vile
Evil force fight it off must resist
Blasting of my soul I lay sleeping body cold
Limbo for all time unless I can find my way
Out of  Out of body out of mind
Out of  Out of body in my mind
Wicked is the power hunting me the spirits prey
Facing off to lay claim
Time could soon run out for me
Warring with the demon
Vicious cries sinful eyes crave what's mine
Blasting of my soul I lay sleeping body cold
Limbo for all time unless I can find my way
Out of  Out of body out of mind
Out of  Out of body in my mind
Drift from my world to the other
Demon screaming out for me
Everything is gone now
Won't get back can't get back never
There's no life there's no death
Just hell
Blasting of my soul I lay sleeping body cold
Limbo for all time unless I can find my way
Out of  Out of body out of mind
Out of  Out of body in my mind
Out of mind
In my mind
Out of body
Thrust from my world to the other
Lost and gone forever in my hell
My hell
Numbing your mind to the pain
You broke the rule the payment's cruel
Selfish road you paved the way
Hiding in your fantasy it's easier to lie
The choice you made could kill
You're just one lonely victim
A wasted life
Don't you feel as if your walls fall in
The way you live could put you underground
Step by step by step
Surviving hanging by a thread
Step by step by step
It's time to turn the table
Step by step by step
Society's not done with you
Step by step by step
It just gets worse until you  pull through
Rejected lost in a daze
It's all so cold do as you're told
Hit your knees now start to pray
Dream about a time before securely locked away
Within your heart is the key
If you don't open up then
You'll lose your life
Don't you feel as if your walls fall in
The way you live could put you underground
Step by step by step
Surviving hanging by a thread
Step by step by step
It's time to turn the table
Step by step by step
Society's not done with you
Step by step by step
It just gets worse until you  pull through
Filled your head with dreams that died
Just couldn't get no higher
Your luck's run out the thread has snapped
A cold depressing end 
Don't you feel as if your walls fall in
The way you live could put you underground
Step by step by step
Surviving hanging by a thread
Step by step by step
It's time to turn the table
Step by step by step
Society's not done with you
Step by step by step
It just don't stop
Step by step by step
Don't try to run before you walk
Step by step by step
Do it for yourself kid
Step by step by step
It's just the way you have to learn
Step by step by step
Step by step by step by step
Step by step by step by step
Step by step by step by step
Step by step by step by step
Ideals pounded what's wrong is right
Churches founded with heaven in sight
Do unto them as they tell you to
How can the children believe this is true
Burn our thoughts they can change our minds
Hear pathetic lies
Put to end all the empty cries
Now it's time for eye for I
Faith decided out of the womb
Slapped into life and then slapped in your tomb
When will it end
When will the lying stop
Burn our thoughts they can change our minds
Hear pathetic lies
Put to end all the empty cries
Now it's Eye for I
Hate Churning your face consumed by fear
Unreal illusion of a perfect world
Twist into form the true abyss
Crushed in the palm of fate's hands
Eyes stare with empty but evil glances
Children with nothing in mind but to breathe
Twist it to form 
Twisting to form 
Twisted to form 
Twist me to form then they 
Burn my thoughts then they change my mind
Tell pathetic lies
Put to end all my empty cries
Now it's eye for I
Hate Churning your face consumed by fear
Unreal illusion of a perfect world
Twist into form the true abyss
Crushed in the palm of fate's hands
Hate Churning your face consumed by fear
Unreal illusion of a perfect world
Twist into form the true abyss
Crushed in the palm of fate's hands
We've always been told to stand up tall
Guard the nation
This killing force that we have made what for
I am sickened by this attitude that plagues
The Mother Earth
It always seems that we're all fighting
We don't know what it's worth
Close the door as they beg for more
Children cry as they're left to die
See the tears running down their faces
See compassion is at end
Mother Earth is crying
Rest in peace Peace
Who can you believe It's never what it seems
Feel the anger
We will
I am saddened by this selfishness and Who cares
Attitude
Put down your arms and stop this fighting
Save our Mother Earth
Close your eyes say your last goodbyes
Selfdestruct we've run out of luck
See the lights turn to darkness
Realize there is no hope
The human race is dying
Rest in peace Peace
Desperate  Is what we've all become
Helpless  There's nowhere left to run
Crushing  The spirit of mankind
Forbidding  What's yet to come
We've always been told to stand up tall
Guard the nation
This killing force that we have made what for
I am sickened by this attitude that plagues
The Mother Earth
It always seems that we're all fighting
We don't know what it's worth
Who will drop the curtain
Who will end Earth's history
No more Happy ever after
Rest in peace Peace
Rest in peace 
Witness to the crying of the poor I can't relate
Don't tell me I won't know just leave me be
Every time a page is turned
Every time a channel's switched I look away
Washing off my dirty hands
If I don't want to understand why should I
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away tossed away
Don't bother me I'm dreaming just le me sleep
Every time a page is turned
Every time a channel's switched I look away
Washing off my dirty hands
If I don't want to understand why should I
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away tossed away
Disgusting Revolting They sicken me
Send them somewhere out of sight away from us
Don't say I didn't warn you just wait and see
Every time a page is turned
Every time a channel's switched I look away
Washing off my dirty hands
If I don't want to understand why should I
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away tossed away 
Pain and hurting of diseased
Taking life by ill dispose
Shunned and tossed away tossed away
Regression Progressive downfall
Grabbing what's there and still wanting it all
On words they fall
Obsession Religious belief
Worshipped on Sunday forgotten all week
One foot in Hell
Feeling they're touched by the Lord
But seeing no wrong
Walking the crooked straight line
Closing of minds to these innocent crimes
Now they're deaf dumb and blind
One foot in Hell
Wretches This pitiful man
Preaching and teaching with cross in hand
On words he falls
Into His final mistake
This fool was fooled it was all give and take
One foot in Hell
Turning the pages of writing it falls into place
A puzzle of words
Attempting to fear the Commandments they hear
Now they're deaf dumb and blind
I look to the Heavens and call the Lord's name
Am I wasting away on spirits of myth
Am I questioning the Lord's prayer
Help me Lord
God help me  
Regression Progressive downfall
Grabbing what's there and still wanting it all
On words they fall
Obsession Religious belief
Worshipped on Sunday forgotten all week
One foot in Hell
Feeling they're touched by the Lord
But seeing no wrong
Walking the crooked straight line
Closing of minds to these innocent crimes
Show me the way  Point to the light
Is there a Heaven after I die
What is a truth  Where does it lie
Give me the answer
Bare my soul  Naked and cold
End confusion shed my last tear
Take me Lord  Open your Gates
End my deep sorrow
One foot in Hell
Who's answering the bell

die i will destroy you
so die you've forfeited your life

The Rainbow in the Dark
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
It was cold  lost my hold
To the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow in the Dark
Just a Rainbow in the Dark
Do your demons  well do they ever let you go
When you've tried  do they hide  deep inside
Is it someone that you know
We're a lie  you and I
We're words without a rhyme
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow in the Dark
Just a Rainbow in the Dark
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic  feel it dancing in the air
But it's fear  and you'll hear
It calling you beware
No sign of the morning coming
No sight of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow
Just a Rainbow in the Dark
Youre a Rainbow in the Dark
Just a Rainbow in the Dark
A Rainbow in the Dark
No sign of the morning
Youre a Rainbow in the Dark
I see youre all youre all youre all a Rainbow
Youre a Rainbow in the Dark
Thank you
Thank you
Good night
The old ones speak of winter
The young ones praise the sun
And time just slips away
Running into nowhere
Turning like a wheel
And a year becomes a day
Whenever you dream
That's when you fly
So here is a dream
For just you and I
We'll find the Sacred Heart
Somewhere bleeding in the night
Look to the light
Got to find the Sacred Heart
Here we see the wizard
Staring through the glass
And he's looking right at you
You can see tomorrow
The answer and the lie
And the things you've got to do
Find the Sacred Heart
Look to the light
Oh sometimes you never fall
And ah  You're the lucky one
But oh  Sometimes you want it all
You've got to reach for the sun
And find the Sacred Heart
its Somewhere bleeding in the night
Oh look out for the light the light
Find the Sacred Heart
Its bleeding in the night
You fight to kill the dragon
And bargain with the beast
Then you sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow
But you never leave the ground
Still you don't know why
Whenever you dream
You're holding the key
It opens the door
To let you be free
And find the Sacred Heart
its somewhere bleeding in the night
Look tor the light
Got to find the Sacred Heart
Run along the rainbow
Before it turns to black
Attack
Youre the last in
Youre the last in
Youre the last in
Youre the last in
You got to reach for the sun
Youve got to find the Sacred Heart
Someone told me I would never be free
The way you are is way you'll always be
But it's all wrong
There's Time To Burn
And hurt is on the pleasure wheel
But you can't hurt if you can't feel
And you can feel  theres something to learn
And you've got Time To Burn
Time To Burn
Youve been lost inside a pounding heart
Waiting for the game to start
But you won't play  you've so much to learn
Like you never say never
We'll live forever
And you've got Time To Burn
Time To Burn
When the wolf is loose in the city
The the city will fight to survive
You can hide in the streets of the city
But no one will care
No one will know you're alive
Youve Time To Burn
Now someone told me I would never be free
The way you are is where you'll always be
But it's all wrong
Just never say never
We're gonna live forever
Cause you've got Time To Burn
Time To Burn
Time To Burn
Time To Burn
Fire
Time To Burn
Youve got Time To Burn
Rock and roll
It was starting to rain
On the night that they first decided
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they ran away
They were found in the dark
But they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door  bang
She was meant to be wild
He was nearly a child
But they only could feel each other
They were paper and fire
Angel and liar
The devil of one another
Then they were thrown to the ground
With a terrible sound
Just like somebody slammed a heart
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Without a friend
But you got Rock 'N' Roll
You got Rock and Roll
All right Rock And Roll
At the end of a dream
If you know what I mean
When the mist just starts to clear
In a similar way
At the end of the day
I can feel the sound of writing on the wall
It cries for you
Its the least that you can do
Like a spiral thats on the wind
I can hear it screaming in the air
Long live Rock and Roll
Long live Rock n Roll
Long live Rock and Roll
Long live Rock n Roll
Yes Rock n Roll
Long live Rock and Roll
Long live Rock n Roll
Long live Rock and Roll
Long live Rock n Roll
I'm a wheel a wheel
I can roll I can feel
And you can't stop me turning
I'm the sun the sun
I can move I can run
You'll never stop me burning
Get down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again
I'm the man on the silver mountain
The man on the silver mountain
Get down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me make me holy again
The man on the silver mountain
The man on the silver mountain
In the man on the mountain
The man on the silver mountain
Well Im the man Im the man Im the man
Ill give my hand Ill give you my hand
And for you heres my hand
Well go way to the mountain
Youre the man youre the man youre all the man
Were all were all were all were all the man
It was starting to rain
On the night that they cried forever
It was blinding with snow
On the night that they screamed goodbye
They were lost in the dark
And they never returned
Just like somebody slammed the door  bang
Alone again
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Without a friend
It was starting to rain
On the night that they met
It was blinding with snow
On the night we let them go go go go
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Alone again
Rock 'N' Roll Children
Without a friend
But you got Rock n Roll
Long live Rock n Roll
Long live Rock n Roll
Long live Rock n Roll
For you this song is called WE ROCK
You watch their faces
And you'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing
They leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Just penetrates your mind
Sail on sing a song carry on
Cause We Rock We Rock We Rock We Rock
We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same
Just got a different name
Too many voices
All giving choices
If we listen they will say
We can find the way
Sail on sing a song carry on
We Rock We Rock We Rock We Rock
We Rock We Rock We Rock We Rock
We Rock
We Rock We Rock We Rock
Watch their faces
You'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing
They leave but still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Just penetrates your mind
Sail on sing a song carry on
We Rock We Rock We Rock We Rock
We Rock We Rock We Rock
Ride out  stand and shout  carry on
Sail on  sing your song  carry on
We Rock
What do you do
We Rock
We Rock
We Rock
We Rock
We Rock
We Rock
You Rock
You Rock
You Rock
We Rock
Thank you
Thank you
We love you
GoodnightWander in darkness and places unknown
Find destination zero
Deep down on your own alone
From south of Heaven to north gates of Hell
Kaleidoscope of your own missing self
Destination zero
Never say never you'll get your way home
From south of Heaven
From south of Heaven
Embrace the horror and the lie remains the same
This brutal planet commits suicide again
Trumpets will sound the soundtrack of death
Thunders and storms
Dimensions higher
Planet reforms
Cosmos on fire
It's time to sell big news catastrophe of world
Deadeye disciples preaching vacant words of hope
What's to be done will be done no parole
Thunders and storms
Apocalyptic psychostorm  The skies are bleeding
Unleash the fury of the gods
Lost in illusions fear is the key
Bloodvirus souls hypnotized
Land of confusion dying new breed
Embrace the horror of reality
Blinded by ambition
Selfgreed's on a mission
Balance on a razorblade
Tears of the angels choirs of the dead
When life and death will collide
Our revolution twisting insane
Embrace the sickness of it all
Out of the shadows
Out of the shadows
Each time you look in your own eyes
The mirror's bleeding
Each tear another hero dies
Always blinded by your fears
Never wanted to tame that power
Burning up your savage heart
Unleash the beast that calls you night and day
Aware of all the things you may embrace
Tame the Devil inside
Do you have the guts to take your darkest ride
Free the Devil inside
Trap the Devil inside
Snake will keep on crawling never look behind
Kill the Devil inside
Sow the seeds of chaos find your piece 'o mind
Salvation Inc
Find lies and truth on mystic path
There's no way out no
Unleash the beast
Tame the Devil inside
Tame the Devil inside
Too late for regrets
A cosmic reset
Oppression regression brutalized inspiration
Awakened human parasite
disorder beholder erase 'em all game over
It's resurrection suicide
It's a game of symmetry neutral balanced destiny
A brave new life AD  EVOLUTION
Oppression
Oppression
Just from those moments in life we all fear
But when the ultimate end's closing near
And then it's you recollect
The love we never find moments we leave behind
The simple things that keep us separated
Our ego makes us blind degenerated
WE'RE BLIND
DECLINED
Oh we can change all this shit if we try
It is more than you and me gotta try
Just to fall with our pride
The love we never find
WE'RE BLIND
The love we never find
WE'RE BLIND
Faces and the secrets beneath wicked
Surface and the lies in the eyes
I will be crawling under that smile
No one can hide from his guilts
I'll be calling you at nights
I will be crawling in your dreams
I hear you creeping cannot be dreaming
Oh no
Nightmare despair on and on
Oneiric storm your twilight zone
Where will you turn for your sins
Search deep within I'm under your skin
Secrets inner demons make your nights
Sleepless still the lies in your eyes
I will be crawling under your pride
You cannot hide from your sins
I hear you calling my name
I'm here to ease away your pain
Oh no
Nightmare despair
Nightmare despair
In the name o' power
In the zero hour
Realize your parody
Destination nowhere
Run amok it's over
Meet the punisher new me
Angels of mercy
Divine irony
Enemies kneel to the
Violent new me
There is no escaping zone
Yourself your life your own
Meet the harvestlord new me
Angels of mercy
Angels of mercy
Steel and fire
Through the wind and the rain
Wheel monster freeway riots
Streets are marked with their name
Pride and glory
Through generations and time
Freedom seals their story
it's ultimate speed divine
I wanna make things come my own way
I aim to see my dreams come true
Heaven can wait I'll die another day
Just leave me be your king of fools
Have no boundaries
destination unknown
Wanna rest my piece oh
Somewhere I could call home
Never followed your nowhere plan
Listen to me you son of a gun
Just let it be
Live and let die
I wanna see things come my own way
I aim to make my dreams
Ever alone
Ever alone
Myself alone
Ever alone
Rock is bleeding from my eyes
Blood brothers metally insane
It's rock until we fall our metal horror show
Highway to Hell with Devil's train
Saint's and sinners nonbelievers
A pure steel gallery of world
Metal action chain reaction
It's primal instinct rock n' growl
One music one nation blood  ROCK N GROWL
One will united we stand  ROCK N GROWL
It's made in Hell or brought from Heaven
The world's a stage we plug and play
Faults we make remain the same
Can't realize rock who's to blame
Life's a game we have to play
Can't realize rock 'fore we bleed
Rock n' growl
One music
Out where the river broke
The bloodwood and the desert oak
Holden wrecks and boiling diesels
Steam in forty five degrees
The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent now
To pay our share
Four wheels scare the cockatoos
From Kintore East to Yuendemu
The western desert lives and breathes
In forty five degrees
The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent now
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
We're gonna give it back
How can we dance when our earth is turning
here even the wind destroys bones
time turns into space bones ache
drawn out like an ache bones space
it smelled like slow death bones ache
to the pit where we twist and cringe bones ache
huddled away from the daylight pale and white
for its the same ragged tangle of fears
the same strange sense of aimlessness
that knot of rage scoured the floor of the skull
silent as the drift of death
the cracks down the sides of reality
to sweat you in your bed a memory of water
somewhere towards the end
it is slow and cold
in the sludge of human misery
empty of dreams burning with tension
but its early here at the end
the heart dragging and
the chill of old silver
right at the end of the world
clawing the bottom of my lungs
at the corners of perception
like ragged glass over nerves
you will have to claw it from them
crushing life into the methane
watch the old earth ebb away
a sound like the universe apart
like the sorrow of a dream
this place is for people who like the way down
we are the hollow men leaning together
old men wringing our minds of thought
the world never had so many moving parts
that sought form
there is something about this place
it seduces me
sagged in ruin a rope around my neck
around my feet like concrete it drains away
that drug that final moment like concrete
the skeleton of life that drug like concrete
we have been sucking up the vapours for aeons
many are the hands that dig my grave tonight
the slow dark sludge melted down and solidified
full of poison insanity and nightmares
inside nothing outside emptiness
it mothers demons that move
the grace of addiction
tuned to a dead channel in search of a new womb
like something hauled from dreams and abandoned
the mind drinks less and less
the universal rubble nothing left to rot
abandoned and formless
there are no mountains to make them cower
end it burn it nothing is clean
burn it end it it feeds on silence
an anchor drawing us to oblivion and the bones
a cancerous day nothing to guide
even time decays like a razor through creation
a fever dream or a brooding advanced decay
the edges failed every fragment rushed away
thrown around the centrifuge of space
disintegrating set of cells disintegrate space
woven back together with chemical thread
cord which makes us live
branches run down with bones of ancient stone
and roots grow up with the weight of the air
interminable ennui
a ragged cascade of neurons edging out
the roots were so shallow once free to stagnate
decay non being urging death
roots grow down with ancient stone
time passed unused bestial and lonely
a gaunt catalogue of bones and hollows
roots grow up with ancient stone
interminable ennui
branches run down with bones of air
cascading neurons
urging death decay and non being
stagnant relics
free to suck the marrow of time or nothing
sublime intoxication
sublime intoxication
when did the future become a threat
the past has been destroyed
the war is not meant to be won
all history turns to plastic
scraped clean and reinscribed
some things are so corrupt that
the only clean act is nihilism
as we slip and disintegrate
layer by layer
if we dont build we must burn
civilisation is the infection
where we revere the sticky spoor of blood
these are brutal timesReign
In the day of a working class
A day lasting eternity
Can we surpass
Avoid the crash
The humble slave our destiny
This vicious cycle of the social struggle
Ends meat is a losing battle
When our skills are replaced by a machine
Disregard us
Capitalize on our dreams
Decay under the strain
Class war will reign
Decay under the strain
Class war will reign
Disappearing in the face of modern industry
Famine hardship seemed so far from me
Unable to exist among our own class
Fighting to breathe
We sink so fast
Our own hardship is another's prosperity
Forced to rebel for a new beginning
To become more then this commodity
Overcome and surpass this living hell
Decay under the strain
Class war will reign
Decay under the strain
Class war will reign
We sink so fast
Try to remember your better days
Don't be distracted by your life laid to waste
All the years of fighting and trying
A strange feeling washes through our hearts
Try to forget the bad days
All regrets fade away
And all the years just pass us by
The warmth fills our dying hearts
Last goodbye
We want it all we want to breathe
But do we need one last moment
To help us feel content
We had it all had to see
But did we need one last moment
To help us feel content
Do you feel content
Hearing the pleading in drastic measures
We never thought minutes could be so treasured
I can feel desire laid to waste
I couldn't be wrong
I can hear the cries in the air
I can hear you cry in the air
And I'm feeling content
Burn for me extinguished flame may never return
Burn to strife burn until it's made to light
Our warmth so counterfeit
Our life of our blood so long desolate
Fallen as far as the king to the slave
Give up the world but accept the grave
Never forget the fire that burns
Never forget the fire
We measure our worth like meat on the scale
Compare it to others we'll always fail
Our worth is defined by the pain by the struggle
By the struggle we live to fight
Burn for me extinguished flame may never return
Burn for strife burn until it's made light
Our wake up call is set to genocide
Our wake up call is set to genocide
Tip toe around the truth lips sealed
Recruiting numbers recruiting
The hopeless the hurt
I will not allow this controlling to persist
How long till it blows up in your fucking face
Your afterlife is a long ladder
Save your soul
But can you sleep with the watchful eyes on you
Save your soul
The people closest to you
Save your soul
Are now you're biggest threat
Our wake up call is set to genocide
Our wake up call is set to genocide
Our misled ways will kill us all
Our misled ways will kill us all
Now enlightenment is within you
The sacrifice will save your soul
The sacrifice will keep you pure
Close your eyes and let go
The sacrifice will save your soul
The sacrifice will keep you pure
Let go
You can't escape
Accept the strength and rise from death
Wake up sleeper live again
Break the chains of objective creeds
Drown in an ocean of conformity
We are the people who have become idle
The masochists seeking bridles
We are the people who have become idle
And willing to make the descent
Disobey your masters make then fear and tremble
Come anarchy come ruin
No longer passive in social servitude
Come anarchy come ruin
As we follow this path of destruction
As we wander this world without function
Our individuality has been choked under foot
Our idea of freedom has been surrendered
For the material possession that drives us
The very thing that controls us
Ideas of freedom have been surrendered
See half the story
What you want to believe
Shadow the facts and wreak havoc
Corruption means nothing without empathy
Defeating force feeding continuing to destroy
Limitless gain infinite pain
Our inability to change
Respect honor do onto others
Shameful words lead to shameful acts
But they shall hide the facts
Time to fall
To your knees
Time to fall it's time to fall
To your knees and beg for mercy
Shadow the facts and wreak havoc
Sorrow will find you
Will we ever believe we're worth more
More than what we've become
Save yourself
Will we ever take the chances we've been given
Will we ever taste the lives we've been living
Will we ever see the lies they've been feeding
Will we ever see the pain we've been dealing
Innocence wasted look at what we've all become
Prisoners
Could you ever believe
We are more than just war
Could you ever believe
Prisoner of hatred
Save yourself
Crossing lines that we've never drawn
I won't take this I will fight this
The faults are on both sides
Not just in the knives held to our throats
No more pain no more hate
All that we've lost we can't forget
There's nowhere let to run
Cause this is war
This is war
Prisoner
Will we ever see the lies that we're spoon fed
Prisoner
Will we ever see past the guns held to our heads
Save yourself
Look what we've all become
Could you ever believe
Now its ending look what we've lost
Now its over what have we gained
Prisoner
Time to kill
Kill the lights
All the time in the world
Take our fill
Unconsciousness
This stillness of what's left is damaging
The brightness still filled our eyes
Outlasting repetition confines
Relieving hopelessness to find broken
Staring at the TV screen
Hurting dealing with what we've just seen
We read on as our hearts grow colder
The weight of it all rests on our shoulders
Helpless
We stand alone
Helpless
As we grow cold
We'll fight alone
Helpless
To right the wrongs
We'll take our fill
We're decomposing
Hopeless with the tide
But what's left in this unconsciousness
Judgement day is creeping closer
Are we willing to die
No
The sky is falling
Our freedom's falling
For a better world
They're tightening the economic noose
While they rape us
It's time to open our eyes
Stop sucking down the lies
Our country's taken by the throat
Who's gonna think for a thoughtless nation
Our leaders can't even think for themselves
There's a leak in this democracy
When everybody's voting out of fear
For the fear
The sky will open
Are we willing to die
While they bleed us dry
Everywhere I look
We're turning for the worse
I see the closing is near
We're fucking doomed by our own admission
What can we do
What can we say
For the fear
We're taken
We bleed out
For the fear
We're choking
Suffering
For the fear
Lives taken
Lives ending
For the fear
Just keep your fucking mouth shut
Or you deserve to die
We're destined to die
Time and time again
We're at the bottom on the losing end
I don't mind not making a cent
As long as there's not a cent to be made
Take your hands out of my fucking pocket
This revenge burns deep in me
This revenge lives in me
Memories suppressed from years ago
Fires rising through the cracks
Learning everyday just a little more
These fucking lost cries flood back
This disgust for the human race why I despise
I have to ride myself of this
Feeling nothing but hatred for you and I
This revenge is raging inside of me
This revenge burns in me
Its burning me
All this time feeling less than zero
The last time you breathe
This burn in my veins
This raging
Now I know why I have no love for no one
Why I don't let a soul know the real me
I blame you for everything that we become
I'm going down fast but I'm taking you
The fuck with me
This revenge burns deep in me
Has won a space in our hearts
By the law of infinite fear
It kills beauty and joy
It shouldn't but it does when we let in
In the depths of our souls we confess the sin
Yes no
No the denial of what is lost
Yes when you value the cost
Time will destroy
To the grasp of breath
Darkened and grey
The wrinkled hands betray
Time of pleasure
For scorn and deceived
Who were forced to their knees
Pleasure when souls are released
Where the world end the world begins
When all battles swallowing fire
Repeats its place upon earth anger
Fury burning desire
It makes you worthy of pain
Hatred hatred
Life death
It is when you try to drown your soul
That she sparkles the most
Time of pleasure
For scorn and deceived
Who were forced to their knees
Pleasure when souls are released
Listen to the sound
They call from beyond
Our souls leave the ground
The unknown has begun
To reveal its secrets
Soon we will see
Realise mortality
In the depths of infinity
March down the line of existence
One by one into the depths we fall
Even when we see our lives expire
March march march down the line of existence
If you dare to break the silence
If you speak your name aloud
If your standard bows against the winds
You will be swallowed by the crowd
Hatred hatred
White black
Which is mirror to your own deep down
Which is worn as disguise
Time will destroy
To the grasp of breath
Darkened and grey
Time of pleasure
For scorn and deceived
Who were forced to their knees
Pleasure when souls are released
Where the world ends silence begins
The day has passed like nothing's done
The sleepwalk of the awake nothing's wrong
I see things happening right in front of me
I live to see I live to taste
The waste of things you break
Like nothing's wrong
I can always find you we are not equal you see
I can always find you where ever you may be
Because I want to touch you
Caress your twisted mind
To take you through the dark forest
Trees whisper of wiser generations
Listen to the silence
Don't ride failure or success
Ride the storms that rush in your head
The flames from your darkened eyes
I want to touch you
Caress your twisted mind
Leather you stretch on your face
Shows the feeling you have inside
Don't get me wrong leather is nice and smooth
But it will crumble in time not in time
Too late
Like nothing's wrong
I can always find you we are not equal you see
I can always find you where ever you may be
Because I want to touch you
Caress your twisted mind
To take you through the dark forest
Trees whisper of wiser generations
An old man at the shore of his life
In desperation and fear he lies
The truth he has tried to conceal
In his mind before his flesh will part
He was caught in the web of temptation
That norns had woven for him
He had chosen the faddish path of violence
And sacrifice for ancient gods belief
He was one of the proud
He was violence unleashed
Bend to his will of power
Or join the hordes of deceased
Now he pities himself for his doings
Told by Christ that his motive were wrong
How come he had tread the evil path
While he felt his willpower strong
At the centre of conscience
My fear stares at me
White rimmed eyes ceremonial mask
No human face what I see
Stranded
I pay homage to the tower of flesh
While my spirit roams free
He was one of the proud
He was violence unleashed
Bend to his will of power
Or join the hordes of deceased
Enter now the kingdom of Nastrond
Where the strand of corpses lie
Enlaced to the boundaries of hope
In eternity captured souls cry
He was one of the proud
He was violence unleashed
Bend to his will of power
Or join the hordes of deceased
When the powers of existence
Gazed furious in me
White rimmed eyes ceremonial mask
I fear the shape that I see
Stranded
True repentance when your soul dies
With all manner of those who died in bed
He was one of the proud
He was violence unleashed
Bend to his will of power
Or join the hordes of deceased
Inglorious creator of the primordial earth
God of the temple of tears
unleash the hell from the abyss
The sordidness will gobern the earth
You wander on the edge of the void
destined to defeat the skies
you have sullied the sanctuary of blood
lord of dishonorable sepulchers
king of the black cript of pragmatism
guardian of the spiritual beliefs
Seeds of darkness planted in the chasm
cultivated between pagan rites
The wind crawl the stench of the death deity
Apsu take my voice my will
spread the truth across humanity
Lord of the great twelve kingdoms
bless me with the breath of the eternal life
by fire or by sword  darkness light my way
bring me the head of God
The wind crawl the stench of the death deity
Can you feel that stench
Is the human life their bodies rot slow in time
Oh Shamash lord show me the path
The real sense of the human's life
Slaves of hope blinded and weak
Embraced the torment and agony
Arrogant and feeble pathetic error of the gods
Ungrateful universal disgrace unworthy animal
Trapped in the black veil of the night
Beholding the rupture of his dark sky
Indelible immortal
Queen of the abyss
No order no blame no glare
Ancient inhabitant of a sterile land
Smilingly with contempt to the earth
His might is so above as below
An evil older than men
And more extensive than the universe
Wake up and take your crown mother of the depths
Show me the secrets of the ancient times
Give me the will give me your throne
An evil older than men
And more extensive than the universe
The clouds are moving in their whimsical dances
The wind sings an old song of war
The temple is shining between oil lamps
Prayers are flowing into the air
The vault in heaven is illuminated by the stars
The birds disappeared from the dead sky
Megaliths are raised to the firmament
Offerings are piled on the altar stone
Full of sculpted symbols of ancestral gods
It's stone glow under the silvery moon
Ivy bare walls keep out the enemy
Shamash is awaiting me in his golden throne
Terror is made for the slave
The glory accompany to the brave
Empty man lacking courage
New inhabitant of an unmarked grave
Forever the shame will pursue you
Forgotten to the eyes of the real gods
The path of the just is stained with blood
You march with bare feet on thorns
You can hear the sounds of the horns of war
The dead hands of religion sterilize the wisdom
Blinded by the faith for a puny god
Glorious ability to enslave a depraved animal
Through immaculate awareness
Redemptor of puritans proclaimers of selfdeceit
Orators of fraud with hypocritical complacency
Under the yoke of a fruitless falsehood
Commanded by the enthroned liar
Embraced by his eunuch host
The ice age of religious thought comes to an end
Sing praises to the wasteland
behold a forsaken and inglorious earth
Faith means not wanting to know what is true
ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂFriedrich Nietzsche
Universal laws enjoy your own suffering
Pathetic life live on your knees
Govern all things spread brutality
Weakminded man like an atrophied tree
Nazarene on the cross filth larvae
You will be forever vassal scourge of abject
Like straw on cyclone disoriented beings
Design the future yield all things
Glory to the strong they shall inherit the Earth
Cursed the weak they inherit the yoke
Destroyer of false hope you are the real savior
Blessed iron hand death to the weak
Worshiper of the gods sheared sheep
Each verse is a bonfire every word a flame
Abundance to the strong poor moldyminded man
Victory is the basis of all right
The truth sets to all men's free
Thamuz
Bring star of the morning
Lords of the worms and flies
Proclaimer of death
Emerge from the depths of the west
From the north sea
From the icy mountains
From the deserts of south
Devourer of deads
Reaper of youth
Defiler of corpses
Decimator of life
My body lies
On plain coiled snakes
Your wings surround me
Like branches with thorns
Come and crush the seven gates
The dead will rule the land
Wrap in fire my ulcerous body
Pulverize my bones
Sacrifice the beasts
Consume the forest in flames
Poison all the waters
Infect the air
The eternal flames of might dwells
In the impious flesh
Look at my eyes
I'm your creation stained of blood
I walk on whirlwinds as servant of hell
My body lies
On plain coiled snakes
Your wings surround me
Like branches with thorns
Ereshkigal queen of the dark dressed in silk
Honor me and receive my mortuary offering
Mother of violence and vengeance 
Enveloped in shades
and I could before the temples falling down
It's old monoliths in ruins
Their flags burning in a blackened sky
The gloomy moorland a perfect dead landscape
A deserted earth mired in dark
On the battlefield the corpses rot
They remaining as torn flesh
harvester of the night
there are no secrets left anymore
we reap and sow and follow the road
the dead weight finally brought me down
but I will resurface
in stillness came balance and ears to hear
push me aside
hanging on the edge of what Ive been told
and whos to say that it was your mind to mold
restore control mend your broken bones
there is more to be found
every path has a beginning and end
but I never chose where to begin
if love is what were living in so be it
Im not afraid anymore
weightless love you know me so well
weightless love you know me so well
weightless love you know me so well
weightless love you know me so well
weightless love
stripped down to nothing humble and shameful
I have nothing to lose
bring me back to dust start again
I have nothing to offer
I have nothing to lose
I am dust once again in the endless blue
every path has a beginning and end
every soul has a story to lend
tell me how you perceive this life you live
tell me do you watch it slip away
all the knowledge you've ever retained
burn what you know
burn what you love and start anew
what's left of it all is the truth
burn what you love
whats left of it all
is the only truth
All Ive ever longed for
was it a waste of time or will I get mine
Abandon me and Ill adapt to the loss
What a dark and fragile place this is
I am stuck in between the lines of understanding
What it is to merely exist and to prosper
I cant believe Im alive
amidst the world taking away everything I am
all I am all I am
abandon me and I'll adapt to the loss
quintessential growth in the palm of your hand
winter embrace me and all I am
forgotten souls bask in the bitter cold
I'll be descending in my sinking sleep
Wishful thinkers
We are the ones with a seed of hope
With no space to grow
We are the ones
That hold what little we have so close
My mind longs to be still once more
What a dark and fragile place this is
I am stuck in between the lines of understanding
What it is to merely exist and to prosper
But in my mind I'll be fine
But in my mind Ill be fine
I am forever in debt to the ones who left
I would never ask the world a favor
it would never happen
In a haze every winter's morning
The sunrise in all it's glory
Defeated the night once again
This is a love I cannot comprehend
White wolf you are home
With guidance I am whole
Follow the footprints in the snow
Reoccurring dreams what a calming sight
A luminous stare that brings me peace of mind
Isolated I am the one who walks alone
I am remnants of anything that survived
I am a new being on the inside
Fear is the only thing I've ever left behind
Winter solstice brings the harshest age
And the sun will rarely show it's face
Smoke signals over the trees
A place for one the prodigal son
Wisdom comes in waves and is given to none
Forced to survive
I hope I'm still alone in your eyes
You are home
White wolf you are home
With guidance I am whole
Follow the footprints in the snow
In silence I am noise
With vibrance there's no void
A thousand eyes watching me
They will see me watching back
White wolf of the night
You are my only guiding light
White wolf of the night
You are my only guiding light
Engraved in stone we've been dethroned
As I roam through eternity I let go of control
Another day another night pass me by
My uncertainty always comes to light
I build my walls up to leave out the rest
We are what takes our time so take all of mine
We have become outgrown
The night can't last forever
and we're running out of days
This feeling is here to stay
tear me away
I build my walls up to leave out the rest
In my rise I will not falter
In my rise I will never stop
A question can never be the answer
Celestial floods
with every step
I would lose everything
to see you live on
The night can't last forever
and we're running out of days
This feeling is here to stay
tear me away
I'll burn so bright forget about the night
I'll burn so bright remember me when I am gone
Celestial floods with every step
The luster loses its shine
I'll never lose mine I'll never lose mine
Everything you love you let down
Tell me is it wrong to love at all
Call me the victim call me the failure
The ice gets thinner as I break through layers
Treading through the boundless
I rebuke the blessing that I never received
A thousand times before Ive been here
On the outside looking in
Poisoned thoughts from those somber days
I've become the darker half
This is the part of me
I want to go away
I am abhorred
And allured by this current state of darkness
And in retrospect
I could never be a shepherd without the sheep
In darkness light persists
In weakness we resist
My former self was a cry for help
Closed off to the world and ones I love
A lost cause with an ounce of hope
Clinging to it with everything in me
A chapter lost is a lesson gained
May the fire that resides still remain
Remove the thorns from my side
Luminous sky above hear my cry
All my life the angst and agony
Take me away this is my final plea
I could never be a shepherd without the sheep
In darkness light persists
In weakness we resist
In darkness light persists
In weakness we resist
How long has it been
Since I was reassured
That everything will be alright in the end
Tell me the things I never wanted to hear
Tread on me subconsciously
Give me what I lack
There is no turning back
Holding my tongue was holding me down
I couldnt say anything as you watched me drown
You watched me
You walked on me
You watched me
You walked on me
Ruined me from the inside out
Watch me fall apart
The here and now is such a daunting task
Every part of me has changed
But theres something inside of me
That stayed the same
The nights are cold and the days are bleak
Like the oldest tree I am weak
Ill live on away from it all
Its the only way Ill find
Where I really belong
Tread on me subconsciously
Give me what I lack
There is no turning back
The undeniable remains
The truth will always sting
How can I learn to love at all
When everything is so temporary
How can I learn to love at all
When everything is so temporary
I was just giving in
I was just spending my time
All of my time in my head
While the outside of me was dead
I was just giving in
When we speak we create
When we love we relate
Exist for just a fraction of a second
And you know youre alone
Paint myself in purity
Lose myself in weightless love
Close my eyes as the world goes away
Call it emptiness or call it grace
To never know is not the saving face
When we speak we create
When we love we relate
The audible mind meets the mind awake
We align our thoughts to mold like clay
Quiescent beings of the new age
Find your way find your way
Exist for just a fraction of a second
And know youre alone
Paint myself in purity
Lose myself in weightless love
The aura hides in a sacred place
Quiescent beings of the new age
Find your way find your way with me
In this solitary state every word has weight
We align our thoughts to mold like clay
Find your way find your way
Lost souls collide to find
everything unsound
All that's lost is here on the ground
I can't be found
Wanderer I can't be found
Shrouded in secrecy a face you can't see
I am the enigma of the everchanging
My veins
the trees and the in between
I've come to realize that's it's all in sync
Within the deep of the night
when lost souls collide
there you will find me
wandering endlessly
Night feelings settle in
I'm falling deeper
and I can't pretend
I don't know where I am anymore
and I'm closing every open door
Tear this weary mind to pieces
So drown me out
I'm filled with doubt
Maybe I'll burn
maybe I'll never learn
Disconnect recollect
I'll disconnect
I'm feeling lost and it feels okay
still getting darker everyday
Drown me
drown me out
drown me
Night feelings settle in
I'm falling deeper and I'll break and bend
I am not what I was to begin
there's still so much to find in the end
Maybe there's peace in being lost
maybe there's hurt in being home
maybe there's hurt in being home
I can't be found
Native tongues
We have accepted
That we can never see eye to eye
With one another
Fear remains on your soul and as life unfolds
You have become the tale untold
Bury me under dirt and sorrow
Like a broken dream
This was never meant to be
End the noise end it now
Slow voices surround me
With nowhere to go
I refuse to listen
Empty stares from uneasy eyes
I see you're dead inside
Stuck in gloom so soon
Am I in the wrong
Am I losing ground
The judgement you speak
Has skewed all clarity
Pacing around the room
All the eyes are now on you
Empty stares from uneasy eyes
I see you're dead inside
Stuck in gloom so soon
The outcast in me
Can see right through
The desperation in you
I have just one word of advice
A message to the stray
You've become stagnant
You've become tame
Stop living halfway stop living halfway
As evenfall strikes into the sky
Far away in the dark glimpsing moonlight
Sickening souls cry out in pain
Whispering voices summoning screams
Waiting for Satan to bless their sins
Blackhearted angels fallen from grace
Possessed by the search for utter darkness
Hear the cries from the Mourning Palace
Feel the gloom of restless spirits
Hear the screams from the Mouring Palace
Feel the doom of haunting chants
Eternal is their lives in misery
Eternal is their lives in grief
Abandoned in a void of nothingness
A chain of anger a fetter of despair
In this garden of depraved beings
This unsacred place of helpless ones
Satan blessed the creatures
Inswathed them in endless night
Whispering voices summoning screams
Waiting for Satan to bless their sins
Blackhearted angels fallen from grace
Possessed by the search for utter darkness
You have returned to the torturechambers
To find peace among the rotting corpses
You have returned to the execution place
To inhale the smell of blood
Death and terror rules the land
We have been spellbound
You have returned to the hidden graves
Only you know about
You have returned to to face your victims
And feel sensation of violence once again
Death and terror rules the soul
You have been spellbound
By the Devil
Murderer you have returned
To create fear and sorrow
Death and terror rules the land
We have been spellbound
By the Devil
By the light of the moon
And the beings of the night
A curse has been laid upon us
To seek and tear celestial gloss to pieces
By the power of death
And the shadow of the reaper
A call has been brought upon us
To complete the infinite fall of heaven
Without the wit or will to end this journey
We continue travelling towards our faith
Harvesting helpless Christian spirits
Raping the sanctity of saints
The heavenly father is stretching his hand
Pathetically begging for mercy
We spit and piss on his sacred flesh
As we breathe the breath of the unholy
For with the sign of the pentagram
Hellfire rage is for us to come
As we shall wander the pit
Unhallowed by the infernal one
We are forever captured
By the embrace of death
King of tempests and storms
Lord of innumerable figures and forms
Blessed with thy cold I am
As I upon the shoulders of mine
Bear the burden of Thine
Once I got touched by a fire from beyond
Caressed by the feathers of the fallen
I took the fate in my hand
My raging Commander
My constant Shade
My soul's Persecutor
My eternal Divinity
Revealing Thy powers in visions and dreams
Invoking your magic at night
Honoured I am to mission Thy word
Within a creed is sworn of majestic might
An infernal allegiance in which I pay my share
Beholding Thy commotion
I entreat You with devotion
I subsume Your might with strength
I will carry on with You as my guardian
Against the lambs of the light
Possesses by the true god of earth I am
Possessed for eternity
A scarlet sunset
The threshold to nightplay
A sinful oath is to be sworn
A beckoning bloodlust
Among the seekers
Tyrannic hunger yearns
A gathering in flames and fires
Devil's daughters dance
Scourged in filth obscene and lewd
Longing to dark desires
The nocturnal beast appears
In an evil despotic shape
Expectant watching gracelessly
Before demanding the sluts of lust
Come forth harlots let's begin
Rise and give praise in front of Me
And receive eternal life from Me
Welcome my spirit in honour of Me
So drink of the blood I provide you
And you shall all forever wander in
The shadows of death
Oh yes Master Let us receive
Thine offer and drink with thee
And become a part of Thy realm
With lust sex and sodomy
For we are those who seek life eternally
Blood is life and it shall be all ours
I could drag you to my chambers
And strip you naked in darkness
I could pull your fingernails out one by one
And rape you till you find no hope
I could rip your guts out
And let you watch me
Sacrifice your unborn child
I could leave you to starve
And even bring you to total silence
but I won't
For I find no pleasure in your physical pain
I want your Christian soul to crumble
Your fucking soul
When I have seen your church go up in flames
And you are weeping I will laugh
When I have seen you mourn over loved ones
I will grin in the shadows
For that gives me pleasure
tormenting a Christian soul
Soul on departure six six six
Onward onto another existence
A trip far beyond all pleasant dreams
A voyage through desolation sights
Inner transformation
Subconscious flight
In the glance fields of fires
In the distance meadows of might
Where minds being enshrouded in a complete night
The fading of love life and light
Wandering an endless journey
Dead within a trace
Entering a lost dominion soulless and free
Visiting a foreign place but yet so known
Another dimension opens for me to see
Heaven sure ain't made for me to be
Soul on arrival six six six
One short step from unhallowed ground
The ground of a Kingdom Come
Dead spirits communion
Unorthodox profane void
Gardens temples palaces
I have seen them all
Master of disharmony
Welcome my tainted soul
Take me from the hordes of the living
Into the blessed darkness
Master of disorder
Take my impure flesh
Lead me unto the path of temptation
Save me from cowardness
Master of sin
Take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
For I am the damned
Master of death
Take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain
Master of sin
Take my cursed heart
Bring me where I can find salvation
For I am the damned
Master of death
Take my pitiful life
I am enslaved
I shall never forget the pain
He became the swarm indeed a pitiful imitation
Existence woven into darkness prudence did fall
In Satan's beauty life was found
Illness and plagues torture and blight
Is what she brings
Mocking holy standards deceiving feeble fools
Is what she loves
Granted with powers gifted with magic
Watching the world through raven eyes
Damned woman mischievous whore
Heretic princess
Devil's own
Her seductive elegance
Excites your weak flesh
Her diabolical beauty
Enchants your bewildered mind
You damn woman
You mischievous whore
You heretic princess
You are Devil's own
A serenade made out of black magic
She has learned to set souls afire
And makes sure that you never
Will leave it's trance
Her diabolical beauty
Enchants your bewildered mind
Langtder borte i mÃÂÃÂ¸rket
Gjennom tretopper der mÃÂÃÂ¥nelys driver
Langtder borte i all tÃÂÃÂ¥ke
Inn gjennom min sjel den sorte angst river
PÃÂÃÂ¥ de mosegrodde steiner de seg viser
Ekkoenefra deres grufulle jamring
EndelÃÂÃÂ¸stdu kan hÃÂÃÂ¸re

Raabjorn Reflect Ghost Ship's Mist
Long there away in darkness
Through treetops there moonlight shines
Long there away in all mist
Inside my soul the black anxiety tears
On the mossgrown stones they show themselves
When nightdarkness has fallen
Echoes from their horrorfull moanings
Endless you can hear
In the horizon far away
Is glimpsed the talking mist
Hordes of fire ride in a flock
By daybreak they gather by a hiddenaway headland
The icecold snow
Has come
This time
In everlasting snowfall
Reflects The Mists Of Draugheim
Way over there in the darkness
Through treetops where moonlight glides
Way over there in masses of fog
In through my soul the dark angst rends
On stones covered in moss they show themselves
When the dark of night covers over
The echoes from their horrid screams
Endlessly you may hear
Far away in the horizon
Apears a gliding mist
By dawn they gather by a hidden cape
The chilling snow
Has arived
This time
For three years and counting
Life kicks us when we're down but we
We just keep trying
What else can we do
Dwell on the past and it will bury you
But it's getting harder to look ahead
With all these conflicting thoughts in my head
The days are too dark
And they last too fucking long
That's why we made a promise
That's why we carved it in stone
And where it was written
Is where it will fucking stay
It's the sword that we will live by
Even if it means we have to die this way
Destination death or better days
Destination death or better days
Destination death or better days
When we've had enough we've had enough
We are we are We are Unbreakable
We are we are We are Unbreakable
We are we are We are Unbreakable
We are we are We are Unbreakable
We are we are We are Unbreakable
This is where it ends
I'm putting my foot down
I'm sick of second guessing and I'm
Fucking sick of falling down
Rock bottom is a beautiful start
We're rising up to show the world our scars
From a former life that we'd rather not hide
This is our time
Destination death or better days
Destination death or better days
Destination death or better days
Destination
We came crashing down right on time
Like the twentyninth of twenty nine
Days spent down on our knees
Watching stolen soil sift through our fingers
So what the fuck are we still waiting for
For some someone to save us
For the rains to come
Watching strong foundations come undone
We're not waiting for the dust to settle anymore
We're not waiting for the dust to settle anymore
Kicking down the door
Kicking down the door
All hope died when the hunger came
And soon every dirty face just looked the same
Common graves are calling our names
Calling us out of a life plagued by doubt
We used to be so fucking string
Is there no such thing as a heartfelt word
In times of fair weather
We're not waiting for the dust to settle anymore
We're not waiting for the dust to settle anymore
This is a lesson in letting your guard down
So next time I'll trust my fucking instincts
Next time you come around
All you will get are cold stares cold shoulders
I can only hang on tight for so long
I'm letting you go
I will be just fine on my own
You can't come in
I'm leaving you out in the cold
Because there's no room
Left in my heart for fakes like you
I can only hang on tight for so long
I'm letting you go
I will be just fine on my own
You can't come in
I'm leaving you out in the cold
Because there's no room
Left in my heart for fakes like you
For fakes like you
For fakes like you
For fakes like you
I'm looking for a Miracle Man
That tells me no lies
I'm looking for a Miracle Man
Who's not in disguise
I don't know where he'll come from
And I don't know where he's been
But it's not our Jimmy Sinner
Because he's so obscene
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Today I saw a Miracle Man
On TV cryin'
Such a hypocritical man
Born again dying
He don't know where he's going
But we know just where he's been
'Twas our little Jimmy Sinner
That I saw on the screen
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man
A Devil with a crucifix
Brimstone and fire
He needs another carnal fix
To take him higher and higher
Now Jimmy he got busted
With his pants down
Repent ye wretched sinner
Self righteous clown
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Well I know where you live
I know you live alone
I'll pay a visit in your darkest hour
I've got a treat in store
Won't be the same no more
And I will demonstrate my holy power ha ha
I see through
What it is inside you
I'll make you breakdown breakdown
Breakdown and cry
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
You know what I'm about
I'll cast the demons out
And I'll persist until the battle's won
I'll feel your creeping flesh
If you're to be possessed
Then I will desecrate what you've become
I see through
What it is inside you
I'll make you breakdown breakdown
Breakdown and cry
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
Devil's daughter
You don't want a holy war
Devil's daughter
The time has come at last
Your future days have past
No use in fighting battles you can't win
The final conflict's lost
You can't afford the cost
Don't try to expiate your father's sins
I see through
What it is inside you
I'll make you breakdown breakdown
Breakdown and cry
Breakdown breakdown
Breakdown and cry
CrazyBabies
Crazy babies never say die
Born to live on a permanent high
Flying high above the world below
They'd better come down soon
Or everyone will know
Nobody's gonna change them change them
They've gone over the top
Nobody's gonna tame them tame them
They're never gonna stop
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
CrazyBabies
When they were born they were born to be wild
Some say I'm another devil's child
Crazy babies in a world of their own
I am a crazy babe
You'd better leave me alone tonight
Nobody's gonna change me change me
I'm gonna do it 'till I die
Nobody's gonna tame me tame me
So you better not try
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
CrazyBabies
No use talking 'bout if they'll last
Where they're goin' or about their past
They're just the result of our society
So frustrated just like you and me
Nobody's gonna change them change them
They've gone over the top
Nobody's gonna tame them tame them
They're never gonna stop
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Walk that walk
Talk that talk
Well I know I could be just another stranger
But to you I guess I'm just another fool
Then you hide behind a wall of silly rules
Nobody thinks the way I do
I guess that nobody dares
Your head's so full of things
So set your mind free of them
I'm breaking the rules
I suppose you think I think I know it all
Nobody hears the things I say
I guess that nobody cares
My head's so full of things
I set my mind free of them
I'm breaking the rules
Breaking all the rules
Can't you see they're nothing without you
Empty heads full of fools
Well I know that you would love to go to heaven
But you know that you're just too afraid to die
But to you the truth is just another lie
Nobody hears the things I say
I guess that nobody cares
My head's so full of things
I set my mind free of them
I'm breaking the rules
Breaking all the rules
Can't you see they're nothing without you
Empty heads full of fools
You're comin' home
There's blood on the walls
When Charlie and the family make house calls
If you're alone
Then watch what you do
'Cause Charlie and the family might get you
Can you hear them in the darkness
Helter skelter spiral madness yeah
Bloodbath in paradise
But there's nowhere you can run to baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep in paradise
California sun
But you're still in bed
And the California rain is turning red
No sign of life or the keepers of doom
In Charlie and the keeper's scarlet room
Can you hear them in the darkness
Helter skelter spiral madness yeah
Bloodbath in paradise
But there's nowhere you can run to baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep in paradise
They'll summon you
To wake from the dead
As you lie beeding murdered in your bed
The sweetest dreams
Are all in your mind
But no one wakes when Charlie creeps behind yeah
Execution halts your breath
Helter skelter spiral death
Bloodbath in paradise
But there's no where you can wait now baby
Bloodbath in paradise
Forever sleep in paradise
So it's no wonder that he grew up to be so wild
Fire in the sky
Can't you see that all my castles are burning
Fire in the sky
Won't you help me now my castles are burning
Fire in the sky
Can't you see that all my castles are burning
Fire in the sky
Won't you help me now my castles are burning
Fire in the sky
Can't you see that all my castles are burning
Fire in the sky
Won't you help me now my castles are burning
Fire in the sky

Fire in the sky
Won't you help me now my castles are burning

And when she tells me to come

God damn them
They'll never put me away put me away
My soul's on fire

Let's party
I don't want to be a hero
I don't want to ever let you down
No I don't want to let you down
I could try to take you higher
But I don't want to wear a broken crown
You know it brings me down
Don't think you'll ever understand me
I don't even understand me
Don't have the power to annoint you
And I don't want to disappoint
The fools no more
The fools no more
I couldn't answer all your questions
And if you're lost I couldn't find your way
I couldn't find your way
You know you have to face the music
So don't you run away
Everybody's talking crazy
Some think I am a devil maybe
I don't want to hear about it
Don't want to have to scream and shout
At fools no more
The fools no more
So I don't want to be a hero
Don't want to sit upon your crippled throne
I've got a life of my own
I am not your destination
Or a road that's gonna lead you home
So baby please don't go
Please don't go
Please don't go
You ask me the time of day
I tell you I don't know
In darkness I'm light years away
The voices come and go
Save me
All my life I've been a liar
Save me
All my life I've been a liar
Burning bridges in the rain
The crying embryo
I seem so blissfully insane
But still the pain won't go
Save me
All my life I've been a liar
Save me
All my life I've been a liar
Sacred words
The angels wait for me
They'll set me free
But I can't see the joke's on me
Babies crying
Other people's tears
And in their eyes
They have reflected wasted years
You ask me who I really am
I still say I don't know
The doors have all been tightly slammed
The poison seeds are sewn
Save me
All my life I've been a liar
Save me
All my life I've been a liar
Dying angels
Falling from above
I've had enough
I cannot laugh the joke's on me
Shattered dreams you cannot realize
Won't sympathize it's in your eyes
Why can't you see
Am I the liar Tell me who's the liar
I'm looking for a Miracle Man
That tells me no lies
I'm looking for a Miracle Man
Who's not in disguise
I don't know where he'll come from
And I don't know where he's been
But it's not our Jimmy Sinner
Miracle Man got busted
Miracle Man got busted
Today I saw a Miracle Man
On TV cryin'
Such a hypocritical man
Born again dying
He don't know where he's going
But we know just where he's been

Repent ye wretched sinner

You see the shadows closing in
I know the fall has just begun
Nowhere to hide you can't get out
You were trapped inside your lonely life
Empty inside almost insane
Feel so lonely you're stuck to bare the pain
Only you can take control
Watch out before the hangman takes your soul
Don't hide there nowhere to run
No escaping from all the things you've done
It's time to face reality
There is no chance for you to feel
Falling loosing your ground
And times running out but still you're blind
You're down and out you're lost in paradise
You're just a fool a fraud filled with lies
You're in a land where shadows watching you
That land is only an illusion of life
Watch out darkness will come on your way
Decide if you ever want to change
You're the one with the golden key
To the future and to your destiny
You need to find out who you are
Take my advice or else you wound get far
Stop pretending that you're the man
Guilty of charge it's time to take your stand
Falling loosing your ground
And times running out but still you're blind
You see the shadows closing in
I know the fall has just begun
Nowhere to hide you can't get out
You were trapped inside your lonely life
Be deceived its powers hidden
Darkness lurks invisibility
Fear the deed of Carwan's hands
A mythic treachery
Fireborn to rule them all
An orb of might hunger insatiable
Evil craft
A deadly tool to seal the blasphemy
You will see
And then the lands will fall as one
And if the light subdues defenders hope is gone
Ancor veiled in vengeance calls its name
Powers far beyond the dreamers of the wild
Dark echoes shatter through a world unknowing
Shadow dying to behold the orb of warn
Minions march to mountain city
See the beasts creations of wizardry
Wails of war
Tonight the dead will die and rise again
Mirrors crack the light is fading
Hate reviled illusions and imagery
Feel the scent of fear and madness
darkness settles in
walls will bleed
And then all the lands are free
And the Carwan's fate is sealed
The singing king is crowned
And the world can live again
The mirrors are restored and Calannor fares on
By destiny he's bound to live on eternally
And then the orb will be destroyed
Will be taken by the flames and lost in history
So the world can carry on
And Calannor fares on and still lives on
And mankind will forget
Ancor veiled in vengeance calls its name
Powers far beyond the dreamers of the wild
Ancor veiled in vengeance calls its name
Powers far beyond the dreamers of the wild
Dark echoes shatter through a world unknown
Shadow dying to behold the orb of warn
Was whipped on the cross left there bleeding
The black man hanged and scientist gassed
In a world of endless suffering
The Indians slaughtered and the rebels
Punished for the riot at the red square
You think the world is round
Is there still a way to live
In this world of madness
Will we ever learn to give
Blinded by our arrogance
We fail to see the state of art
Existence of those who fathom life
Wisdom lies deep in our hearts
Today's state of science
Can not fathom the depths of existence
Human mind is inadequate
To provide an explanation
The leaders pray to god for help
But those who god will be the master
Our blood's still red and we share
The same dream will we ever learn
Master of our universe holy father can you tell
If there's a god for each one of us
We pray to break this magic spell
Don't need your understanding
Live the mess I'm in
I'm in a chain reaction
Let me in
I saw the big lights flashing
Ruin the entire land
I still hear children screaming
Goin' insane
Fighting all the demons
In the middle of the night
I open my eyes and I just see I'm still alive
Here's another story of the world I'm living in
You can see a hero fall tonight
I see dark angels fly
Nothing else remains a mystery
Smiling on the outside
Empty on the inside
Lost even my direction
Where to go
I'm still in this madhouse
My life's just one big lie
No more air to breath
We're face to face
Covered by a smiling mask
To hide all our sins
But really have to see
That there's no more truth within
We have to go on have to find a way
It's not the first time you should know
We've been through hard times and worries before
But in the end we always find a way to go
I don't follow I don't understand
You use to be so strong and sure but suddenly
Heaven comes falling down on you
Dark clouds surrounding us
The light seems so far away
But still I believe it's not too late
So don't lose the spirit
Without it we're standing small
So keep up the spirit
This is our time in life to take all the chances
before we throw it all away
I know your worries I know your agony
I'm also hurt from time to time
I guess we need to believe once again
That we can beat the odds like many times before
I don't follow I don't understand
To throw away what we've achieved is not the way
Use your imagination now
Could you really leave it all
We all slip and fall sometimes
But the inspiration will be there again
You know we didn't chose an easy way
But somehow we've managed
To overcome impossibilities
We have only got this far
By being who we are
We all slip and fall sometimes
But the inspiration will be there again
So don't lose the spirit
Without it we're standing small
So keep up the spirit
This is our time in life
Without it we're standing small
So keep up the spirit
This is our time in life to take all the chances
before we throw it all away
Everything you've done to break me
Is written on the wall
I don't know where to go
I've been on the run from something
Every night I fear that you will
Kill my heart and soul
Like a ghost inside of me
You whisper I'm your saviour
You're the queen of madness
Wears no crown
Lost in deepest sadness
Falling down
You deceived me
Blood stained and never free
You've blamed all your shame on me
I have made a promise
To get back on you someday
Justice come it will be done
You will face the darkest future
You will go to hell
Time will tell I wish you well
The chill I feel at night will disappear
When you are gone
All the terror in my world will end
When I'm the saviour
Like a song from a distant earth
Like a dream that is far too real
You took life as if was away from us
We were blind to the truth behind
We were tricked by your vicious mind
We had hopes of a different kind
We believed that the traveller had come
So long souls lost worlds lingered on
Our hopes were gone but we remained
As starts in a darkest place
A space of love so drained
And then through eternities
You came to set us free
We lost the game in our minds grew madness
Your treachery like a blade to the bone
You took our souls
But our dreams you left untouched
Silently we weep
It is dawn it is time to go
time to save what is yet to save
We will leave for another world reload
Gather around all our ships are packed
Say goodbye to your lives of old
In darkness dreams begin to stir
Trough generations they live on on and on
We will regain our land we will be back
You will regret you'll live to see
The day we come The day of our return
As stars in a darkened place
A space of love so drained
And then through eternities
You came to set us free
Silently we weep
It's time to fight
As one on the battlefield for every right
It's up to you to change someone's destiny
It's time to prove what you wanna do
I can see a burning flame
That light up lost gone souls
Somewhere is a spark of life
That leads towards our goal
We're marching for freedom
Stand for one kingdom
Follow the wisdom all true at heart
Gather all forces from long distant courses
Stronger then ever all true at heart
I have a dream
To see all the people of our world be free
We'll live as one our enemies forces
Will be on the run the future is here
I run trough the mist of the void
I am hunted by fear my soul is repressed
And my heart is a statue of stone
Eos is dead and gone there's shadow ahead
The tides will turn for me it's my destiny
By the river of Styx through the echoes of death
I am guided by harmonies remnants of song
Beats of a lonely heart is leading the way
Silence is broken in the halls of the dead
Until she's found I won't give up I'll carry on
Chaos calling me
Until she's found I won't give up
I'll carry on
Tears falling like comets collide
Stars like dreams in the night
Oh my mind is ablaze with the colours of love
Fireworks fantastic
Fear feeling sincere silently seeping in
How how can I live can I go on
Dreamchaser stargazer
Seed of the world
Search in your soul for the light
Can you hear the song
Songwriter sunsighter
Love is the sign
Follow your heart to the end
Become divine
Sing whispering galaxies sing
Sail on the winds of the sun
Let my soul come aware of the powers within
Let the new day dawn then
Lingering life I am reborn revived
Song I'm part of the song A piece of our soul
Steve came out of school with lousy grades
The year was 1989
So many wasted years without a trace
Of human touch to warm his spine
With blood in sight and murder on his mind
A desperate soul so near insanity
And there's a voice inside his head
And it's crying
Screaming out who destroyed his childhood
To take them down
Cause this time you really had it
You will
Till the end
End of time
Play the game
To restrain
Let them hear the drums
It's the sound of revenge
Cause you will always fight
Till the end
End of time
going straight for their
Hearts made of steel
This time it's for real
Way too far away to save them now
Drifting around in a pool of hate
The demons from the past is crawling down
You're tearing out
Their blackened hearts of stone
For real
This time it's for real
I Should Not Trust You
You Should Me Why
It Seems To Amuse You
By That Smile On Your Face
I Know By Now That You Aint The One
The One To Trust And Who Never Betrays
My Pain Is Your Pleasure
Raised Through Hate To Another
In Search For Human Sense
I See Them All
Betrayed By Other
They Do The Same
Like A Disease
To Which Theres No Cure Now
No One To Trust
Theres Only Yourself
I Asked You Why
You Couldnt Tell
Theres A Reason In Your Past
That Can Tell
You Betrayed Me
I Turned Away Now You See Youre Betrayed
By Yourself
Im Angry
Im Drinking
It Doesnt Matter
What No Other Say
When Life Seems Way To Tough
I Cork Up The Bottle
And Just Cant Get Enough
I Dont Misuse Alcohol
I Abuse Alcohol
When The Pain Doesnt End
It Seems Like My Only Friend
Im Angry
Im Drinking
When It Feels Like Im Locked In A Cage
Doesnt Help  But For The Moment It Seems
That Alcohol Is The Way To Unlock Me
From My Rage
It Doesnt Solve Anything
But It Helps Me To Think
Maybe I Dont Want To Think
Anyway Give Me A Drink
Yeah Ive Got To Blow My Mind
Give Me A Drink Of Any Kind
Yeah Ive Got To Blow My Mind
Too Many Sorrows Just Cant Leave Behind
Im Angry
Im Drinking
Sometimes Life Gets So Fucking Hard
Doesnt Matter What No Others Say
I Relieve The Pain In A Very Wet Way
Yeah Ive Got To Blow My Mind
Give Me A Drink Of Any Kind

Too Many Sorrows Just Cant Leave Behind
Yeah Ive Got To Blow My Mind
So Fucking Angry And It Just Wont Go Away
Yeah Ive Got To Blow My Mind
Ill Take Care Of Reality Another Day
As I Die Cant You See Im Laughing In Your Face
As I Die Cant You See That Im The One Who Won
Now Im Free So Far Away From You
Now Hear My Laugh Cut Through The Air
Now Feel The Pain That I Used To Feel
Love Will Kill Everybody Knows Im Right
To Forget Is To Survive Another Day
Until You See That It Always The Same
Sometimes It Feels That Im Learning To Lose
To Be A Broken Man Forever
And To Be Sure That You Soon Will Feel The Same
They Say The Beast Is Down Below
I Think Hes Near Hes Right Up Here
Down Below Or
Right Up Here
You Draw The Straw
Than Walk The Path
See The Madness
Open Your Eyes
Amputation Of Our Beliefs
I Was Raised To Believe In The Better
Now I See All This Dreams Cant  Be Real
I Cant Deny Some Certain Things
Do Clear The Weather But Just For A While
The Foolish Dream Lives On And On
Until We See The Beast Within
Feel The Pain
As Your Time Passes By
Your Life
Seems Soon To End
As You Spill Your Life Away
Break The Chains
Free Yourself
Break Away
From The Narrow Minded Way
No Regrets
Your Choice Has Been Made
As You Turned Away
Away From Yourself
You NarrowMinded Breed
You Cannot Win
I Saw A Rainbow In The Dark
That Almost Made Me Blind
Lovely Colours From Above
All Messing With My Mind
A Taste So Sweet
I Felt So Good
All I Could Do Was Sigh
Frigid Fucking Bitch From Hell
Who Wanted Me to Die
Take A Piece Of Me
I Promise Not To Leave You Alone
Take A Piece Of Me
Tomorrow I Might Be Gone
I Felt So Sad
She Drove Me Mad
But I Wanted To Go Back
I Never Met A Girl Like Her
Now The Rainbow Was All Black
Bitterness Has Filled My Soul
All She Could Do Was Lie
Horny Fucking Bitch From Hell
Who Wanted Me To Die
Take A Piece Of Me
I Promise Not To Leave You Alone
Take A Piece Of Me
Tomorrow I Might Be Gone
These Things Can Really Hurt
When Youre In The Middle Of It All
Soon Or Late You Realize
Its No Else's Goddamn Fault
For Being So Damn Naive
But Get Stronger When You See
That Love And Hate Go Hand in Hand
And With Time You Learn Your Lesson
That With Hate Follows Goodbye
And You Realize You Shouldnt
Trust Or Believe
Few Are Worth To Trust Or Believe
I Woke Up An Early Morning
My Head Was Full Of Why
I Knew That This Is It
It Was A Nice Day To Die
I Looked Out Through My Window
Pain Was All I Could See
I Knew Nothing Could Stop Me Now
For Me Tomorrow Would Never Be
As I Stood In Front Of The Mirror
My Decision Was Made
I Realized This World Wasnt Meant For Me
I Knew The Time Was Coming Closer
So I Loaded My Gun
I Shot Myself In The Head
Now Im Dead
Im Glad Its Done
I Never Thought I Would Ever
Gonna End Up This Way
I Never Thought Id Forbid
Myself Another Day
I Never Thought Id Would Ever
Make Myself Die
Now Anyway It Is
Forever Goodbye
The Day I Didnt See Your Eyes
Like A Stranger
I Wasnt There
Felt Like The Unwanted Child
Surrounded By Hate
You Used To Be Here
But Now Youre There
No Good Or Bad
Justifies Your Departure
All Thats Left Is Regret
For The Unspoken Words
Your Words I Tried To Grasp
But They Meant Nothing
You Pushed Away
I Wanted To Touch You
But Didnt Dare
Now I Have Lost You
Can Only Touch You In My Dreams
Lost To Eternity
Got No One At All To Blame
Lost To Eternity
As I Fall Into Deadness
I Cant Stand It
You Know Hate It
When They Point Their Fingers At Me
Ill Be Here When You Die
Its Seems So Hopeless
But It Needs To Be Said
Im My Own God
Until The Day Im Dead
But They Dont Seem To Understand
Cant Get It Into Their Heads
Ill Be Here When You Die
Theyre So Blind
Yet I Hope They See
I Do It This Way
To Keep On Being Me
Upstream Is The Way I Go
The Only Way To Be Free
Ill Be Here When You Die
Afraid Of What Will Come
We Always Choose The Easy Way
Trying Not To Offer Others
We Just Fit In And Do As They Say
Were So Afraid To Differ From The Masses
We Try To Belong
One Day Well Realize That We Are Copies
But Then Youth Will Be Gone
Your Way Is The Way
Do As You Please
Razorblades Might Cut Deep
If You Let Regret Into Your Mind
Now IS When We Choose To Live
The Future Is Only A Fantasy
Today Is Real
Who Knows About Tomorrow
As Far As I Know It Might Never Be
So Do As You Feel Now
No Matter What All Other Say
One Day It Will Be Too Late
And Razorblades Will Seem The Only Way
Your Way Is The Way
Do As You Please
Razorblades Might Cut Deep
If You Let Regret Into Your Mind
Share The Black Of A Fallen Dream
Share The Calm Of A Quiet Stream
My Spirit Is Free
No More Fight For A Wish To Be
My Spirit Is Free
As I Rest Myself From Greed
For The Hope Of A Better Life
We Keep Pushing Our Limits To High
But It Seems So Wasted And Dumb
Cause We Know Forever Is A Lie
For The Fame And So Called Glory
We Struggle On But We Know Its Not Gonna Last
So I Raise The Glass To My Lips
Cause I Know Its  Time To Rest
No Further Competition
Just Me Wasting Myself
So Let It Be And Break The Surface
Dont Let Them Tell How Live And How To Be
Ive Had Enough Set Me Free
Leave Me Be
All My Dreams To Fulfill Myself
I Now Do Ignorefortune 
I've figured out 
the perfect plan to build 
in their hours of laughing 
minutes shall rewrite the course 
of their lives 
forever 
shade shade 
for years for years 
we'd watch you grow 
and be ok 
we'd wait 
for years for years 
to watch you grow 
and see you fade we'll see you fade 
but now you see what i mean 
but now you see what i mean 
cause when i told you 
that this was the end 
you didn't believe me 
you didn't believe me 
that i could strike city lights 
and scaling homes 
and tear your civilization down 
to the ground 
precious moments turn to dust 
a failing bloodline approaches 
countdown 
time was time is 
time is over 
they charm their way with promise 
with words appealing to 
your honesty 
your beliefs 
shade shade 
for years for years 
we'd watch you grow 
and be ok 
we'd wait 
for years for years 
to watch you grow 
and see you fade we'll see you fade 
only the greater world 
will see its own 
passengers of akin mind 
only the greater world 
will see its own 
waves aglow surround 
the sound it ignites love and fire 
running for the gate 
never gonna make it out alive 
and I see your eyes 
and feel their life 
the sound it ignites love and fire 
holding on to faith 
that we're gonna make it out alive 
and see the skies 
the grand outline comes down 
I didn't give permission 
please let us go 
I didn't give permission now 
please let us live 
your bloodline is 
no longer 
no escape 
bound to drift eternally 
true to space 
forever moving towards the barren waste 
drawn unto the vacant edge 
finally 
all of my thoughts 
are made to manifest 
bound to drift eternally 
true to space 
forever moving towards the barren waste 
drawn unto the vacant edge

in my escape
I am 
masses content with placement 
subjection's shadow 
living out some bizarre existence 
foreign to me 
rage breaks self control 
violent by nature 
amended for social thralldom 
through imagery 
I now foresee this world 
lost and fading out 
conditioned by the fear 
turning on ourselves 
dreaming I'll be 
awake and free 
question yourself 
mimic the words of god 
they would rather leave me 
severed or tame 
wake up tonight 
let the dead reclaim 
all that's been taken 
they would rather leave me 
in divide 
so follow and wake up 
tonight it's time to walk again 
resonance resonance built 
blood innocence spilled 
war what if it came to pass 
socially conditioned 
violently alone 
slowly we breathe 
once more to be 
slowly we see 
slowly we can breathe 
not with our eyes 
not with the lungs sold 
ash of the bone 
ash of the torn earth 
once more to live 
once more we shall be 
they would rather leave me 
severed or tame 
wake up tonight 
let the dead reclaim 
all that's been taken 
they would rather leave me 
in divide 
so follow and wake up 
tonight it's time to walk again

for just a moment to unfold

this is why i came here 
to return what was given to me 
now we'll see 
who is here to stay 
sweet the taste of vengeance 
followed by your downfall 
rip this world apart

and learn to let someone else be free 
there is no escape from the past this time 
fuck the bed that you're making 
wake up in a burning grave 
never mind all the times that we would fly 
cut the chord bend the fabric's essence 
and moderate the lies 
oh god 
oh my god 
they're coming out 
bound for generations 
the shadows of a fallen kind 
back out back out again 
the bleeding souls 
infected 
draining the life of everything 
we the ones who redefine the light 
still we walk alone 
because of all the things in life 
the curse is in the knowledge 
we the ones who redefine the light 
still we walk alone 
before waking up 
close your eyes 
we are the prototypes of the universe 
We are alone 
only believe the silence in your heart 
cross the tragedy 
failing to put in genuine effort 
for the time the end is official 
perilous the cost is way too high 
and far beyond the pay 
steel frame distant sight 
and so unbreakable 
the pattern by which you will now decide 
and learn to let someone else be free 
blood faith christ lies blood 
there is no god
My eyes open 
but i can't feel anything 
broken and confused 
tell me how do i escape this dream 
didn't ask to be here 
but i feel like it's too late to leave 
trapped inside this world 
or trapped inside of me 
so cold and alone it's clear to me 
struggle is futile and my future's bleak 
in a place where time collides 
forsaking the world 
crossing the divide 
of belief 
memories 
deceiving 
in this place 
i feel real 
dreams are made 
to find the shore 
someway I've recognized 
my image has gone awry 
don't wake up 
dreams are made 
to find the shore 
someway implied 
it's going to be alright 
I will fall to meaning I will fall beneath 
from it all the magic fades 
withering beneath the world 
way beyond the reach of the water 
forgive me all I'm leaving 
like all things sound 
they later move on 
likewise 
my life has gone 
patient waiting for change 
to reach me 
trade 
taken from the dream 
endlessly 
just let me be 
let me sleep 
wait and see 
this consciousness 
will soon break 
don't wake up 
dreams are made 
to find the shore 
someway implied 
it's going to be alright 
I will fall to meaning I will fall beneath 
from it all the magic fades 
withering beneath the world 
way beyond the reach of the water 
forgive me all I'm leaving 
won't somebody come pinch me 
wake me up from this bad bad dream 
I'm getting lost in this world between 
stuck in purgatory 
oh this must be heaven 
how spining round 
don't know which way is up or down 
and i'm trying to reach for some air 
don't know how i'm going to breathe 
and i'm trying to reach for some air 
don't know how i'm going to breathe 
reach for some air 
I can't breathe
I never meant to make 
you feel a life of bother 
so many miles apart 
and out of sight 
show me a way beyond this lonely ocean 
we'll make the sky ignite 
then just sail away 
gonna go away 
you were never meant to see 
the soloist in me 
always and forever 
i will give you 
all my love and my heart 
for the day all the way 
we can't remember 
just what it is to vibe and be ourselves 
we can't remember 
the feeling of being right here 
we are the world 
united 
we are the world 
wake up my sleeping child 
follow in majesty 
you'll never get to see 
the soloist imagined in your dreaming 
always and forever 
i will give you 
all my love and my heart 
for the day all the way 
no delay 
every night 
seems bright 
sings goodbye 
we can take off 
and fly 
always and forever 
i will give you 
all my love and my heart 
for the day all the way 
gonna give you all my love world 
gonna give it to you now 
all for the day 
gonna give it to you all the way 
always and forever 
all for the day 
gonna give it to you all the way you know 
see where your heart has gone gone for now 
you're never meant to see 
you'll never ever be what you love 
give into me now 
gonna make my heart sing 
you'll never get to see 
you'll never ever be what you love 
for the world 
you'll never get to see where you are now
this nebulous acquiescence 
transposes my song 
subtle modes of separation 
becoming multiplying 
ascending upward 
stemming from roots within 
recapture me 
long before surrender 
deny I will give 
optimism paves our disconnect 
shattered this wave of expectance 
divided eyes 
subtle thoughts of separation 
elevating magnifying 
ever 
stemming from roots within 
recapture me 
long before surrender 
deny I will give 
optimism paves the the disconnect 
so just stay with me 
we lose control 
stay with me 
we've lost control 
through vacant promise 
and in the wake of my transmission 
the only thought that comes to mind 
are we alone 
heads out the gate 
all my life I've been waiting to feel this love 
wait for the call 
I'm waiting 
I'm holding on 
to notions of a former belief 
I redeemed 
fade out behind 
the quiet release of the reins 
sadly I just let it die 
no my time has not decayed 
sustaining reasons for my salvation 
forgiveness is not impossible 
dispose of this sense 
another innocent motion 
suffers the consequences 
lost in pain 
resound 
descending 
senseless 
come detached 
into the modern 
cycle of existence forever 
powerless 
come detached 
into the modern 
interval of existence forever 
ailing me 
nothing can be replaced 
separate 
repugnance and disdain 
rooted deep within 
I try to gain control 
I'm lost within this mental labyrinth 
with all the things we know 
I ask myself this question 
are we alone 
in this whole wide universe 
are we alone 
I don't know 
are we alone 
heads out the gate 
all my life I've been waiting to feel this love
roads aligning 
distant memories come forth 
bound by perception 
senses and obscure direction 
the mind assured 
by evidence 
designed result 
no matter either way 
experience moves forth 
chains withholding me jade 
we know by now 
our discerning is relative 
to all that we see 
through an idea 
we're assured however 
to survive 
we'll survive 
by the clock 
I'll find a way out 
change or grown 
despite my doubt 
of whether I'm alone 
or not 
the world knows 
its source is growing old 
and thin 
bitter over the fact 
that I'm still here 
I'm over being alive 
over being alive 
Sensational wasted fall from grace
It's all about what you learn to hate
Insatiable hunger from within
Accept that poison skin from the outside in
The unintended consequences die
I never knew blood could run so cold
Accept that poison skin from the outside in
The emptyhanded meet with something worse 
A hand of narrow bone leads me on
Inside the needle veins the blood is drained
I lie unrestrained and breaking down alone
However long I've slept
I'm Waking up I'm better dead
Arm yourself defend noone else
Far inside you're mine
Live again for if not now when
This is not the end
Your life is compromised most of it was
All your endeavour lies lost
And morning ÃÂ¯ÃÂ¬ÃÂnds my night's work
Lights the remnants on display
I do not seek forgiveness nothing to absolve
For now the need is met I almost hate myself
Almost but not quite
I've taken all control for I am someone now
I do not walk alone as I build the road of bones
Their dumb shock of reaction's what it's for
Full of nothing and I won't be ignored
They got sirens and all that nervous force
They concede a good death's it's own reward
Don't tell me anymore it's what this life is for
I occupy these rooms I build
And word by word the silence is filled
Cutthroat counsel that won't free me
Language I could only dream of until now
I'm ready to begin the silence is wearing thin
Without walls  constant breakdown
Without time  any day now
Without words  fake it somehow without you
Making nothing out of something
They will break what can't be broken
Now I'm made of other skin defiance is wading in
Unforsaken heart take another shot now
Break it to me protect me from the truth
Keep that highborn hope safe and futureproof now
Walls without our self control
Sleep that brings no guarantees
Night awake come take your toll
Right there's the life and death of me
High like a permanent sun
Fly hard through a sky made of thunder
Carelessly counted on what possessed you
Send out the sound of bells let it splinter
When sense of purpose fails it all disintegrates
Crowds unascended now
Rain with the burning showers
Signs come to send me down
These moments made me then
And by them now I am defined again
You always knew
Don't tell me anymore it's what this life is for
How do I contain all the hours of change
How do I believe in all Ive failed to give you
Now now you say those vows couldnt heal you
Ever since you burnt inside me
How do I convince you
Now now you swear that time was only sleeping
Found a heart a home when the mind was blown
Hiding in an unsafe haven
What if Id never known you
Now you shield the need that compels you
Words spawned from fire scrape across the sky
Where once they failed now they strike
One sentence is gone intentions were wrong
Unravelled the strands the damage done
Knives so set and readymade cut the wedding cake
Bride and groom take the empty floor
Caught on film they fill their page
And build their own gilded cage
Hounds castoff clowns with anxious hands
Compare them there the perfect pair
And the parasites descend as one
Man and boy alike a thousand strong
Stand down your defences
In shadows drawn from your future tense
There attends the spectre on the causeway
For this time I'm not forsaken yet
Live on through me
Forget you ever knew me at all
When I'm reckless and I don't belong
Say again the words that I'm founded on
Shout them out and high
Taking again the empty place right beside me
From where you are bring you back home
Will you stay until the end
Before my heart
sets
you
free
And I can't go outside any time of day
Soon as I'm revived thoughts take flight
Lives spun around cradled down in distortion
Hopeless useless worthless
Hateful vengeful numbskull
Deciphered the warnings
Stopped and found it's a long way down
Toll taking core shaking
Not a day goes by I'm unanaesthetised
Words I can't command let alone understand
And I don't condone this any answer I'll deny
Time when we're allowed to say goodbye
Is this the way that we begin
Made our connections when the stars rolled in
Do you recall those constellations
Or did your lose them when tomorrow came
Gone past remembering your all time low
Can't you keep it all
I see surrender in your eyes
We miss the deadline and I don't know why
How many others did you bring down
All unfamiliar till you showed them how
Can't think of everything every time
Trouble will find me now if I don't make a move
I thought that there was nothing left to prove
We said it all don't say it anymore
Nothing anymore
Since time's not on your side or mine
If I meet you halfway do we land so blind
Can't change the contours from within me
Got disconnected from the shape I'm in
Gone past remembering it's over now
More alive than some strung out on the line
I'm held spellbound till now I'm carried away
Where in the world would they begin their march
You better than anyone would know
Man of the moment played a lonely hand
When memory failed vile bodies were all we had
Some covered their own laid under a layer of ash
When memory failed
Man of the moment your time has gone
More unknown than unknown and holding on
Love song vagabonds bags of bones
Skins tones in monochrome carbon codes
All best intentions intensified
More known than unknown and open wide
Love song got it wrong every night
Outside dead inside out of sight
The undecided voices circle down
The conversations all but done
Stake your claim drown in flame
Still appointing blame
The only answer I could hear escaped me
Among the lives I couldn't trust anyone
Even so it's hard to know what was here before
Futures are calling all around
Over the boundaries past defences
When it consumes me love is lost
Love is lost again
Believe enough and I'll be found alive
The undecided voices sail over sundown
The accidental life the evidence evolves
Enough to cancel out real confidence
Where is my dream time now
Get yourself unwrecked a chance to resurrect
Where is my dream time now
Poison ivy Penny Black Jack O'Lantern's back
Springheeled spinning wheel made the wrong deal
Couldn't make it worse
Take it back take it back take it back
Where is my dream time now
Situation's now understood
Indications all not so good
Problems contain contradictions
Pulled right out of context
Some pale emotional pretext
Never let it in it's airtight
Tell yourself again it's all right
Last one to leave is the firstborn
Hardcore identity gets careworn
There's no strategy
No means to take the weight off me
Constrained by anxiety consoled by belief
Saved your sorry skin
I hauled you from the broken wreckage
All gone from this point on
Liberty safe and peace are only old lies
We fight for the glory  we fight for the king
We fight for our lives and loudly we'll sing
Purity of true spirit we just want to preserve
A long time ago we built those sublime walls
And we won't accept they destroy our omnipotence
We fight for the glory  we fight for the king
We fight for religion that is by our side
And now holy virtue we'll help us to survive
Violence and madness are just bad memories
A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
We can defeat our enemies we can win this war
Why are Thomas and Henry abandoning me
Death pain and rout is all I can see
Why are Thomas and Henry abandoning me
The ghost of Anne is all I can see
A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
We can defeat our enemies we can win this war
A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse
The battle of Bosworth was the end of your power
Here I am Richard III
Are you sure of his mistake  Yes my lord
I can't believe this  Damned faith
No doubt  Cassius the liar
We fought  Like brother together
No way out  I'll hate you forever
No thoughts  My rage is your fear
Desdemona couldn't lie  Where is the hanky
I won't forgive 'em  Skies turns grey
No doubt  They are all sinners
I sought  Cassius the betrayer
I thought  I'd love her forever
No way out  Punishment's near
Cassius prepare to die  He's completely mad
Desdemona is a pure sacrifice
The betrayers mustn't survive
No doubt  Forever and ever
Truth came out  Iago the murderer
Throughout  I'm damned whenever
No way out  In heaven I'll feel better
I can see  sky is darkening
There is fear  clouds are burning
I can't feel  sun is setting
There is nothing real in this world
From your souls  is god laughing
Build a wall  is god hiding
To face soon  what are we waiting for
Fight fight fight  fight until you die
Fight fight fight  Honour makes me fly
In the night alone we cry
Standing strong
In the doubts we will die
Everything's wrong
None is safe hope is lost
Democracy is a ghost
Fight fight fight  Fight until you die
Fight fight fight  Honour makes me fly
Scream it louder
Fight Fight
Feel the power
Out in the darkness we search through the night
Will sadness bring us all some sort of new light
We spend our time waiting for a new dawn
Is our destiny to become useless bones
Cause now we can't disguise
What's beyond the lies
And we must fall
Cause now we must conceal
A truth so real
This is our last call
Now with my eyes I can see my decline
Oh God can you please just give me a sign
Are suffering and pain the only reasons to live
Cause now my soul will fly
And I just try
To make me stronger
Cause now we must deal
With truths so real
This is our last call
Now it is time
To change your mind breaking the madness
On Mississippi was born a great art
Where there's strength of a black heart
Blues you can call it you'll sing it everyday
This music is all if you rock this way
The crowds is dancing chords are like a poison
Feel the essence of blues
All that we want
Is to play this song seizing it upon your head
All that we want
Don't stop dancing don't stop singing
One day you'll understand
Now you're prepared to reach in every way
The power of blues
There was a time when Ray ruled the scene
He made revolutions
And there was a time when Chuck created themes
Taking new directions
We seek  Music power
We obtain  Music power
Your heartbeat reaches the moon
I hear them all again
Am I right is this the end
Pictures of chaos and hate
Gloomy thoughts in my mind
I've chosen my way of life
You are no longer mine
Imagine being crushed by one
Imagine your life being done
Dying feelings
Bittersweet
Bloodwork
Burning sadness
Deadly sins
Bloodwork
This feelings that seems to be broken
The blood flows inceting my veins
Run deep into the soul of my body
An experience to strong for this pain
Waiting for chaos just sliding inside
Arrived at the point where's no way back out
Awfully screamings piercing the air
This is the code for the final time
You bend me and you shake me
This feelings that just crushed me
The name of this confusion
Bloodwork disconnection
You let me live my anguish
The word I hear impossible to find
The forces got to wake up
Infects them all again
You made me feel like a winner
One way ride to my inner peace
The sickness between the rooms
Dancing in the sorrow
I'll break you down a thousand smiles
Die with their raging hate
Close your eyes and wait to die
Take your fucking life away
Searching crying breathing the death
As the life starts fading away
Pictures of the dead appears
Deep within my mind
Praying helpless screaming of pain
As I ride to hopeless lies
With blood in your hands  I cry
I don't know what you are looking for
I don't know why you cry for more
Your heart has ever ceased to be
I don't know what you are looking for
I don't know why you cry for more
You close your eyes and start to die
The fury of your hate I feel
Your hands are soiled covered in blood
Take my life and take my soul
I dwell in emptiness
Release my blood and fade away
Take control of my mind
I'm not afraid to die
As my life was built on a thousand lies
Loose your life by manipulation
Slept away by another frustration
The simply truth I fear is here
Dying in its sleep
They called my name I bled for life
Hear them cry again
The blood has left me cold inside
Time will tell the truth of life
It's time to die another way
The way of suicide
Slowly floating poison
The perfect day for my final time
I kill for hate of your preacher and leaders
The hopes and prays of all blindly believers
Nothing betray a weakness
Lost in the scars of sorrow
Die with their lies of justice and squerness
Betrayed by the tyrants destroyed by your master
They will take your soul apart
And let you burn in hell
Hate  is what I feel
Fear  deep in me
Death  so cold and quiet
Love  will never die
Hate  is what I feel
Fear  deep in me
Death  so cold and quiet
Enter  suicide code
As they all close their eyes
The dark turned off the light
They turned me into dead
I learned to hate the people
I never thought I would be there again
A life joke just senseless
I feel my life goes away
I fear as I saw this end
Haunted by the power
The obsession in my mind
Voices from the darkside
Call the dead to reach the grave
Crying for existence
Visions of a dying world
Is it true or still a dream
The daylight race to leave behind
I can see what you see
I can feel what you feel
The day I die
I can hear what you hear
I can dream what you dream
The day I die
The day I die
Absence of redemption
Breathing out the frames of dust
Be a part of this essential war
The darkness of thy soul
Feel the deadly poison
No more opposition
Blackness in my mind sublime
Prepare  the day I die
The day I die
You can't kill my body
A part of your existence
Dwells within our heart
Feelings of our free divine
Step inside this circle
Your love will turn into hate
Join my evil forces
Feel the new connection
I can see it in your dreams
As my blood runs cold
Fear starts to rise
Inside a fire unfold
Flames are burning in my eyes
The sky is turning black
Ash will cover the earth
I'm suffering with every breath
Facing the downfall of man
This is a call for salvation
The pressure is rising and covers my soul
This is my determination
Arming myself for this this eternal war
Inside this cage I will suffer
Freedom is fading like lights of this town
Apocalypse is beginning
Purgatorial ocean the place I will drown
Inside this incarceration
The chains of oppression are shedding my skin
Torture and humiliation
Extinguish my life force kill me from within
Is this reality or fiction
Decapitated by the blades of doom
I'm scarred of facing extinction
The place that we held dear is just a cold tomb
Welcome the new formation an aeon of salvation
Collide with everything you're supposed to be
What is left inside a senseless dream behind
You are still damned for everything you are
For everything you want to be
Hatred by your body
Begging for forgiveness
Betting for survival
Betrayed by his hand
Playing games of life
No more insert coin
The end of life is near
You just reached
reached the line of death
Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the gods
Wheres the streetwise Hercules
To fight the rising odds
Isnt there a white knight upon a fiery steed
I need a hero
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
Hes gotta be sure
And its gotta be soon
And hes gotta be larger than life
Larger than life
Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach
Theres someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
I need a hero
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
Hes gotta be sure
And its gotta be soon
And hes gotta be larger than life
I need a hero
Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning strikes the sea
I could swear there is someone somewhere
Watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach
Like a fire in my blood
I need a hero
Hes gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
He's gotta be sure
And it's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
He's gotta be sure
And he's gotta be soon
And he's gotta be larger than life
I need a hero
Bleeding silence from a sphere behind my soul
Through twisted dreams of a muddled mind
Dismal tears of anguish loneliness in pain
The emptiness of time once again
Existence of one man  hatred with no end
Out of life
Out of pain
Out of fate
Out of clouds
Blinded by the fear  fear of the blind
Out of life
Out of pain
Out of fate
Out of clouds
A scream across my mind pierced by the fear
Deep inside my veins grasp at my existence
Blinded by the light darkness climb through
Another live just begun never see the sun
You never see the sun again
A spawn of evil and fire
Tears fall like rain from the sky
Your heart was pounding fast
I rise from the depth of soul
A vision of disaster
Let me regain control of your mind
The weakness takes control
Spoiled blood in veins
Sunken in dark shadows
Captured by illusion
Released from this nightmare
Let me wake up to find
Blackness inside what you say I have to do
The man of the dead is coming to you
Lies of redemption cleanse me out of sins
Trapped in a lie of evil skins
Hear my warnings fear your existence
Lost in an ancient mystery
Daylight breaks as blood falls down
Assassins of human history
Bound in a dream
A prisoner of hate
Bound in hell
There's no escape
Bound in a dream
A prisoner of hate
Bound in hell
There's no escape
Deceive my senses learn from the past
I was thrown to the ground
Fear the disaster wallow in darkness
Swept aside by my hate
Darkness light obscure my mind
Depths of clarity are mine
Whispers consume the air
Once again I feel my mistakes
All in the hands of energy
Nothing like before
The last piece of breath
End is here like a joke of life
Deceive my senses learn from the past
I was thrown to the ground
Fear the disaster wallow in darkness
Swept aside by my hate
Hear my warnings fear your existence
Lost in an ancient mystery
Daylight breaks as blood falls down
Assassins of human history
We will construct a new world
We will mold a new generation
We will plan the foundations
Of the new population
Before the new generations come
There are the present ones
Others were future ones also
But for those the past generations worked
The new old world
Modern primitive mind
Infinite transient soul
We will disguise the laws
Freedom without restraint
Limitation cannot resist
Freedom will be used without discretion
We will hire violence
Sex religion politics
If you want to take a look
Just turn on your monitor
The present is the futureÃÂ´s slave
And the past was also
Surprised they may discover
That the future will be also
WeÃÂ´ve seen die the old millennium
And let History take it far away
With yearning they waited
The new millenniumÃÂ´s birth
And fascinated with this new era
They broke all the rules as a celebration
IÃÂ´m a traveler in Space and Time
IÃÂ´m a Sailor of the new millennium
I will wait for you
In the storm and in the silence
I will wait for the Creation from
The travel of time
And being held at the crossroad
Of this age
I let myself to be guided
By your sight till I find
Myself with you through time
Or until I break the silence
With the sound of my last breath
Welcome to the new game
We will play the game of sleep
Which is playing not to know
Bewitchment when you live
Always celebrating
Always teching you to forget
It will be like a spell
Not to wake up ever more
Submission Inoculation
Education Domestication
All you have
There is no more
Just forget
Not remember
Wake up you who sleep
Someone is knocking at your doors
Wake up
Like a game slowly
Disconnect our minds
And steal away our innocence
For if you play to think
The spell will break
Collective mind
That is the plan
We will globalize
The enterprise
The currency and the Creed
It will be the start
Of the Great Surprise
When they see
The leaders losing
Morals faith and honesty
They will run to commit
What we had impressed
In their minds
You are God
You can fly
And go everywhere
You will be the prey
Of the Universal Mind
Global conscience
Animal soul
For frame by frame
To engrave
In every breath
In every thought
The Universal Mind
The new old world
Modern primitive mind
Infinite transient soul
Nuevo Orden Mundial
Slave of Freedom
That deceives you with the truth
Death of life
That stays with you in loneliness
Light of the dark
That guides you to nowhere
Endless end
Transforming itself without change
You are God
You can fly
And go everywhere
You will be the prey
Of the Universal Mind
Avoided knowledge
Teaching you without words
Loving hatred
Executes you without killing you
Pacific violence
Without seeing watching over you
Lost fundament
Without our Universal Mind
I have been riding
The valley is dark
Deep in the fog
I could not find you
I am so tired
I cannot go on
I feel confusion
I could not see you
I am the wind that opens up your mind
I am the noise that wakes the sleeping crowd
The Dimension that makes the subconscious free
Pain will run away
From your heartÃÂ´s moan
I have awakened
From the dream I suffered
I have found you
My grief is gone
Generations come generations go
The sun goes up and down again
My eyes are not tired of seeing
Neither my ears to hear
What it was that will be
What was done it will be done
ThereÃÂ´s no memory of those who are gone
Neither of those who will come
The twisted cannot be straightened
What is missing cannot be counted
Where wisdom flows sorrow grows
If you gather science pain is increased
Pleasure is vanity
And laughter is madness
The wise man has eyes on his forehead
And the blind in ignorance will live
And to my soul I ask
If it can the wind catch
Tell me what is fate
Remind me if it guides me
Do you think I am afraid
Do you believe I am afraid
Have you thought
That all was planned
The color of your eyes
The color of your skin
Have you ever fought
To break the spell
I am standing in the breach
I will keep making a trench
Do you think I am afraid
Tell me what is destiny
Remind me if it guides me
Do you think that I have a destiny
Have you ever thought that you have fate
Have you ever fought to change your way
Have you ever killed just to fulfill the fate
Sometimes we miss the past
And believe we get nowhere
On occasions we jump over our obstacles
Stumbling we fall with them
As if we get to like it
But we keep traversing our destiny
Leaving behind old mistakes
Wanting to forget and looking at
The finish line
Thinking we have found
What we so dream about
Facing at the turn of time
A worn face reflected
In the mirror of time
I am waiting for you
Open your doorway
Cross the gate
I am waiting for you
Walk though the bridge
Say the words
Just remember
We all wake up under the same sun
And this is nothing without you here
It's left us wondering what is this for
Just say something something you really feel
We walked this way before
Just waiting till it all comes to an end
And now it is all gone
We pray with sirens till we all fall apart
Give me strength Give me reason
We all wake up under the same sun
Make sense of this at all can't give it no more
We've walked this way before
And now that its all gone
With your heart in my hands
And the ambition of things to change
Do we understand why
Or is it just so we remember our names
Remember to breathe as it gets colder
Remember to write as you get older
Are you happy as your smile shows
To make this never go away
Somewhere anywhere everywhere
How much longer do I have to balance you
And refine you to walk with me
To long have I lived with those that hate peace
Another one and we can surely make it
With delivered phrases of pleased memories
He will remember those lines
He will remember you this time
I built this all with my own eager hands
Never been touched with velvet gloves
Or hatched in golden hay
I've left scars in a million places
To make myself explained
I sing the champion theme
Only when you know it's real
I sing these songs to express myself in feelings
My words
I sing the champion theme
My everything
Only when you know when it's real
My words
I sing the champion theme
My everything
Only when you know when it's real
Still looking for a day it all comes true
Where we sing this song together and remember 
every word that you said every king is dead 
Far away
Everything around me is fading away 
Why can't you stay hold me break me free
Everything I say and do is useless to me
Why can't we be another perfect dream
You wont forget any of those portraits
You wont forget
Can you hear the sound of my dying voice
Can you hear the sound of me trying to avoid
Another faceless dream in another scenery
You cant just fall asleep in another mystery
Everything I say and do is useless to me 
Why can't we be another perfect dream
Everything around me is fading away 
Why can't you stay hold me break me free
Bright skies on my mind 
Am I a free man or a prisoner
I spent all my life trying to survive 
Tired eyes don't feel this way
I've been awake for far too long 
I'm over feeling like the only man alive
A story with no end
Delay the senses that came to us
Father can you hear me 
Why don't you see us struggling
You won't die in my own hands
Don't be afraid just yet
to the memories of times shared
So now we'll sing just because it's beautiful
And not because it sounds sane
And now we'll sing just because it's beautiful
And not because we can
Now that your lies are all unfold
With no direction just straight ahead
Ignored will be my voice which was meant to save
Save you from a story that you wont ever forget
A story with no end
We can't be stopped
Another day passed by 
What made it different to all the others
Where are we meant to be Nowhere but here
All you can see is the breath of the night 
Its time to capture the light
Don't pretend you don't listen me
I say pick up what you have thrown away
Making things so hard to see 
People who've lost the will to live
Can you help us now
We have been watching the clocks collapse 
A bridge that folds together and no longer lasts
With opened eyes Ill no longer see 
Never forgot how things used to be
Pouring down a sky of insecurity 
When will this ever fucking end 
I'm just a silent man on his way to neverland 
Making things so hard to see 
Wipe the pain away can you help us now
This will never be the same again 
Life has spoken  I want to flea into darkness
I want to be all alone
End it silently
Who's to blame for this misery
Who's to blame
For me
Lived my life
Inside me
End my future
To be free
What is life blaming yourself
For all the sorrow
Life becomes hell
Now farewell to my emptiness
Ending my future to forget the past
Ending the sorrow
At last
My life I see no hope
Just grief
Lived my life
Inside me
End my future
To be free
Can you live with me as you all see me
Are you satisfied by what you see
Am I approved to live enough that I give
Allright that I live
Fine where I live
Am I free to be
The way I want to be
Are you sure of me the way I want to be
Are you sure of me can I be free
Can I be myself do I have to ask
How I want to live
How I should behave
Am I free
The way I want to be
Can I live in your world
Is it my world too
Am I free to be Am I free to see
Can I be myself can I do my ways
Can I live my life
How I want to be
You behave like someone I don't know
Not like the person I used to know
How did you become like this
You became what I hate the most
Liar
I watch you and think how could this be
You're not my friend nor enemy
The best in you I try to seek
But every time you're disappointing me
Growing distance
All believe will pass away
As soon as truth turns to lies
When promises are not being made
A friendship slowly dies
We are the ones who tooke the blame
And sealed our fate
The hate is not forgotten
It stabs us in the back
Forever hold in darkness
It hurts us every step
And then they were here
To spew their fate
Eyes dieing broken glass
For us already it's too late
I don't know you
Hate is manipulated
Can't you see
We are the ones who took the blame
And sealed our fate
Ever seen the day rise
In a bright sky
All hope rose high
Cause the gods would smile
Ever seen the day die
Into a dark night
Took all chance of hope away
And sealed your fate
Come home come shelter safe and warm
They promise you passion undying love
You'll give they'll take
Until there's none
You think your nightmare's ended
It's just begun
To late regrets
It's too late
They've got you entangled
Always
Exhale inhale
Insanity
They're you you'll be
What they want you to be
Divine capture
Divine capture
You must understand
Suffering
Is a part
Of life
Find power find strength
Within yourself
Escapeing the darkness
The shadowlands
There's hope around you
It's in yourself
Divine capture
You hide yourself behind a mask
A mask of hypocrisy
You don't know passion or sympathy
I disgust your greed
You're only thinking about yourself
You don't care 'bout me
Lying and cheating to reach your goal
To leave me in misery
Strive for power live for yourself
Me myself and I
I despise your existance
See right through your lies
The lie you live is not a life
When you have to hide
Behind your mask of hypocrisy
Behind your mask of lies
You make me sick
You make me sick
In the end you can't hide
Behind your lies
In the end you can't hide
Behind your disguise
Castaways abused and thrown away
Left to be a face without a name
Silently endure the pain and fear
Uncertainty is your destiny
Close your eyes
Fulfill the devil's needs forced to be
What you're not supposed to be
Torn apart between hate and fear
Angel smiles
To hide your bitter tears
A victim of wealth and poverty
Live amongst sexual brutality
Ones inside escaping is too late
Live your life
Playing angel's masquerade
Mental violation
Daily fornication
Living nightmares endlessly
An angel never to be
Angel's masquerade
Angel's masquerade
It's my way inflicting myself pain
I'm so in love with myself today
In preparation of my suffocation
I hide myself from the light of day
My fantasy becomes reality
Make me fulfill my destiny
My desire is making me a liar
What I do is not for you to see
In darkness in secrecy
I play a game that's only meant for me
On my own inside the danger zone
Giving myself the rush where I for long
Stronger than me addicted to the thrill
I thrust my head and shake my hand
And bring myself to the promised land
Feeling high in my tourniquet
Penetrating my fist
Feel the rush loosing my control
Here I cum here I go
Masturbate
Ejaculate
Adrenaline
Suffocate
Here I am alone and fading away
A shadow of what I used to be
Who cares for me
Am I still a part of humanity
Days go by
They seem like years
Each day
Is filled
With my
Old tears
Is there still a reason for me to stay
Another season
Another day
Here I am alone and faded away
My shadow is all that's left of me
Who cares for me
I am no more a part of humanity
Salt water is drowning my eyes
Inside me my heart seems to die
Silently I bare my sorrow
My burden my secret to hide
Feelings so twisted
Confusion and hate
I must not think this way
Live my own life
An anger that won't go away
Inside me until my last day
Wounds that won't heal in my mind
A pain forever to stay
I am free I control my own destiny
I control my life
Feelings so twisted
Confusion and hate
I must not think this way
Live my own life
To leave the past behind
Takes his life
For he must die
To be with her
In endless time
Her face he sees still clearly
Her skin so soft and warm
No longer is she near him
Her tender smile is gone
They can not imagine
His pain and suffering
Each day he has to live
With only memories
A life now filled with grief
So suddenly destroyed
She's taken out of reach
He's siucked into a void
Escape this emptiness
With her he wants to be
Ending this lonely life
Embrace her endlessly
Takes his life
For he must die
To be with her
In endless timeAaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh
Day so dark full of dust
You stand out and watch out
You work so hard here right now
You run for you life
And you know where they come
Bombs falling down
Every day and every night
You stand out in fire
Rivets fall all explode
Come and bring you down
Crying out all of you

Don't let them pry you from each people don't do
Let the fire burn for you and ever  give it all
You see Come on don't you see
Oh it looks like a nightmare but it was real
When you feel in the night taken by your sight
You turn out the light and start to cry
Oh don't you see
I do it all only for you
'Cause I love you like your manless man
You left me
I'm only aching so for you
Yeah you banished me like a fool
'Cause I do only for love
Oh don't you see
I love you real but my time will show
Through the man who walked my second life
'Cause I do only for love
Grippin' A Heart

Grippin' A Heart
Like I will
'Cause I do only for love
Grippin' A Heart

Screaming out of you
Get the point and all
And you must see yeah
Said you do only for love
Grippin' A Heart
Oh don't you see right
The people laughing about me
When they see what you doin' to me
You left me
Since this day I've never loved
'Cause only you who spoiled the love
'Cause I do only for love
Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart
Grippin' A Heart

On the street you're the world's bestofall
All that can fear this what they see
Rulers Must Come

In town you're met so tough
There they are that's running wild
On the street you're the world's bestofall
All that can fear this what they see
Dark dust crumbled old black rocks

Any day you'll work alone for the second strain
The work in done and you're going home
Home for for the night
Take your machine and drove in town
To take this ground down
You take so much

When our time is done
Certain as the grave
You can see it come Your wave
And everybody floats to its sound
Everybody floats to its sound
Everybody here floats to itssound
I felt my voice broken
Looking for a sound for every word
By searching for a touch from the soul
I've lost my place
I carry the burden
The voice inside knows no love anymore
Time out
I'm out
Shut up
I'm out
You fix it if it's broken
You heal it if it's sick
Some days never end
Some days are never born
Should I surrender
Should I travel to your side
You're the coldest December
But I'm your coldest night
Yeah
Shut up
Time out
I'm out
I never glow
You never listen
And I just can't pretend
Why don't you burn me alive
You get what you want
You want what you get
Is that the best you can do
You can take all with you
Should I surrender
Should I travel to your side
You're the coldest December
But I'm your coldest night
How can you not see
We are the same
ITS TOO LATE TO STOP
PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
NEED YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
I FALL FOR YOUR LINES
OH IT STINGS IT STINGS IT STINGS And you know
Hold the needle right
My heaven can wait
It burns all night
While I dream awake
Like fire every moment is floating
Its over flowing and Im sinking DOWN
Like the earth is crashing down on me
CAN YOU HEAR ME SCREAM
BESIDE HER MY WORLD IS GETTING BLANK
SHES A LIAR Shes a liar
AND SUDDENLY ALL MY FRIENDS DISAPPEAR
SHES A LIAR SHES A LIAR
How far can you get

PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND ME
NEED YOUR ARMS AROUND ME

OH IT STINGS IT STINGS IT STINGS And you know

While I dream awake
BESIDE HER MY WORLD IS GETTING BLANK

And suddenly all my friends DISAPPEAR
SHES A LIAR SHES A LIAR
How far can you get

Shes a liar SHES A LIAR
 Hear the sound 
 Im leaving Tonight 
This is the moment that I leave you in here
Hear the sound hear the sound hear the sound
This is the moment that I leave you GOODBYE
No one knows how much this means
I feel every note weve done
Were still the ones
No damage done
My friends
This means so much to me
But the road ends here
Hold your fire
Hold your positions
I still count on you my friend
But I just want to sleep away
I feel every song we've done
I feel every word I sing
I would crawl to the end of the tunnel
But Im sure you'd never do the same
Were still the ones
No damage done
My friends
This means so much to me
My road ends here
Hold your fire
Hold your positions
I still count on you my friend
But I just want to sleep away
My road ends here
Were all so cold
Were all so cold
No one knows how much this means to me
Somewhere near the end
And by the time you see this through
Remember this day
Remember today
Hold your fire
Hold your positions
I still count on you my friend
But I just want to sleep away
My road ends here
Were all so cold
Were all so cold
Do you remember what it was like to feel alone
Dragging me through hell at my weakest hour
Like I'm nothing
Tell me tell me how you really feel
It's your choice to lose your state of mind
Your own free will your own free will
Force fed lies
Force fed failures
Force fed dreams that fall apart
Force fed lies
When I lose control of all I hold
Force fed failures
My life will slowly fade to black
And I finally realize
I am the one that is in control
The world never stood a chance
And now I understand
This is all worthless
This is all worthless
Unworthy unworthy
Everything that you've asked me to be I've lost
And now I'm running around in circles
I've been sleepless
Force fed lies
Force fed failures
Force fed dreams that fall apart
Force fed lies
Force fed dreams with a new start
Torn down and abandoned
This shell of a body fails me now
I've dipped my cup in the fountain of youth
A feeble attempt soon forgotten
All sense of reality has been removed
Now I crave for something more
How profound this state of life
Like a cancer it ate me alive
Oh the irony for I am the culprit
I am the victim yet I am the culprit
I am the victim and now I am the culprit
This is the great divide
I have created the fault line
This is the great divide
And I have created the fault line
My time has come what have I done
I've lived to account for these sins of old
My days are done I'm calling out
But this voice it fails me now
This is the great divide
I have created the fault line
This is the great divide
And I have created the fault line
Bow to me the cowardly
Crown me king of the vile
See how you've fallen so far
Pursuing foul endeavors to find who you are
And I know you think that time will heal all
But you're falling faster your throne is shaking
When will you ever learn to face this fear
You're screaming out for help
But I can't hear you no I can't hear you now
Don't turn your back away from the sky
You walk the path of hypocrisy
Evil has crowned you king
And now when it's all said and done
You will be made low
Cast to the depths of the sea
Deceitful tongue I'm calling your bluff
They'll watch as I rip you out
Deceitful tongue I'm calling your bluff
I'll bury your throne in the sand
This is your chance for redemption
To right the wrongs of affliction
This is your chance for redemption
To right the wrongs of affliction
Deceitful tongue I'm calling your bluff
The world will know you're corrupt
See how you've fallen so far
Pursuing foul endeavors to find who you are
And I know you think that time will heal all
I never had to be anything
Until I saw myself in the mirror
At that point what I saw was lost hope
And knew there was time for a change
This world will be forgotten
Just don't leave it empty now
This world will be forgotten
Just don't leave it empty now
We realize where these colors take us
They're bleeding through the canvas
Into something more distinctive
These thoughts grow into newfound efforts
And continue to be unsatisfied
And I don't wanna live like this again
I thought you said it would be so simple
And I can't continue to live like this
Because my own plans aren't so wishful
Because my own plans aren't so wishful
But I'll take the path where my Maker leads me
And strive to be a tool in His hands
I've returned to a city rebuilt
Only to watch it fall again
How entirely common is it for one to retreat
Ignoring every sign from the depths of proof
You have truly seen miracles
But still question my existence every day
I've seen Your name be used to gather a profit
We've all sold God
For this halfhearted formula
Bearing what we want from this earth
Then coming back to You for answers in the end
When will our youth break through struggle
I'm guilty yet forgiven
Oh how we take for granted the second chance
We've all sold God
For this halfhearted formula
Bearing what we want from this earth
Then coming back to You for answers in the end
We've all sold God
For this halfhearted formula
Bearing what we want from this earth
Then coming back to You for answers in the end
I've returned to a city rebuilt
Only to watch it fall again
When will this cycle end
When will this cycle end
When will this cycle end
Death will hold nothing against us
Death will hold nothing against us
I see a revolution bound for freedom
Taking hold of what's rightfully theirs
The only path we see is forward
And our torches stay held high
Break down these walls
Stand up and reach out
And realize that you're not alone
I know we won't be shaken
This is the path we've taken
We will move forward
We know we're not alone
They will see it in your eyes
They will see it in your actions
Open the gates
Our youth will avenge this evil
Open the gates
And let your spirit free
I know we won't be shaken
This is the path we've taken
Can you receive the truth alone
We will move forward
We know we're not alone
They will see it in your eyes
They will see it in your actions
Stand up and stand tall
And hold your torch high
See your future is written in the sky
I see a revolution bound for freedom
Taking hold of what's rightfully theirs
The only path we see is forward
And our torches stay held high
A common outlook that's so misunderstood
You've lost all faith in yourself
Is this the life that you hoped for
Is this the life that you made
Death rests at the tip of your tongue
Your words spread like poison across the horizon
Death rests at the tip of your tongue
Your words spread like poison on their lives
You believe we're so easily misguided
Always bringing false hope
Look at me I need to know how you got this far
All your decisions have left you for dead
The crown of apathy rests on your head
And you've yet to be phased
The crown of apathy is burned on your soul
Is when your world falls apart on you
And you have nothing left to lose
You want to bring back the ones that you abused
These bitter years of this life you're living
They have nothing to prove
Making it known you can't make up your mind
Making it known you can't make up your mind
Making it known you can't make up your mind
Making it known you can't make up your mind
We fall apart to get back up
We fall apart to get back up
Born to be broken
Born to be broken
This is a human uproar
These are the plagues that contain our souls
Even with these constant reminders
But the immoral overlays the benefits
What have they sold us
What have they sold us here
That it's just a phase
We listen we accept thinking it will pass
We listen we accept thinking it will pass
I have discovered yet another analytical failure
And its agony flows through our veins
It's not enough it's not enough it's not enough
I won't settle any longer
This is the point when you suffer
We fall apart to get back up
We fall apart to get back up
Eternity awaits me
And I know that we're all broken vessels
Trying to find our way in life
To the ends of the earth
I've searched high and low to no avail
My time was wasted
Why did I ever place my faith
In things that couldn't save me Couldn't save me
Everything was all for nothing
Every breath I took in vain
Everything was all for nothing
Empty words that hold no weight
And now I understand and now I understand
That it was all in vain
Here I kneel before my Maker reaching for words
Reaching for words
Ears to hear and eyes to see
But never comprehending
Ears to hear and eyes to see
But never understanding
Eternity awaits me
And I know that we're all broken vessels
Trying to find our way in life
Eternity awaits me
Why did I ever place my faith
In things that couldn't save me Couldn't save me
Everything was all for nothing
Every breath I took in vain
Everything was all for nothing
Empty words that hold no weight
Time stands still
I'm running out of breath
Everything around me breathes except for me
How do we make up something so insincere
They make our actions and voice we speak
Who else is tired of decaying
I haven't lived for far too long far too long
When my life starts to stand for nothing
Maybe I can explain it through a song
Another path to take another setting sun
Where are we leading each other
Is it hope or disease
Give me a sign give me a reason to prosper
Give me a sign give me a reason to prosper
Devouring every step forward that I make
I need to bring myself to safety
I need to find my way back home
If only I could dine with the pigs
When did the swine become something so tasteful
I'm on my way home covered in filth
But that's the way they'll take me
Oh that's the way they'll take me
Take me so I can know your plan
Collect all my fears in the palm of your hand
I've turned away from the past
And I don't plan to be a light to be a light
Because I want to be something brighter
And more prone to ignite more prone to ignite
I want to be fireThis is where youre conceived
This is where you are born
Here is where you will fail
You can build your box here
Heres your mind numbing job
This is where you will fall
The shredder helps you dispose of their corpses
I love my cubicle my little beige cubicle
I love my cubicle my little padded cubicle
I love my cubicle my little prison cubicle
Escalate and execute your brutal demise
Love you in your emails
Love you in your memorandums
Love you in your meetings
Loving your strategic plans
Love you in projected sales
Love you 'til your suit bleeds
Love you as you fall from the 83rd floor
I love my cubicle my little beige cubicle
I love my cubicle my little padded cubicle
I love my cubicle my little prison cubicle
Escalate and execute your brutal demise
No point no desire
No choice but to riot
No life no hope
No vision for the future
No sex no parachutes
No escape at least for you
No sharp instruments no fun
No control no fucking way
I love my cubicle my little beige cubicle
I love my cubicle my little padded cubicle
I love my cubicle my little prison cubicle
Escalate and execute your brutal demise
On a train going down
Dont care if you go up in smoke
You think youre better prove it now
Trading currency for your ghost
Power of berserk compels you
Time for fraud and ruin
If God is money I am the Devi I am the Devil
If God is money I am counterfeit Youve been had
Bite sizes oblivion gorge yourself
Annihilation spoon fed prescribed amplified
Power of berserk compels you
Time for fraud and ruin
If God is money I am the Devi I am the Devil
If God is money I am counterfeit Youve been had
Scapegoat Strung up Bankrupt Forgotten
They say you burn plastic baby
But where do you cut the line
Its so hard to stand up baby
When you aint got a spine
If God is money I am the Devi I am the Devil
If God is money I am counterfeit Youve been had
The Great wrought Youve been swindled

Crystalline bunnies
Celebrity fixation
On the tiles of the girls' room
A furry crucifixion
Trivial play thing
And he likes your implants
Makin his moves
While holding your hair back
Smear it on dance with fear
Charge it up defibrillatorclear
Pop lolly spite dust
Defibrillatorclear
Sweet chemical boy
Cold stiff and jaded
Mad scientist joy
Made another belated
Our grand palace
Where the most beautiful rooms
Are the most vacant
Let's go to la la la la and get naked 
Buy me a diamond ponyÃÂ  then get uncensored
Now all my bunny friends
Are pregnant or in prison
Dead or wearing suits
In rehabilitation
Kept some in deep freeze
Or buried in the garden
I like the road kill near
defibrillatorclear
Smear it on dance with fear
Charge it up defibrillatorclear
Pop lolly spite dust

Locust with name tags
This is US verses YOU
No saliva only spit
Now holy men worship mud
Corrosion is justice suicide entertaining
Choose the option least painless are you ready
BULLET PROOF BABY
HELL YEAH BULLET PROOF BABY

My repugnance is my rite
Welcome to Earth turning paradise to hell
You're smashed to pieces held together with lies
What's on your mind won't be your salvation

HELL YEAH BULLET PROOF BABY
HELL YEAH BULLET PROOF BABY
Bullet proof baby baby baby baby
HELL YEAH BULLET PROOF BABY

Dancing like fools as we go to Hell
But at least we're getting herded together

When the servers have haemorrhaged
And the bandwidth is slashed
And the screaming binary is reduced to ash
You will know us
When the skyscrapers smoulder
And the lore is in smoke
You will know us
Daddy buy me
Where the code becomes curses
And systems become blasphemy
You will know us
You will know us
You will know us
You will know us
You will know us by our trail of static
Daddy buy me a pixel pony
Community becomes commodity
Agitate and add technology
Smashed surveillance 'coz I kicked in the lenses
Daddy buy me
You will know us
You will know us
You will know us
You will know us by our trail of static
Daddy buy me a pixel pony
My ghost with a knife gets the job done right
I do not want make friends
I only want to make corpses
So fast on your silky toes
So hard to catch little muses
Keep biting your pillow
Soon you're gunna be a shining star
Just think about the money
You're only doing it for exposure
JailBait Hey Hey Hey
I got your scalpel Givin' you a new look
JailBait Hey Hey Hey
Dissection Party Swallow my hook
Your curse becomes apathy
The quiet and deadliest virus
My curse is coveting
Mortal sin gets between us
Don't let it stand in our way
The suicidal brush stroke cross seals the lie
Coax out the killer in you
You're only honest when you're about to die
JailBait Hey Hey Hey
I got your scalpel Givin' you a new look
JailBait Hey Hey Hey
Dissection Party Swallow my hook
I know you want it
By the way you're playing
But are you begging
Or are you preying
My ghost with a knife
My ghost with a knife gets the job done right
My ghost with a knife gets the job done right
JailBait Hey Hey Hey
I got your scalpel Givin' you a new look
JailBait Hey Hey Hey
Dissection Party Swallow my hook
You know you're gunna get it
by the way I'm playing
there's not use in begging
no hope in praying
Some will be drawn to violence
Others will swarm like bees
Weave in her hair
Like wolves to the bride
Wear her like clothes
Stitch closed their eyes
The hounds are closing inshe is open wide
Say ahhhh  all my dreams have fire
Say ahhhh  all my dreams have fire
Amour I forgive you
Amour let me kiss you
Amour let me place you
In my mouth piece by piece
Riding on high my stallion
Carving up clouds with his hooves
I hunt the wolves
Filled up with you
I spill them all
'Til dawn wash anew
Amour i forgive you
Amour let me kiss you
Amour let me place you
In my mouth piece by pieceOur story will read
The great darkness prevailed
For we are doomed to taking love by force
It tastes like stale sweat
shatter hopes and broken bones
Time has done us in
Enough is enough
I cant recall those tears we cried
As we read that lullabye
We will read this lullabye
And sleep that long goodnight
It swarms around me like wildfire
It waits beyond meaning
This hoard of hate and teeth
You cant see the hand that hold you
Silent and still
Youll never find a way to escape yourself
It swarms around me like wildfire
Letting go of everything
A slave to it
And the world moves on
Never to receive Never to return
A slave to it all
And the world moves on
I cant slip away
Days full of fools killing fools
Wash it away
Let it all wash away
Hold the front
Our glory will be written in blood
Our hearts wait for judgement
Collapse every fucking system
Tear down everything
Sharpen your axes
Don't waste your breath
We know how this will end 
You can feel it moving against the wind
Waiting for it to come crashing down on me
Then we will lose ourselves in this
Feeling the flesh back from our wounds
Drowning in our own skin
All that was buried within
No hope for salvation
What are you to me
My fists are broken and bruised
Trying to remove the poison from inside of me 
Bury my body deep into the ground
Bury my strength with the love I leave behind
You are not ready for what's coming
Your voices are silent beneath the static
Staring at the shattered pieces of your body
That lay across the floor
The memory will haunt our souls until
we are withered and buried in this earth
A pattern is revealed
Truth be told
Ive never loved anything but my own demise
So we carve into the sky
And set free the light
As brothers we fought held down against our will
As fathers we fought but learned nothing more
As lovers we lost our faith
I tore down this wall around my heart
We played with fire
We risked it all
But luck and love have gone to the other son
Let it all fall down upon the other son
Our bones we left in the soil
As brother we lost
As fathers we lost
One step from white to black
One step from here to beyond
One step from life to death
And the night whispers the names
Of fallen and damned one
By the voice of the wind
Fallen with no remorse
Pale hands are searching for
Sanity below the melting snow
Thousands of hearts bleed
Thousand of souls dissolve in dirt
Yellow pages of the book of lies
Promise a future full of light
Harassing simple minds
Exploring new horizons of illusions
Ropes around our necks
Are like crosses behind our backs
And we crucify ourselves
To save our souls from despair
Behind a mask with no eyes
There is the monolith of a face
I can not escape from
Your abhorrent embrace
Are you my verdict
Or are you my curse
Deep within myself
I feel the hatred grows
Cataracts
The fear of madness
Devouring from inside
Eclipsing the light
So many years of pain
My punishment is not over yet
They will never forgive
They will never forget
So fill my veins with poison
Fill my heart with fear
Fill my throat with scream
Fill my blind eyes with tears
I stare into my face
We are connected by solitude
Together tied in chains of despair
Not a gleam of  Hope 
Mentally enslaved nameless
Having no future and no past
Mirrors call
Mirrors melt
Mirrors take me out of here
What the silver moon sings about
in eternal collapse at night
what i am looking for in the empty skies
empty like me
A Swallow of freedom sticks in my throat
When the sun goes down
In the mirrors of despair
There is only my face
Devil's in my brain
Everything's the same
Distant rising sun
Destiny be done
All this waiting is playing on my mind
Commiserating
The end I'll never find
I've lost ray faith I've lost my faith
Why must a man fade away
Gone yes I am to fade away
Is there having
There is no guarantee
Overstating
The place I'll never see
I've lost my faith I've lost my faith
Why must a man fade away
Gone yes I am to fade away
Devil's in my brain
Everything's the same
Distant rising sun
Destiny be done
I was born to be the restless kind
No patience for wastin' time
Start thisikin' 'bout the wars we wage
No use Jest turn the page
Silent tear endless fear
Don't wanna lose the way we are
So I've been waitin' for
A sign from heaven above me
A sign that comes from the stars
A white light to shine down upon me
I've waited so long
 Give me a sign
I've been caught inside a mystery
Black magic never got to me
Always payin' for eternal sin
Been around and back again
Don't wanna lose the way we are
So I've been waitin' for
A sign from heaven above me
A sign that comes from the stars
A white Sight to shine down upon me
I've waited  Oh Lord
 Give me a sign
In my mind taint glow of the city lights
Neon jungle made of cold concrete
Lead us both into temptation oh
Behold the den of iniquity
Nightwind deliver me
Lonely road never set me free
In my way I'll keep on moving on
On the highway to Roppongi
Well it's my way to keep on travelin' on
On the highway to Roppongi
Darkest hearts beat strong in the city babe
Empty promisesbroken soul
Niglwind deliver me
Lonely road never gonna set me free
In my way I'll keep on moving on
On the highway to Roppongi
Well it's my way to keep on travelin' on
On the highway to Roppongi
Cuz' every lime I've tried to run away
Something's always beggin' me 10 slay
It's callin' from the darkness
Every time I've tried to get away
Well Somethin' here is beggin' me to stay
Arms are reachin' to hold me
Nightwind deliver me
Lonely road never set me free
In my way I'll keep on moving on
On the highway to Roppongi
Well it's my way to keep on travelin' on
On the highway to Roppongi
Well it's my waykeep on keepin' on
It's ma waykeep on movin' on movin' on
My way to keep on movin' on
On the highway to Roppongi
You always think about the things I said
But never notice why I
Can't reach the words
You're sending over my head
I shouldn't even try
But all of these feeling till my mind
So why are my legs so hard to find
You're over my head
Keep reaching
But the lines have all gone dead
Over my head
Keep reaching
But the lines haw all gone
I can't slop thinkin' 'bout the mess I've made
It's made a mess of me too
Over knee deep into this farce we wade
I'll drown before you do
But all of these feelings fill my soul
So why am I down here in this hole
You're over my head
Keep reaching
But the lines have all gone dead
Over my head
Keep reaching
But the lines have all gone dead
There in front of me right before my eyes
Show their face then disappear
And every photograph frames my great mistake
Now a broken man with nothin' left to break
Can't afford the cost
Every single baited breath I take
Reminds me of the one that got away
The one that got away
In the magazine wear the painted smile
Faces staring all the while
And I turn the page but never turn away
Now a silent man with nothin' left to say
In a sense I'm lost
Every single baited breath I take
Reminds me of the one that got away
The one that got away
I don't wanna lose I don't wanna feel
I don't wanna make the same mistakes
I don't wanna dream I don't wanna learn
I don't wanna make the same mistakes I made
She got away
I've been waitin' wait in' for so long
Recreating the things that I've done wrong
And ever time I see her every single day
I'm tryin' to find the reasons
We went our separate ways
All this lime I've been falling
Wasted time
Falling down falling down again
Falling down I've been falling down again
I've been searchin' searchin' half my life
Always knowing the strongest will survive
And everything around me everything I see
I never even realized the strongest one was me
All this time I've been falling
Precious time
Falling down falling down again
Falling down I've been falling down again
Every single day
Every move I make
I'm falling down I'm falling down
Did you ever feel you're headed for a change
Cuz' you wanna know how to breathe again
Sewing patches on your heart
Never knew it'd be so hard
Do you want to learn how to dream once more
Did you ever think you'd find that open door
When tiny pieces of your soul
Break apart and lose control
Sometimes it feels like
I'm slipping away I'm slipping away
So long I've had to hold on
I'm slipping away
Have you tried to see the light behind your eyes
And the mirror pane reflecting only lies
Puzzled pieces of your heart
Losing faith and torn apart
Sometimes I feel like
I'm slipping away I'm slipping away
So long I've had to hold on
I'm slipping away
All the reasons seems to go through my mind
Why you do the things you do
After all that we've been throughthis can't end
Bless the demon keep my false hope alive
So won't you
Tell me one more lie
Slowly let the soul in me die
All the madness wants to go to my head
But I won't let you leave me this way oh no
Can't we make it last just a little bit longer
Who knows maybe one more lie
Just might make us stronger
So won't you
Tell me one more lie
I like it when ya
Slowly let the soul in me die
In need ya to
Tell me one more lie
So silent now I watch you you're sleeping
Inside your heart is beating'
Like raindrops I'm failing
I hear your voice it's calling
I will remember
This love could last longer
I believe in what we are
I believe we can touch the stars
And I will love von better
Treat you better I will
You better believe
You know that I've been waiting so lonely
To show you you're the only
Temptations like fire
And as the flames burn higher
I will remember
This low could last forever
I believe in what we are
I believe we can touch the stars
And I will love you better
Treat you better I will
You better believe
I will remember
This love could last forever
Though hard times seem to be pressed against us
I see a light ahead now
And the time has come for each of us to go
And learn
And become what we have been dreaming of
Just get me out
Today is yesterday's tomorrow
And we might not be here tomorrow
We have to make the best of every second we have
This could be the last time I breathe in
That I breathe in
That I breathe in
That I breathe in
Because there are things upon this earth
we as human beings are not meant to endure
It makes me sick to know that my life will be 
represented by the world we are in now
Get me out Just get me out of this world
Everyday it's getting harder to find the energy
Get me out Just get me out of this world
Everyday it's getting harder to find the energy
Today is yesterday's tomorrow
And we might not be here tomorrow
We have to make the best of every second we have
This could be the last time Iwe breathe in
It makes us sick to know that our lives will be 
Get me out get me out get me out
It makes us sick to know that our lives will be 
Get me out get me out get me out
I am the author of my life
They make us who we are in this world
Making changes everyday but it seems so empty
I try so hard but I am only a man
before they sting my eyes
Like time has shown me so many times before
I struggle to find who I am anymore
All I can be
I am the author of my life
Friendship is the best example of these
And the people who have meant so much to us
I'm reaching out for the first time 
This is my call to the world 
this is my call to the world 
I'm reaching out 
There will never be a last time 
Go and learn because there's things in me 
that I've seen inside us all 
Now you will learn that its day to day 
that's how I've learned these things 
I'm reaching out 
And there will never be a last time 
This is my call to the world 
Seeing as your the giant and I'm just little me 
I will just stand here in complacency 
and not say a Fucking thing 
This is my life my voice is to be heard 
This is a world that we all share 
I refuse to stand here 
towered with fear any longer 
You are you and I am me 
That will always and forever be 
I refuse to live under your tyranny 
We're all here to live our lives 
I won't live in fear any longer 
It's the steps in life we take 
that make us who we are
This is who we'are the ones of sacrifice 
We will not be judged for we have lost so much 
So let's go to the deepest' place in your heart 
and find the one thing that you want most 
are you capable enough to capture it
and change hearts and change time 
Waking up to the same scenery leaves me empty 
Doorways becoming heavier hourly 
And I know its just apart of getting older 
And you said The greatest reward is of sacrifice
Doorways becoming lighter hourly 
This is who we are the ones of sacrifice 
This is who we are the ones of sacrifice
Strength comes in time 
The strength to push me through these days 
the strength to find an epiphany 
I have learned these things from barriers 
trial and tribulation 
And running from the crumbling edges 
that present themselves on our paths in life
I will survive 
I know that everything I have in my life 
is from those who truly care or resent me
Life is so eventful and the things we learn 
It gets so frustrating when people build walls 
can we tear them down 
We can tear them down 
Oh how cruel can'this world be 
Can we grow Can we learn Can we breathe 
If I must lay myself to sleep am I guaranteed 
I have lived my life my choices exact To a tee 
And no one can take that away from me 
Life My life was comfortable 
Blind pride The time has come for me 
Will I see When the things change in this world 
we can't always change with them 
But look ahead and find those things 
I can see it in your eyes your captivated 
There comes a moment in each others lives 
where we must face the facts
that the people we love and the things we do 
can't always be the things that we strive for
brought me back to square one 
Now I'm running on empty 
Only you could pick me up 
without thinking twice 
you wrapped your arms around me 
When we find truth inside ourselves 
it's hard not to run away 
But we must capture and embrace 
It's how we truly live our lives 
We will be everything we have been dreaming of 
When I look in the mirror what I see 
is the only thing that I can be 
I come to you now defenses down 
Defenseless now 
When you look at me I want to be 
everything you want to see 
I come to you now defenses down 
Defenseless now
this will pass and things will change 
Waiting Embracing calm before the storm 
Wondering what the future may have in store 
As I ponder these things what's happening to me 
My breathing is normal my eyes are open 
but nothings in front of me 
I have been here before 
but I can't seem to find my way out this time 
Will I be Back Can we make our way back 
I knew these things happened often 
but what happened to me 
It's reality now because 
this must mean that I've lost everything 
Can we make our way back 
I know that this shield from the sun will lift 
We will walk the brittle lines 
and our name will stand the test of time 
This will bring everything to light
Forever is the focus we've put on these dreams 
In desolation I pick myself up everyday 
How the hell am I standing here 
I know I'm a martyr I'm not asking for sympathy 
I won't I can't join in This is for me 
Few have tried so hard to reignite the blaze 
we've held in our hearts for so long 
But those days are all long gone 
has been living for us makes us sick inside 
Now I push these stones to you 
Let the air return to my lungs 
the essence of our most sought after lives 
Now we sleep Why are we so tired 
Exhaustion just blurs everything 
Now we must wake and seize 
Invigorate once again and embrace everything 
Everything Everything 
I find these are my darkest days 
when everything is collapsing around me 
Can we remain awake long enough to feel again 
Can we remain Awake enough to truly feel again 
And isn't it enough that every breath I give 
falls short of what this life demands 
So here I stand to capture and embrace 
everything that will come my way
Consider ruinous the impoverished
Splendid of substance 
Splendid of power 
Cohere with cannelure perverse urinate 
Infected the temporal mundane amenities
Execute the withered
Condensed orgasm since vain perspective 
Postulate simplification 
Generalize the warrant 
Immeasurable 
Obligatory ingest their own brain 
Death is our complacence 
Period to traverse their cathedra
Period to salvage the exiguous 
Same Sovereignty
Reprobate brave the death 
Begin to mortgage his life 
Heaven sense the distress
Tartarus sense the indulgency 
No more holy spirit perish yourself
Only blasted triumphant perish yourself 
Eternally mutilate high structure 
Still nature controlling the earth 
Sanguinary your resource 
All points in the sphere inherence dejected 
Transcendental sacred
Period perennially pass 
New phlegm will be done 
The wrath struck abuse 
Hematic send his breast to the warmth
Perceive sympathetic that contumacy 
Conclusion of your fucking tick
Tandukmu merangkai teori
Umbar legalisasi sepihak 
Diskriminasi sampai ujung
 Pahala hanya omong kosong 
Tiadakanlah timbal balik
Aliran koersi menambal 
Suntikan yang tidak sporadis
Otak bangkai merajalela 
Senja dan buta sama saja
Ribuan jemari tak berkuku 
Cawan emas untuk bersulang
Setelah menarik yang kau anggap salah 
Fasik untuk menjawab undangan surgamu
Parasit kutuntut musnah 
Hilangkan luka doa api yang menyertaimu 
Semiotika kebutaan 
Bacot khotbah dan injil beralaskan kepalsuan 
Substansi busuk suara hampa 
Bakar dan kami merayakan kehancuranmu
Parasit kutuntut musnah
Was echoed welcome to our new epoch

Bow down the obsolete well challenge it loudly

Serangan terkutuk akhirat
Untuk menghapuskan duka dan sengsara 
Menyelamatkan para kaum pasif

Produce the paralyzed bureaucracy sorrowful 
Counting for all welfare missed 
Counting for all justice missed 
Neatness is blind

I have been waiting for you
In the back of beyond
I don't know what I become
Floating softly
Flying up
I don't know what I become
But I feel so good this time
Like there's no more gravity
Body and mind
Different things
From faroff I hear your cry
Floating softly
Split in two
I'm flying high
Black procession in the rain
Lovely brand new hearse
Everyone cries
Everyone cares
Or maybe just pretends
Oh it's your big moment by the way
Cold at heart
Indifference
Thought they were your best friends
Tears  flowers
From the one
You never would expect
Oh it's your big moment by the way
Would you like to tell them something
Do you remember what you said
When I looked into your eyes
For the first time
I know you're not quite ready yet
But there's nothing to be afraid of
In your Summerland
On the wall
In the waiting room
Still life in a frame
At the end of the corridor
Someone screams your name
Oh it's your big moment by the way
Would you like to tell him something
Do you remember what you said
When I looked into your eyes
For the first time
I know you're not quite ready yet
But there's nothing to be afraid of
In your Summerland
I can't describe what's going on with me
A different nature moving rapidly
Being halfway here
And halfway somewhere else
My whole life starts to flash in front of me
I'm overwhelmed in joy quiet and peace
All words I know are threedimensional
I feel all troubles are gone
I feel all troubles are gone
Timelessness
Ineffability
I glimpse the spirits of my relatives
I see the others
The being of light
Shifting through a tunnel long and dark
I regret all those things that I had left undone
And I wish I could fix everything that was wrong
I wish I could tell you how sorry I am
This is not the end
That I'm scared to life
I'm scared to life
I'm scared to life
I'm scared to life
I know we're passing by
See the shadows of our own
Apart from where we are
We still believe
And raise our hopes
We're locked up alone
Going nowhere
Waiting for the dawn
And just like shooting stars
We sleep in flames
Until we burn up
Until we burn up
How many lives we live
Poised between all heaven and earth
How many times we die
Trying for rebirth with a different mask
No matter where we go
Souls adrift never say goodbye
So easy to forget
Remove from consciousness
All instances
That used to be significant
I never thought those things
Would have such meaning
Until he asked me to
Give them back
What will survive of me
A cardboard box with thoughts inside
What will survive of me
My little escapes from real life
What will survive
And what will I take
To the land of endless ones
If I sever the past
It will be so dark here
We want to be loved
Loved for what we are
We want to be saved
But our final truth depends on time
So what will survive of me
A cardboard box with thoughts inside
What will survive of me
My little escapes from real life
What will survive
And what will I take
To the land of endless ones
If I sever the past
It will be so dark here
When I met The Ferryman
He smiled to me
Could swear I saw this smile before
You have to choose  he said
And then you may return
You'll get another chance to revive
If you decide to keep
Your memories from the past
By all else you must be forgotten
If you let me take your mind
If you let me take your soul
In their hearts you'll stay forever
Your choice
The time is now
At the crossroads of your afterlife
The part of you must be lost
Make up your mind
Choose the side
Pick the card
Throw the coin from your mouth
Cause the time is now
I'm calling you again
Let's see what color
You win some lose some it's all the same to me 
The Ace Of Spades 
Playing for the high one dancing with the devil 
Going with the flow it's all a game to me 
Seven or eleven snake eyes watching you 
Double up or quit double stake or split 
The Ace Of Spades 
But that's the way I like it baby 
I don't wanna live for ever 
And don't forget the joker 
Pushing up the ante I know you've gotta see me 
Read 'em and weep the dead man's hand again 
I see it in your eyes take one look and die 
The only thing you see you know it's gonna be 
You turn a lover into just another friend 
I want to love you 
I want to make you mine 
Won't you lay it on the line 
I'm tired of playing all your foolish games 
I'm tired of all of your lies making me insane 
I dont ask for much
True would do just fine
Won't you lay it on the line 
Lay it on the line 
Lay it on the line 
Lay it on the line
Don't waste my time 
You got no right to make me wait 
We better talk girl before it gets too late 
I never ever thought you could be so unkind 
Won't you lay it on the line 
You know I love you you know it's true 
It's up to you girl what've I got to do 
Won't you lay it on the line 
Lightning smokes on the hill arise
Brought the man with the warning light
Shouting loud You had better fly
While the darkness can help you hide
Trouble's comin' without control
Noone's stayin' that's got a hope
Hurricane at the very least
In the words of the gypsy queen
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go
Get my saddle and tie it on
Western wind who is fast and strong
Jump on back he's good and long
We'll resist 'til we reach the dawn
Runnin' seems like the best defense
Stayin' just don't make any sense
Noone could ever stop it now
Show the cards of the gypsy town
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go
Shadows movin' without a sound
From the hold of the sleepless town
Evil seems to be everywhere
Heed the spirit that brought despair
Trouble's comin' without control
Noone's stayin' that's got a hope
Hurricane at the very least
In the words of the gypsy queen
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go
Sign of the gypsy queen
Pack your things and leave
Word of a woman who knows
Take all your gold and you go
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancin' with baby on her shoulder
The sun is settin' like molasses in the sky
The boy could sing knew how to move everything
Always wanting more he'd leave you longing for
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightning bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
Love me tender leaves 'em cryin' in the aisle
The way he moved it was a sin so sweet and true
Always wanting more he'd leave you longing for
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
You do
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
Black velvet and that little boy's smile
Black velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring ya to your knees
Black velvet if you please
If you please if you please if you please

Begin the day
With a friendly voice
A companion unobtrusive
Plays that song that's so elusive
And the magic music makes your morning mood
Off on your way
Hit the open road
There is magic at your fingers
For the spirit ever lingers
Undemanding contact
In your happy solitude
Invisible airwaves
Crackle with life
Bright antennae bristle
With the energy
Emotional feedback
On a timeless wavelength
Bearing a gift beyond price
Almost free
All this machinery
Making modern music
Can still be openhearted
Not so coldly charted
It's really just a question
Of your honesty
One likes to believe
In the freedom of music
But glittering prizes
And endless compromises
Shatter the illusion
Of integrity
For the words of the profits
Are written on the studio wall
Concert hall
Echoes with the sounds
Of salesmen
You're blindly pessimistic
And it makes me fucking sick
There is no hope in life
Won't be saved by your crucifix
Existence is pain
And pain is punishment
No salvation no light
Humanity equals shit
Immense pain inflicted slowly
all else fails except for death
admit defeat rise of unholy
embrace the end your last breath
The skies are black
With gods hate
This is payback
Our final fate
Seven plagues
Seven reasons to burn the heavens
Jesus Christ King of scorn
A thousand lies for every thorn
Endless pain from the day you're born
When god is dead none will mourn
Kingofscorn
Drown me in theblood of Christ
So I can seethrough God's eyes
Jesus Christ King of scorn
A thousand lies for every thorn
Endless pain from the day you're born
When god is dead none will mourn
Kingofscorn
Rip the fleshfrom my bone
Eternal miseryis all I know
Face to face with your fate
Choke and fucking rot
God cannot save you
Cant even save the son he begot
Every human being is out for themselves
We've turned this world into a living hell
Because within us all is where the devil resides
If god creates it
Man will destroy it
Accept your pain
Die in vain
Erase the human race
Break free from this disease
Every human being is out for themselves
We've turned this world into a living hell
Decay is the only constant we all deserve to die
Burn your heavens
Rip Christ's flesh
Christian wasteland
I am death
Your life fades away
As your neck breaks
Writhing constant pain
This artwork I create
Dead or alive
You're coming with me
Deprive you of your life
I decide what's right
Becoming a statistic
You will fucking die tonight
Smeared across the pavement
Removed your blood and brain
Stomp the head bereavement
Made sure you died in pain
Like sheep to the slaughter
If one thing is certain
it's that your life doesn't matter
The closer you are to me
The closer you are
To death
Deprive you of your life
I decide what's right
Becoming a statistic
You will fucking die tonight
Masticating masturbated
Genitalia all life fading
Massive blood loss
Feeds my blood lust
Ingesting your fluids
You wish to be dead
slowly dying
Blunt force trauma
Restrain repress release death
Restrain decay death erase
Through our procreating
We are degenerating
Into an evolutionary cesspool
Filth breeding filth
In a search for wealth
We've abused our basic right to reproduce
My indifference
to your suffering
Is Incomparable
To the filth that you breed
I am the crutch on which
you depend
You exist only when I reach out my hand
You've beaten natural selection
You won't beat me
Life is a vise
I can help you break free
Just take my hand
And you will see
I am the end
I am a plague
I am judgement
I am your dying day
No one can save you
No one can stop me
As the death toll rises they cower and hide
As the earth is burning they cover their eyes
I don't believe I will ever be saved
Sentenced to rot in this life this plague
Plague of life
Empty eyes
Empty inside
Only god is the blame
For all of my pain
My pain
The putrid stench of my rotting soul
Is the only thing I call my own
I must escape leave this constant pain
Or be trapped forever in eternal misery
As the death toll rises they cover their eyes
As the earth is burning they cower and hide
I don't believe I will ever be saved
Sentenced to rot in this life this plague
Only god is to blame
For all of my endless pain
Drive the nail through his palm
Singing praise of unholy psalm
Every Christian on earth dies
Burn the churches as god cries
Welcome to sinland
The paradise of the damned
You give me pleasure I give you pain
When I am done you'll never see again
There is no turning black
I'm turning black
Lost is our glorious world
Sin we explore
We enjoy your pain
And through your pain we will be reborn
To fulfill my endless desire
I enter the land of fire
To create my infernal breed
It's your blood I need
Your life is under siege
I slay you I damn the weak
To fulfill my endless desire
I throw myself into the fire
Welcome
There is no
I am the black
In my dominion I control the weak
And in vain in pain they turn the other cheek
I'm souless
In my dominion I tear their soul apart
Pure eternal hate run through my soulless heart
I'm soulless to the core I'm 666
I am your death I am the crucifix
On which you are nailed
Their pain makes me strong
I breathe from their fear
I am the one man call wrong
I laugh at their tears
I live where angels cry
I make them suffer my sin
Screams released in agony
As I undress them from skin
In my dominion blood will always reign
I damn your soul to everlasting pain
I'm soulless
I'm soulless to the core
I am your death
In the name of the father
In the name of the son
In the name of the holy ghost
Is that why you killed me
Well at least you tried
Tried to put me to rest
But I survived
I am your soul I am your master
You are my tool to bring disaster
You know I love you but that's a lie
I only need you to survive
Pray to your god you pray as you spit red
Pray to your god you god will fail and you
Will be dead
Try to ignore me but that won't do
I won't leave before I've killed you
In the name of the father
Your god is dead and I am the one
Pray to
Murder another dead found
Covered with blood
Body nailed to the ground
Murder in the first degree
Died on his knees
On every charge I am guilty
The bullets are mine
Crying dying victim crying
Tears are falling from the eye
A witness to my parricide
Mother raped beyond belief
Her head decorated the wall
On every charge I am guilty
The bullets are mine
Lying in the garden of stone
Awaiting the end
The river runs red screams of pain
Released by victims of my bullet rain
Kill killing is my drug
My gun is my god
You will suffer my slug
Another body emptied from soul
Engulfed by my infernal breath
Bloodlust over me I'm losing control
Condemned to suffer you'll rest
As you follow me into infinity
The sweet serenity is broken
By the angels weep and there will be
Bloodshed  godshed
My soul has turned to black
Nothing exist now but pain
I shall now return
Dead I will remain
And you'll follow me into my lechery
The sweet serenity is broken
By the angels weep and there will be
Bloodshed  godshed
I must be bloodfed  bloodborn
Another body bleeds from it's soul
Victim for my infernal need
I'm in control your blood in me
Condemned to suffer my insanity
And you shall lead me into obscurity
The sweet serenity is broken
By the angels weep and there will be
Bloodshed  godshed
I want to see you dead
I'll take you into the ever black
I conquer your weak soul
Flood of pain falls like rain
As I grant your eyes my evil desire
Tears you feel are tears that bleed
I rape you slow infernally
Come inside of me hear the symphony
Of the crying souls
I'll take into the ver black
Your bleeding soul I caress
Undressed from skin you cry within
On your virgin flesh I sin
Tears you fee
Come inside of me
Tears  unknown to me
Fear  unknown to me
Hanging hanging here crying
Slowly I'm dying with tears in my eyes
My worlds is turning black
And here I die crucified
What kind of father are you who betray
Are you my father creator of Earth
Did you give me birth
Do you exist Where do you hide
Now as I die
There is no god to be son to
There is no son to be god to
Why did you betray me Why didn't you save me
My world is turning black
And here I die Crucified satisfied
Close your eyes fall into the arms of Morpheus
Come below with me into my kingdom you
Will fall
Fall from your dream in a blood stream
Fall from life into my paradisal genocide
Visualize the darkest world of morbidity
My paradise a realm of lust and perversion
Close your eyes sleep forever
Close your mind Explore
With the angels
Crying weepng dying
As we go to war against your soul
Blood strained is your soul as it is lost
To my sinful lust
And bleeding you shall die so close your
Eyes and fall
Fall from
Lying under the falling rain
The urge crows in me
The sweetest taste deepest red
Caress my lips as I embrace the dead
As I suck blood
Look into my vicious eyes
Tell me if I am wicked
The necrolust grows inside
Inside my sick head
I know you rest under that flower bed
And I am going down
On a bed of roses under a clouded sky
They say you're dead so I should leave you alone
I'm so in love that I son't care
On a bed of roses under the falling rain
I rape your corpse again and again and again
Wander beneath the clouded sky
I think it's time to say goodbye
To say goodbye to my wicked world
To join the sleep of my eternal love
I go under my gun take farewell to the sun
It's time to be as one
Scars from a shattered life
Sunk into an emotional abyss
Memories of blood
Multiple voices inside of me
Dismembered personality
I'm lost in my sick head
I am paranoid will I ever be the same
Lost in void will I forever be insane
Shadowed clouded are my eyes
Buried in my disordered mind
My freedom will come when I die
Demons inside of me
Ripping the hour of need
I am paranoid
The dark half of me a side I cannot see
Scars
I am
The dark
The bell tolls and I begin to wonder whyÃÂ 
It is the hour hand that prevails
My life lead by the speed of the minuteÃÂ 
As I watch seconds pass before me
And the hours of others trailing behindÃÂ 
To live free of it
I am without shelter
Without control
Defenseless
In both the world around me and in my head
The bell tolls and I begin to wonder whyÃÂ 
It is the hour hand that always prevails
Not until my lungs collapse will I be freeÃÂ 
To escape the confines of frailty
My legs unable to carry meÃÂ 
As the thoughts race through
My breath unable to stayÃÂ 
As I must face the sun alone
Not until my lungs collapse will I be freeÃÂ 
To escape this frailty that has confined me
ÃÂ 
I am without shelter
Without control
DefenselessÃÂ 
In both the world around me and in my head
Force feed people take their sight
They will never know
No resistance to our actions now
Nowhere for them to go
Open your eyes
They are not there
In time you'll realize
You'll thank me in the end
Silence carries our minds
Repress yourself become the fool
Repress yourself you wanted to
I give you the tools that you need
Ignorance is bliss
Obey
Force feed peopleÃÂ 
They are tame
They never bite the hand that feeds
Ever so content to stand in line
Originality is dead
We are your thoughts
In your head we are dormant
But where will thought get me
When those around me tell me what to be
An empty shell an inner hell
Waiting for deliverance
Open your eyes
They are not there
In time you'll realize
You'll thank me in the end
Contemplation of ones self
Epiphany of insignificance
Doubt
One of many no one listens
Imminent result of progress
Desensitizing process
Everyday life a standard of living
So this is progress
Cover up the strife
Become the prisoner
Become what you must
Contemplation of ones self
Epiphany of insignificance
Doubt your surroundings
To live life is to ÃÂ be told what to do
Accept
Become your role
Timid
All will remain
Nothing left to consider
No doubt to dwell upon
No feeling inside
Emotion gone
Desensitizing process
Internal monologues constant remembrance
How would it play out had restraint withheld me
Internal monologues constantly playing
Sleepless nights have begun to claim my judgment
Led me wayward from my conscience
Unknowing what is to come
Except for cryptic signs upon my awakening
Internal monologues
Judge me not for what I have done
But for what I know
Internal monologues constant remembrance
How would it play out had restraint withheld me
Internal monologues constantly playing
Sleepless nights have begun to claim my judgment
Panic state
Afraid to raise my eyes to the mirror
To my own judgment
Internal monologues
Judge me not for what I have done
But for what I know
Users are biased unable to accept the norm
They are the best nothing can be greater
Performance and quality superiorÃÂ 
Ability to sustain adequate lifeÃÂ 
A smooth exterior lead some astrayÃÂ 
Though these patrons know nothing
False let us prove
To you what is possible
Held by no restraintÃÂ 
We will now prevail
Assisted by the adversary
Unable to accept like a moaning child
Though we are without fear
Users are biased unable to accept the norm
They are the best nothing can be greater
Performance and quality superiorÃÂ 
An opportunity arises a change in pace
Your knowledgeable chance
In hopes to be proven
Though initial acceptance is short lived
Covered by denial
False your actions are always
We have proved the impossible and will again
Will no longer remain
For we will prevail on our own
Attempts to show in plain sightÃÂ 
Unbiased we will strive forth
Assisted by the adversary
See in the end we will be the ones laughing
An opportunity arises a change in pace
Your knowledgeable chance
In hopes to be proven
Though initial acceptance is short lived
Covered by
I saw his face
And a thought crushed my mind
No words exchanged
But a fear felt eternally
Like a plague
I am forever stricken
And like a child
I am safer without the thought of it
So take me from this darkness
Remember that I'm lost without you
From from the darkest of both worlds
I will follow you home
I saw his face
And a thought crushed my mind
No words exchangedÃÂ 
But a fear felt eternally
While home became
But a memory
I found myself
Safer without the thought of it
So take me from this darkness
Remember that I'm lost without you
From from the darkest of both worlds
I will follow you home
Imminent life ending wishes
Weapons of the human mind can still bring death
In this life a subtle thoughtÃÂ 
Could take your last breath
The vision rips into you
Torn feel the fear come off of you
You will never be reborn
In the end the only answer is dirt
It's where we all must go
Better from your own handsÃÂ 
Than an unseen fatal blow
Forces I can not escape
Struggling with the inevitable
Blindly secure my ÃÂ fate
Struggling with the inevitable
Imminent life ending wishes
Weapons of the human mind can still bring death
In this life a subtle thoughtÃÂ 
Could take your last breath
Now the end has begun for you too
You realize the master's power over you
With each day we trust in the same path
So if there's no God what can you believe
Forces I can not escape
Struggling with the inevitable
Blindly secure my ÃÂ fate
Struggling with the inevitable
Imminent life ending wishes
Weapons of the human mind can still bring death
In this life a subtle thoughtÃÂ 
Could take your last breath
ÃÂ 
Moments pass and I find myselfÃÂ 
Trailing further and further behind
Their faces I can never seeÃÂ 
Calling out to them
The names of those who d left long ago
Each step furtherÃÂ 
And another step behindÃÂ 
Down this thickening pathÃÂ 
With no end in sightÃÂ 
ÃÂ 
This promise of sleep lost long before the night
As I was told this would be my lastÃÂ 
Never forgotten what it means to live
ÃÂ 
Unfulfilled and out of reach
Like the faces I will never seeÃÂ 
And the names I will never know
With no end in sight
It was only a matter of time
Before the taps were leaked
The last breath of security is taken
And the mask is removed
It was this revealing moment
That would determine my fate
And the tracking would continue either way
A standard for good and too for evil
Brought me home to a bottle
But not enough was it to hide
As I am one to throw stones
Brought me home to a bottle
But not enough was it to hide
As I am one to throw stones
It was this revealing moment
That would determine my fate
And the tracking would continue either way
A standard for good and too for evil
Brought me home to a bottle
But not enough was it to hide
As I am one to throw stones
And when the spirit of these walls
That contain my life
Inch closer and closer together
I can hear my name as it's called
Not once do they turnÃÂ 
Their faces towards me
Their chins weighted to their chests
In fear of discovery
The room dark and quiet as I sat
Amongst the whisperers
A stale breeze steady beneath our noses
Fastened to each exchange
Thoughts of which I'd never thought be spoken
Holding my breath as I sink with them
Though it pains me to hear and not to breathe
My taste of fate kept behind my teeth
Not once do they turnÃÂ 
Their faces towards me
Their chins weighted to their chests
In fear of discovery
I reach to catch my breaths and tears
Not to disturb the design
Of a carefully calculated demise
Holding my breath as I sink with them
Though it pains me to hear and not to breathe
My taste of fate kept behind my teeth
We force the resistance on their knees
We feel no human compassion
We are the filth of the Third Reich
A fury of despised unleashed
For us no honour or monument
Just a headless corpse in a nameless grave
With bloodlust in our eyes
We murdered hundreds of wounded enemies
We bring death to Russia
We butcher Iwan on his knees
We feel no human compassion
We were told they are also the enemies of God
FÃÂÃÂ¼r uns kein Blut und Ehre
Hunted down by the army of the Red Star
And for the remembrance of your lovedones
A pyramid of human bones we erect
Beware the filth and the fury
A trail of bloodshed we hauled
We rape your women and murder your children
Wotan give us strength
Give us hearts of stone when we commit murder
We spit in the eye of the eagle
We point our hate to the cursed swastika
FÃÂÃÂ¼r uns kein Blut und Ehre
We are the filth of the Third Reich
A fury of despised unleashed
FÃÂÃÂ¼r uns kein Blut und Ehre
I turn my eyes to Dagon
Our great god
Flat on his divine face
In the Temple of Oannis
We feel no more glory about the battle of Aphek
What sacrifice is needed for victory
Enemies who speak in tongues of fire
Purify us in black flames
We burn oh god we burn
We bow down in shame and whisper powerless words
Let not the ark of the God of Israel be with us
for his hand is hard on us and on Dagon our god
This blasphemy will be avenged upon us
Our blood will colour the earth bloodred
And it will be licked away by the doggods
Darkness will be upon us for three horrible days
Pestilence and death creep over our land
Flocks of bugs will ruin our crops
Blistering flashes from the skies
Onslaught the enemies of Israel
We are the damned race
Cursed by the wrath of Yahweh
Our millennial resurrection
Shall be smothered in blood
I turn my eyes to Ba'al
Our great god
Powerlessly staring at the horizon
In the temple of Created Things
We feel no more glory about the battle of Afek
What sacrifice is needed for victory
Those who speak in tongues of distemper
Purify us in black flames
The firespitting demon Azazel
Spreads his blackened wings
The earth is drenched in the blood of Goliath
7 months of suffering
Lord Ba'al creator of our fertile earth
Majestic father and king of gods and men
Master of the mountains ruler of the rainstorms
We bow down before thy splendour
Lord Ba'alEl god of life and fertility
Intermit the continual combat with the god Mot
Show the leech of Yahweh thy might
And slay the Hebrews and their ravaging god
We bow down in shame and whisper powerless words
Let not the ark of the God of Israel be with us
for his hand is hard on us and on Dagon our god
Release us from the suffering
Before thine erected sacred altars we beg
We are smitten with divine abominations
Unshackle us from death and sterility
And destroy the realm of the circumcised
Scorching lungs the fallout funeral
buries deep the doomed workers
Feebly shoveling lead and sand
To quench 2000 degrees of fire
In this gargantuan tumour
The choice had already been made
Safety or Siberia
Positive void coefficient
Retraction of power rods inefficient
A flawed design in monstrous proportions
Blows the 1000tonne roof yards high
The Ukranian star burns bright in the sky
A thousand tons of steel and cement
Dispersed like a cancerous cough
Eager to hush it all up the denying Kremlin
Dispatches liquidators embalmed in radiation
Uncontrollable contamination
Glowing nuclear devestation
Magnificent no 4
Now melting uncontrollably
And the name of the star is called Wormwood
And the third part of the waters became wormwood
And many men died of the waters
Because they were made bitter
Revelation 81011
Red glory turns to green light
Apocalyptic fires blaze
Scorching lungs the fallout funeral
buries deep the doomed workers
Graphite evaporates
Oozing invisible death
Feebly shoveling lead and sand
To quench 2000 degrees of fire
Attending their fallout funeral
This monstrous colossus
Radiating cancer
for generations to come
20000 tonnes of steel and cement
Cover the tumourous spider
Awaiting her next victims
The Concrete Sarcophagus
Philip II was impopular but his only son
Yea we pull down the images of the false church
We pillage the temples of the popery
The Iconoclasm Fury broke out and idolatry burnt
The Iconoclasm Fury broke out and idolatry burnt
Yea we pull down the images of the false church
We pillage the temples of the popery
Risen from the seed of Enki
With consent of the Godfather Anu
We are the working race
Created in the temples of SCHRUPPAK
The Masters ride the midnight sky
In their lucent chariots of thunder
Those who behold the radiant face of the Gods
Died eyeless scorched and ablaze
And Godslaves we are
Suffering in the mines of our Masters
We populate the fields of EDIN
The base of the Gods from NibiruPhaÃÂÃÂ«ton
The days of Sodom are counted
To devour the mutinous creatures of Enki
Unwilling to bow for the Godfather Anu
The Lord was the blessed name they carried
Composed from the leeches of the Kosmos
The Gods must be slain
So mankind will be blessed with their wisdom
In the darkest depths of ABZU
With the vulpine Snake on our side
Ruler of the underworld of EDIN
We conspire against our Masters
After the dismantling of the alien Gods
We become divine
To whitewash the UmmaReich from the sons of Zion
Allah Akhbar
Beware of the Fourth Reich
It will come
Plodding on through the sucking grey mud
The carnage fought oozed by trench war clay
That in springs past sprung not a single bud
For fear of more death or total dismay
Though shells may plow clean the fields
Burning the crops and mauling the mud
The wind brings only death from a vat
Fertile by cold blood a young man yields
Innocent yet mangled in gruesome combat
Spewing blackest bile the gas claims one more
Cold death comes creeping through the trench
If not by shells maimed or crazied long before
A cloud of mustard takes half of those deployed
Ghastly faces peer back in black or hues of grey
The grandiose arrogance victory as agony intent
Lifeless by the commanders that them did betray
The mindrape of the spectacle of dehumanization
Ghostly faces peer through the veil of celluloid
Creeping like a snake from a can
The slithering stench of yellow death
Chemical flame of decay
Burning skin and intestine
Regurgitating the bloody guts
Spewing last life from a wretched soul
Live for life kill for all that is wrong
he drags himself to safety
Death in the Perimeter
Where furious endearment once was cradled
crippled by crossfire but firm of will
Live for life kill for all that is wrong
he drags himself to safety
Death in the Perimeter
The need to bleed to gain a yard of mud
Plodding on through the sucking grey mud
The carnage fought oozed by trench war clay
That in springs past sprung not a single bud
For fear of more death or total dismay
Burning holes in his battered back
Eyes and mind leaning on the fair horizon
but his heart drowning in trench war clay
Fertile by cold blood a young man yields
Shredded by barbed wire
screaming shrapnel incandescent hail
They expect us to die as harmless victims
Snow fills my lungs in this perpetual winter
It is november 1954 I pray for my own death
How can I prolong in this endless winter
As the enemies of the people
We perish in the goldmines of the cold North
Synonymous with the horrors of the Holocaust
With fear in our eyes we wisper the phrase
Kolyma means death
Sickness and cold bitterness and hunger
In this endless winter grief is never absent
Kolyma means death
We demand to the snowy mountain peaks
We shall remember the phrase
Kolyma means death
Die Partei die Partei die hat immer Recht
Und Genossen es bleibe dabei
Denn wer kÃÂÃÂ¤mpft fÃÂÃÂ¼r das Recht
Der hat immer recht
Gegen LÃÂÃÂ¼ge und Ausbeuterei
Wer das Leben beleidigt
Ist dumm oder schlecht
Wer die Menschheit verteidigt
Hat immer recht
So aus Leninschem Geist
WÃÂÃÂ¤chst von Stalin geschweiÃÂÃÂt
auch wenn ihr noch so oft versucht
Klar auch ich bin genervt
von der stÃÂÃÂ¤ndigen Gegen
und ÃÂÃÂberstellung
Auch ich bin genervt
aber gibt es eine Wahl
Oh die Stimmen sie sind laut
und ich weiÃÂÃÂ dass es falsch sein soll
von einem auf viele zu schlieÃÂÃÂen
Aber wÃÂÃÂ¤hret ihr nicht langsam mal
an der Reihe mich vom Gegenteil
zu ÃÂÃÂ¼berzeugen
Oh die Stimmen sie sind laut
und ich weiÃÂÃÂ dass es falsch sein soll
mich vom Gegenteil ÃÂÃÂ¼berzeugen zu lassen
Zu schlieÃÂÃÂen
an der Reihe
zu ÃÂÃÂ¼berzeugen
Zu schliessen
von einem
auf alle
Day after day after days
and week after weeks
youre caught in
those memories
ÃÂ«Damals als wir noch ÃÂ»
Ja wie oft musst ich das schon hÃÂÃÂ¶ren
Und was wurde daraus gemacht
Nichts und wieder nichts
Aber lieber mal damit zufrieden gegeben
immer noch sagen zu kÃÂÃÂ¶nnen
ÃÂ«Ja damals das waren gute ZeitenÃÂ»
Und leider bleibt es dabei
ihr habt die Uhren
und wir
wir haben die Zeit
Und leider bleibt es dabei
ihr habt die Uhren
und wir die Zeit
And months after months after months
years after years after years
youll be caught in those memories
instead of facing your fears
Und so wird auch
der Rest im Kopf
kleiner und kleiner
kleiner undÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ
BloÃÂÃÂ nichts zurÃÂÃÂ¼cklassen
das ist genau im Sinne dieser Zeit
Schneller schneller
mit allem verbunden und trotzdem allein
Tja wohl vergessen dass da doch einiges
auf der Strecke blieb
AuÃÂÃÂer der verpassten Freundschaften
auch wohl die Idee
Und so wird auch der Rest im Kopf
bestÃÂÃÂ¤ndig kleiner und kleiner
Umdrehen weitermachen Schnauze halten
Und so wird auch der Rest im Kopf
der ein mal frei fÃÂÃÂ¼r Gedanken war
kleiner und kleiner
bestÃÂÃÂ¤ndig kleiner und kleiner
Umdrehen weitermachen Schnauze halten
Umdrehen weitermachen Schnauze halten
Umdrehen weitermachen Schnauze halten
Trotz SchwarzWeiÃÂÃÂSehen
Rot vor Wut geworden
mit dem Kopf gegen die Wand
und nicht gesehen dass
daneben noch drei
Meter Platz waren
Who is in control
When your mind and troubled heart
seem to have lost it all
Is it your head you'll follow
Fast wie Schlafwandeln
Gefangener der Szenerie
Was hÃÂÃÂ¤lt mich noch
Alles nur eine
Frage von Millimetern
Nur SchwarzWeiÃÂÃÂSehen
Rot vor Wut geworden
mit dem Kopf gegen die Wand
und nicht gesehen dass
daneben doch zehn
Meter Platz waren
Who is in control
When your mind and troubled heart
seem to have lost it all
Is it your head you'll follow
So here I am asked myself once again
Who gives the air that I am breathing
Never took the easiest way
Never chose the easiest day
Couldn't find a cause to blame
Always got the cash to pay
Always found the games to play
Sometimes had a beast to tame
Why don't you hear my voice
Did you accept my choice
Your hope of life dried out
When I realised my aim
Hollowed be thy name
Had enough of confidence
Held the name of innocence
I ruled the land of pain
My law was insecure
My punishment for sure
Who played the masters game
I could not hear your voice
Never accept your choice
Your chance of life dried out
When I justify my aim
Hollowed be thy name
Cold were the days
Lost in your memory
Cold was reality
Cold were the days
After our souls had to realise two games
Hollowed be thy name
Remember the shadow race
Injustice and crime look over
Consider the mortal pace
That the evil brings
For money and heavens call
They're running through times and ages
Velocity came to law and leads to
Spped of life  the rush of time
Is part of the demon
Speed of life  the rush of time
The speed of life is devil's exercise
They're running the wicked race
They're playing with raging fire
No time for to rest and stay
That's what the master says
Hold on in a world of shame
Stay true to law and order
There's nothing that I can you blame
For the
Speed of life  the rush of time
Is part of the demon
Speed of life  the rush of time
The speed of life is devil's exercise
Escape from the rising sun
A light from the far horizon
Your choice is to hit and run to
Speed of life  the rush of time
Is part of the demon
Speed of life  the rush of time
Cause everything's part of the
Speed of life
He's searching for the truth of time
But does not find answers
Watch out high on the wire
The world seems like bugs on the ground
He's blinded by the light of fire
Goes deaf and dumb slightly
Look out
Hear the echoes of your past
See the mirror of your mask
Feel the hurt of endless pain
In the land of wind and rain
Behind the walls of time and space
You recognise your freedom
Look outhigh on the wire
You stand on the edge of the world
Hear the echoes of your past
See the mirror of your mask
Feel the hurt of endless pain
In the land of wind and rain
Hope one day we will find our home in space
Time after time we'll stay
To find the glory ways
Our path away
Home in space
One day
Our glory way
Hear the echoes of your past
See the mirror of your mask
Feel the hurt of endless pain
In the land of wind and rain
In a world of innocence
You gave me shelter from the tempest
In a tima of hope and joy
You always dedicated love to me
Burning bridges everywhere
And nobody to declare
House on fire burnt my soul
My desire is getting cold
House on fire in my head
Sick and tired
Twenty one is much too young
For a child without a warning
Poorest dream has come alive
When you died on a cloudy morning
Burning bridges everywhere
And nobody to declare
House on fire burnt my soul
My desire is getting cold
House on fire in my head
Sick and tired
In a world of innocence
When you died on a cloudy morning
Burning bridges everywhere
And nobody to declare
House on fire burnt my soul
My desire is getting cold
House on fire in my head
Sick and tired
Out of my head things are going mad
So we cannot return into life
Out of my mind all eyes are still blind
And the only impression is pale
We cannot realise the aim
Just did identify that
There's no one in ghost town
Nobody switched the light on
A black hole in ghost town
Just dark and cold rooms for to pray
Inside your bed the rats are still there
And the poison corroded the frame
Inside your mouth your tongue starts to shout
And it swallows the uncertain name
We do not realise the aim
No one did recognise that
There's no one in ghost town
Nobody switched the light on
A black hole in ghost town
Just dark and cold rooms for to pray
We cannot realise the aim
Just did identify that
There's no one in ghost town
Nobody switched the light on
A black hole in ghost town
Just dark and cold rooms for to pray
A black hole in ghost town
Just dark and cold rooms for to stay
And God saw that this work was nearly done
A blue mighty planet circled round the sun
And God saw that this work was nearly done
A blue mighty planet circled round the sun
And God saw that everything was nice
But there had to be a creature
who looked like me and you
So he realised
So he took some earth and put it in a form
But the oven wasn't hot enough
so the white man was born
You can live in the cold zone of the world
'Cause you are used to it since your birth
But one who's not so pale
He has to get a hotter blow
So he took some earth and put it in a form
But the oven was too hot now
so the black man was born
You can live in the hot zone of the world
'Cause you are used to it since your birth
But one who's not so dark
He has to get a special blow
So he took some earth and put it in a form
And the oven was right now
So the gipsy was born
Go to the top of the mountain and look
Do you see this land around
Go where you like to be
'Cause you and the gipsy will be free
Time  
Do you imagine our time
Do you find out what's always
Here in sight always there in light
Space 
Do you determine holes in space
The little black ones that you
Never see but always will be
Always will be in light
All above the atmosphere
Is reaching the sun
Take the flight without no fear
Get pleasure from light
Signs 
Can you discover holy signs
A little red one which is
Always here always in your mind
Place 
We all are searching for our place
The little quiet one
Where we rest our soul
Find our home
Leave our clothes to stay
All above the atmosphere
Is reaching the sun
Take the flight without no fear
Get pleasure from light
All above the atmosphere
Is reaching the sun
Take the flight without no fear
Get pleasure from light
Lord of the lamp will you offer your hand
Will you promise to light me the way
I followed the stars
And I searched for the right pass to go
Child of the sun
Can you now understand
What the prophets might tell you one day
The trail to the light is becoming the guide
Of your daydreams your life scenes
We are believers and we'll run the game
To bring out the sun
And the moon and the stars on their way
Lord of Madness turns out pain
Who's to blame
He goes nowhere out there
Lord of Madness cries out bitter tears
But nobody hears
Keeper of earth
Have you already heard
That your sadness is part of your days
Old King of the hill
Is there somebody still in your dark cave
Cold grave
We are believers and we'll run the game
To bring out the sun
And the moon and the stars on their way
Lord of Madness turns out pain
Who's to blame
He goes nowhere out there
Lord of Madness cries out bitter tears
But nobody hears
You got the key to unknown land
And tried to keep your helping hand
We found the complete way to go
Your spirit patched up broken wings
Your patience healed our wounded skins
You took your time to rescue life
Left things go right and black turns to white
We lived as we borrowed the time
Fire and ice and water was turned into wine
Has to find out the way of the world
Must have been a place to stay
Your memory shows all they earned
Some lessons that they had to learn
Knowledge of the unknown man
We lived as we borrowed the time
Fire and ice and water was turned into wine
As a child born
As a child born
I realised the pain of Savage Land
No one forgot Insurgeria
We lived as we borrowed the time
Fire and ice and water was turned into wine
Neterkua Apep
DejdHkna Akhkna
Into the Tuat our infection shall be planted
To grow and with disorder overthrow the old gods
Let Sekhmet bathe in blood with us
No gods before me I devour them
Apophis triumphs over Ra
Neterkua Apep
DejdHkna Akhkna
UnemSnef I am protean in shape and form
No pylon is sacred no deity untouchable
UnemSnef I am the apex of the souleaters
And nothing more that keeps its sense
fire looses its warmth and its light
The truth is lost behind a fence
cannot show what is wrong and what's right
Just silence stays forevermore
To be an only friendly guest
To be a keeper of the lore
Which can't be found in your quest
But dusk and void became alive
They call they pray they whisper to be heard
And ask to join them just to try
To turn into a songless bird
They ask they call they pray they force
To leave your grave under grey stone
To cross all borders break the doors
To understand that you are all alone
And say as she doth in the heavens move
And youu my thoughts that my mistrust do carry
If for mistrust my mistress do you blame
Say though you alter yet you do not vary
As she doth change and yet remain the same
If she for this with clouds do mask her eyes
And make the heavens dark with her disdain
With windy sights disperse them in the skies
Or with thy tears dissolve them into rain
The sky won't be blue again
The scent of meadows forever gone
Fading cries a colden reign
The magic land of sparkling snow
Enchanting beauty in its pride
A mystic stranger softest might
A sad and colden nameless bride
Never forgiving winter's night
Sky won't be blue again
The scent of meadows forever gone
Fading cries colden reign
The magic land of sparkling snow
Enchanting beauty in its pride
A mystic stranger softest might
A sad and nameless bride
Never forgiving winter's night
Unquiet thoughts your civil slaughter stint
And wrap your wrongs within a pensive heart
And you my tongue that makes my mouth a mint
And stamps my thoughts to coin them words by art
But what can stay my thoughts they may not start
Or put my tongue in duraance for to die
When as these the keys of mouth and heart
Open the lock where all my love doth lie
How shall I then gaze on my mistress eyes
My tongue would rust as in my mouth it lies
Cease to breathe my friend no moore
Please no longer live not now
Close your eyes forevermore
Stop your heartbeat sounds somehow
Tell me no farewell don't speak
I won't bury you don't ask
Choose your place in mystic dusk
Choose it on the highest peak
Cease to breathe my friend I'll leave
Leave your shadow leave your shape
Promise me we'll meet in grief
Silence nothing more to say
I will help you now just wait
I shall see you'll come to stars
Bring illusions there so far
Bring the death there don't be late
Praise blindness eyes for seeing is deceit
Break heart and bleed for there is no receipt
To purge inconstancy from most mens minds
And if thine ears false heralds to thy heart
Convey into thy head hopes to obtain
Then tell thy hear ring though art deaf by art
Now love is art that wanted to be plain
Now none is bold except they see his brains
Affection is not known until one be dead
Rewards for love are labours for his pains
Loves quiver made of gold his shafts of lead
Can she excuse my wrongs with Virue's cloak
Shall I call her good when she proves unkind
Are those clear fires which vanish to smoke
Must I praise the leaves where no fruit I find
No no where shadows do for bodies stand
Thou may'st be abuused thy sight be dim
Cold loves is like to words written on sand
Or to bublles wich on the waters swim
If she will yield to that which reason is
It is reaons's will that loveshould be just
Dear make me happy still by granting this
Or cut off deleays if that I die must
No where shadows for bodies stand
May'st be abuused sight be dim
Cold loves like to words written on sand
bubles wich on waters swim
She lived in darkness and in light
For pilgrims in the deepest night
For poets searching for the sign
But seen seen the sense only to die
She wasn't warm she was so cold
But granted warmth to every heart
Of those who were so brave and bold
To let themselves to be apart
She was to blame of every hope
Of those who're wandering in vain
Who found inhuman deadly cold
Discovering their own ways
She was the one she was the star
Or could be brightest saddest for eternity
But she was pale and not so far
To not fall down on Earth one day
Like George Orwells predictions in his '1984'
Maybe somewhat different but globally the same
Did it ever occur to you that Jehovahs are ok 
when they're compared to islamic pigs
supports some jobless obese bitch 
I accurse I defy your double standards
I cannot differ wrong and right
You assume and that's why those wicked bastards
implanted figments in your mind
It's just the way it is 
You think in holy concepts conditionally learnt
Impressed by lesser gods and merits never earned
Arousing you with money and phoney makebelieve
Some things must be faced yes even when it hurts
for in this land of milk  honey 
we're free in thought and speech 
Think first then behold view in perspective
Every item has very different sides
Evidently there are no truths or lies
It's just the way it is
I'm a nazi and a christian 
satanic and a heathen too
Reverted are the records I play 
when I've got nothing better to do
I wear my bomberjack 
if that's the way it's gotta be
I'll burn my country's flag 
it's all the same to me 
You fear the words like 'turks' or 'jew' 
can't call them 'faggots' or 'niggers' too
Why resist what is naturally divided
Should I be nice while I hate your guts 
What's wrong with women that are called a slut
I don't know maybe I'm too shortsighted 
Try to read my eyes 
'coz what's really in a name
Get rid of your frustrations 
find some minorities to blame
I'll use you as my target 
but that's something ya should take
A medal still has two sides 
so what difference does it make 
No I can't compare to you you are not like me
Gathered sisters hear my call 
United we stand divided we'll fall
Redemption has never been so near 
for who bear the mark of Venus
Sewingmachines and pans will melt 
into weaponry and chastitybelts
Man will face his darkest fears 
desecrate the Holy Penis 
Why why whytell me why darling
did you keep us down against our will
Dry dry dryyou bled us dry darling
Now you're the one to pay the bill 
It's time for female terror Amazonian onslaught
Your obstrusiveness and obsession with lust 
your blindfolded thoughts that makes me disgust
conceive my duty of giving birth 
My only right to work the dresser
Your system of roles surely burns to the ground
and evidently it turns the other way 'round
So keep in mind who wears the skirt 
stands above the things you treasure 
Lies Lies Liesno more lies darling
You'll beg for me and I'll be laughing
Cry cry cryprepare to die darling
I am the nail on your coffin
It's time for female terror Amazonian onslaught
Inverted crosses are their favourite toys 
and they make a fuckin' lot of noise 
I said purgatory should warm them up 
Somehow they never get amused
Burning churches gives them great PR 
Just leave these fools for what they are
Most Evil Kreeps  
Your horrid language merely makes me frown 
Please take away these dumb Norwegian clowns
Most Evil Kreeps
Terror and violence devastation on parole
The world gets more divided neonazi's reunite
Preparing new gas chambers to annihilate mankind
We are thrown back to the stoneage 
someone's planning a coup d'ÃÂÃÂtat
The journals are screaming horror 
but they can't do more than that
GI Joes in Cuba 
while out cities are in decay
Whales and tigers become extinct 
but we feel better everyday
Visions and dreams ideologies of hate
Take nothing for granted no room for debate
Mind your own business keep your own alley clean
I proclaim proudly I plan and I scheme
For scheming ploys money and money means power
Power grows money every minute and hour
So why should I coare whether doom is at hand
Perdition Suxx
What happened to honesty
What the hell's happened to truth
An adverse turn in leadership's ways
A negative procession delaying our truce
What's happening to the people
Or the body of politics
All for the crown just for an addiction
Money power they need a fix
Life's drastically changing with time
There were times when our worlds looked brighter
When we had thrived on the quotes
No false propositions no need for liars
Polished specimens to rule us all
An image to portray that fools majority
Ancient atmosphere do we recall
In which was worth trustworthy custody
Why ask what they are for
Facing their false selves
Denaturalizing leaders
Society's selfish meaning to confine
Disabled by the need to cure an insecurity
Masses strive to keep themselves in line
While the radical seek attention all the time
Say they're sick  just hypochondriacs
Cry some more I know it's all an act
Liestaken to extremes
Despisedbecause of what they need
A selfish thought to please themselves
Defying lying rebelling for attention
A disability taken from one extreme to another
Abusing rights defying given laws
Excessive whining they desire sympathy
Rebel they prove their lives are just a flaw
Immoderate acts plagued by the disease
Defeated fair and square at their own game
A cult or crew that know not of what to do
Indecisive life but who's to say
A life that's left them nowhere but to decay
A continental lifestyle thought to be
Has turned it's back on society
A life astray
Extensions of their thoughts to find their goals
Procrastinating life they can obey
No sense of direction but they're just people
A life that's left them nowhere but to decay
Deteriorated life swallowed whole
While choking on their own self esteem
In their quest for a dream
Searching for something  something to do
Their lives wasting away and passed them by
Before they know it their life's gone
They've met their fate a wasted life to die
Extensions of their thoughts to find their goals
Procrastinating life they can obey
No sense of direction but they're just people
A life that's left them nowhere but to decay
A continental lifestyle thought to be
Has turned it's back on society
A life astray
A prevalent personality
Susceptible to understand
Pressured with an easy procedure
Returned with a demand
You impatient wayward one
Can't deal with reality's harsh truth
You've been agitated by a supposed young fool
You just can't lose
Because you've been agitated
You turn to affliction in distress
A most important virtue you don't have
Living life only to regress
With all your arrogance
You ask for a favor and I refuse
You've been defamated by a young fool
With haughty views toward you
Unnecessary attitude
Agitating moods
Pressured with decisions
Applying affliction so profuse
Vain glory within yourself
A life that's meant to be an empty folio
Agitating affliction
Is the problem that you have
And you don't even know
You're minus one virtue
The virtue is patience can't you see
Useless retaliation is your fault
Administering affliction is how you feed
A prevalent personality
Susceptible to understand
Pressured with an easy procedure
Returned with a demand
You impatient wayward one
Can't deal with reality's harsh truth
You've been agitated by a supposed young fool
You just can't lose
You just can't lose
Imperfect design I am the
Creator in my own mind
Builder destroyer guardian of time
Holding on to a sense of purpose
Seeded deep within a castle stands 
Tools within my grasp built by my hands
Toss and turn adorn the altar 
This a place to exist but it's not my home
Material nature sweeps away the right
Uncommon creation burgeoning life
A sun sets on a unique singularity
In thoughts depth grey matter holds the key
Omnipotent presence commercialized
I architect inside these eyes 
Forced to feel what others feel
I'm just the number you idolize
Push in line to do the time 
Autonomous replicated lives
Pick their value from the crops
Stand the same and look inane
Replication of all mankind
Stand above the endless sea
Of mass produced identity
I am but one but I am none 
The soul anomaly
Our journey an evolution 
From matter to maker we are the conclusion
The writing's on the wall we bleed the truth
Built by broken hands and shattered belief
Replication of all mankind
I am but one but I am none
The soul anomaly
Failing to see direction in their eyes
The mind uncanny confusion pictures collide
Coalescence of vital falsities deny
To stop and see whats there to see
Guilt for the lesson learnt inside
Covered in white from head to toe
Hold tight to your fears and dont let go
Fates not here to show 
The path that leads the cowards chain
This empty conscience once burns bright
Grips destinys hand to be its guide
Now you see that karma favours the weak
A puzzle piece but one of many
Join us in the journey from obscurity
Yearn for the writing on the wall
Awaiting fates misguiding call
Yearn for the writing on the wall 
And wait for fates misguiding call
Destiny is not your guide
Set fire to themselves so their spark can ignite
Weary bones and broken seams
Wearing out the tattered causes
Point a finger in every face
A harrowing mirror of futility
Your value is high a precious commodity
For others to use and abuse with no sympathy
Mouths like voids swallowing all the light
Peel away the scab to which you fall
Flesh anew waits just below
Take heed to the sounding of the war drums
A battle to the end of all you know
Crumbling towers but time stands still
When visions intersect
Abuse the acceptance
Rousing desistance
Forever it takes as times hand slowly falls
In these remains we build
Like a phoenix down from the ashes
A drop of your resolution
In a concoction of conviction
Deliverance to the horizon
Paradoxical lost tomorrows
A drop of your resolution
In a concoction of conviction
Deliverance to the horizon
Paradoxical lost tomorrows
Its hard to see today in this pixelated age
Connection pending to the human race
Run to see your fifteen minutes fade
As we start to look the same
A diamond in the rough a null point intrusion
We race through a network of lies
Faces blurred between the lines
Made to believe we pull the strings
Puppets to this global reclusion
Reset the system create disorder
Disrupt the masses and watch them falter
We live a life
Unrelenting in its force
With good and bad
Born to feel
Our pain and suffering 
We can overcome
Our loss and grief 
We can hold on
A struggle conceived 
By callous thieves 
Your strength perceived 
A guilt relieved 
They can't take from you 
What they do not own
You control your fate
You claim the throne
There's nothing of them 
To frame as unknown 
Their weakness is visible
In all their tone
Youre free to choose
Youre free to live 
Let not your dreams 
Fall to these thieves
There's nothing you can't do 
You have what it takes 
To live your life through
With all its wakes
Attempted divination fearing what's to come
The needle's eye lies far beyond
Don't let my lies falter your aim
Of a light that burned out long ago
Construct the lie to fight for
When our beacons lead back to the start
Convictions fail we fall apart
Made to feel your hurt and just keep breathing
Beaten down and stripped in a glint of sadness
Well designed enabler of delusion
When our beacons lead back to the start
Convictions fail we still fall apart
Broken as the chapter ends lost in despair
Find solace as you turn the page
Ink that flows to another place
Made to feel your hurt and just keep breathing
Close the wound so deep and find youre bleeding
Out no more its just beginning
Imagine if time had truly stopped
When every minute feels like the end of time
And every breath takes everything
Look at the story told transcend the open page
Dig past this fortified state of mind
Stretching out to eternity
Built to break a sense of purpose as we fall
Or go hungry in this world of disarray
Remembering that nothing lasts forever
In this deforming state of consciousness
Were left to live whats left behind
Only dining on memories of the future
Bringing us the same defeat
Revel in oblivion discard your mortal shell
And embrace the end as life wears thin
Revel in oblivion
Now you paint your piece on the canvas
Revel in oblivion discard your mortal shell
And embrace the end as life wears thin
Revel in oblivion the darkness grows within
Embrace the cold as the lights go dim
Revel in oblivion
No one escapes
Lashed by wicked tongues
Words of salt to open wounds
My life was naught but pain
In death I have an escape
Im bound to the ferryman
With all my sins
You think you got away
You think you're clean
Your soul is stained
A coin to wipe your dream
The journey was long
But it's not over yet
The lonely man awaits my passage
The river calls Im lost to its charm
It calls for you like it called for me
Heed my words that left with me
Your breath runs short as mine did
Heed the warning written in the sky
Soon youll join me when you die
Kharon he calls to me
The lonely man he stands as host
Heed my words that left with me
Your breath runs short as mine did
Heed the warning written in the sky
Soon youll join me when you die
Forced into a place you dont know
Youve already died
This is the end of your time
Youve already died
Fading light the turn of time
Theres nothing left
Dead embrace
Follow the darkness
Stray from sight
And make the call
Your loving might
Fall to your knees
Praise us for we bring you to life
Praise us for we're your dying light
The candid decadence of man's proliferation
Existence is cyclical
Disgusting powers wield this place of horror
Tear off their clothes sting out their eyes
Spread their limbs for ritual slaughter
Hispanic blood floats down the walls
Here in the temple of horror
Doomed to slaughter sacrifice
Limps entangled in gore
Their hearts were shown to the sun
Fertile blood floats from the ritual stone
Spitting balls of iron 
Annihilation of civilization doom
I am Cortez I kill in the name of Rome
I slaughter in Gods name
I violently serve the heavens
We are the bloodsucking creatures of the night
Charging through pile the dead upon the dead
Endless straights of anonymous corpses
Sliding the skins off the unfortunate soldiers
Leaving them to rot in the impure winds of war
Stench from the purulent clays beneath 
Soil and flesh trampled to bloody snot
Trenches flooding with blood and gore
 Here is no peace here is no beauty
We are with one as we are with many
Thousands of throats cry for violence and death
Torched villages mark the theatre of the macabre
Black blood Frozen eyes feasting with the undead
Impaled like thousands of your despised people
Violently condemned to see your dying God above
We are the bloodsucking creatures of the night
Allah's war is lost today
Dark Seraphim Slayer of Jihad
Death in Carpathia the massacre is done
Face the flesh horizon destructor misantrophe
No Sultan no don't go away
No Sultan no your judge is just on its way
You shall die before the rising sun
I know there will be no light for me
My soul was baptised in the darkest depths
I serve the horns I proclaim blasphemy
I curse the face of God traitor
Ave ave Satanas
I curse the face of God traitor
Ave ave Satanas
I proclaim blasphemy
I doubt on my immortality
I am caught in the snares of death
I must die for my sacrilege
There shall be no dawn for me
Embrace the deadly kiss of the iron maiden
In the name of all that is holy
I clean their souls in flames
Traitor
On the fringes of the empire I will arrive
I serve the book of blood
The monster from darkness a murderer with joy
I am the plague of  the thousand burning cities
With lust I eat the flesh of my enemies
Slaying my enemies I delight in war
King of Huns terror of Rome
I am Attila known as the scourge of God
Slay the defeated chop off their heads
Of the parasites of the Great Hungarian Plain
We do not undeserve the reputation of cruelty
Devestating the city of Naissus
Gutters filled with blood
We are the mounted breath from hell
I am the one you fear
I pave your path to hell with the skulls of Rome
I curse the temple of Jupiter
I smash the face of Mars
Preparing for Jihad to obey their desert god
They murder for belief to deflower 70 virgins
The laws of the Sharia will not impress upon us
Your holy army blotted out pounded into sand
We desecrate the black stone
Slayer of Jihad
We do not obey their wretched desert God
We are impure
We are unrepentant your final blasphemers
We distort your image of God
The walls of Jericho will fall again
We root out the seeds of the Mudjahedeen
The golden dome shall return to sand
The laws of the Sharia will not impress upon us
Your holy army blotted out pounded into sand
The pest of Arabia shall not overwhelm us
In my dreams I go back to the forest of flesh
The sacred black stone the black seeds of Jihad
Impalement is delightful let us urinate on foes
Face the flesh horizon destructor misantrophe
We desecrate the black stone
Slayer of Jihad
Slaying the Wounded no prisoners we take
Counting the deaths and piss on their graves
The Meister of Krieg they pray for his death
The triumph from hell the symbol of death
Bow down your head and rip out your tongue
I murder like Manson when I cut out her womb
 I am the guardian of your brother
You damn sheep belong to others
Demonhordes have raped you mother
And burned the witch alive
I am drowning in desire
You create this global fire
Lord you are a goddamn lair
Let's hang the bastard Christ
Entangled in bloodlust entangled in gore
Slashed and naked she laid down on the floor
I copulate darkness and she will breathe no more
I am drowning in desire
You create this global fire
Lord you are a goddamn lair
Let's hang the bastard Christ
Slaying the Wounded no prisoners we take
Counting the deaths and piss on their graves
The Meister of Krieg they pray for his death
The triumph from hell the symbol of death
Crowd obsessed with blood and gore
Satisfied by the bloody spectacle
Witness the public funeral
In the ancient arena of death
Beast to men men to men beast to beast
For the praise of the Vestal Virgins
Prisoners fight each other to death
Kill them flog them burn them
Condemned to face a starved wild beast
When the wounded gladiator eats sand
Pass away in splendour
Steer away with Charon
Ave imperato morituri te salutant
To face the goddess Libitina
Hail emperor men soon to die salute thee
Gladiators in chariots dressed in purple
Obsessed with gore and slaughter
Condemned to face a starved wild beast
Romans obsessed with bloody battles and death
When the wounded gladiator eats sand
Gladiators in chariots dressed in purple
Obsessed with gore and slaughter
Ave imperato morituri te salutant
The persistance of flow
Took its place in his mind long ago
The next day will be the last again
Covering his lonely way  tell me since when
His friends call him freak
Behind his back they speak
About his strange behavior and his feat
In his world there is no place for a change
No escape just one way back to itself
Stay just where you are
Don't leave your wonted way
It's all you know and ever had
Trust in the machine
Running deep in your head
And guiding you  you cannot brake
And he still believes doing the right thing
Here's to him There's a price he cannot win
Easy to condemn what we don't understand
A land so far away to comprehend
Searching for a value unable to accept
We are not the ones who made this concept
Just a kind of open mind
Eye to eye hold on and try
Tasting his live
Try to survive
Do you think you're right
Another day alone
At a crowded place
He's staring at the mirror in his face
It's not about that he ignores his life
He's unable to comprehend he's still alive
Stay just where you are
Don't leave your wonted way
It's all you know and ever had
Trust in the machine
Running deep in your head
And guiding you  you cannot brake
And he still believes doing the right thing
Here's to him There's a price he cannot win
Stay just where you are
Don't leave your wonted way
It's all you know and ever had
Trust in the machine
Running deep in your head
And guiding you  you cannot brake
Hear the latest news spread over the land
Guided by the voice that keeps us under control
It's not the answer if you leave it all behind
On and on we leave ourselves and fade away
In between the broken clouds
Can you see you are not the only one
Close your eyes time to say goodbye
It's not the answer if you leave it all behind
On and on we leave ourselves and fade away
On and on we leave ourselves and fade away
Can you feel it somewhere deep inside
Sometimes dark and sometimes bright as light
Can you hear it speaking from within
Listen to your values and your sins
You know it's there a piece of the whole thing
Surrounding everything
Take a look at the starts so bright
Even gone sending us their light
Is all we need just trying to believe
Where do we go
Where did we come from
Does it make sense
What we're longing for
By following our dreams and fears
A secret deep inside in every one of us
Based on our beliefs is what we trust
The habits have prevailed over our wisdom
Did we just forget to listen
There will be a time
When it's calling you again
When you're falling to remain
Like an innocent child
Like a new appetite
To understand
The stars in the sky some million years old
Still keep on to shine even dead and gone
The only thing that cannot die on its way
Through space and time where souls find their
Home at the end of light
Make a choice in your mind
Follow your inner voice
They try to keep you blind
Time to make a choice
Don't let them take away your last hope and fate
You will finally make your own way
Looking up to the stars and start to realize
The day will come to join the light 
It's not a pain it is a prize
How many gods do we create to keep it strong
The end of light where the soul's at home
Why are we pleased to doubt as we fall
Where is the profit to query that all
One day you stop to glance at the point
Where we belong to the last joint
Baseless we fear what we're actually longing for
Crossing the path that fate has elected
Follow the steps to the end you've selected
Nothing to fear You're leaving the night
Take the last journey to the end of light
All my thoughts are spinning just around
I think of every time I am
Getting close and losing you again 
Sometimes so near too far away the next day
Is this all about and all I care for
This I want you to know
All I ever wanted all I need
I can find anywhere in you
All I ever trusted in all I need
Is getting close to heaven
Every time I can be with you
Just to feel to be in love with you
Is worth the game every day I play
Every time I'm sharing with you
don't say goodbye before we try
Tell me is this all about and all I care for
This I want you to know
All I ever wanted all I need
I can find anywhere in you
All I ever trusted in and all I really need
All I ever wanted all I need
I can find anywhere in you
All I ever trusted in all I need
Is getting close to heaven
Every time with you
All I ever wanted all I need
Is getting close to heaven
Every time with you
I can never let you know
Darkness comes tonight blinding your mind
Day by day you try to find a way home again
You are so alone You never stay
Wading through nightmare you never leave 
They tell you the sense of life
Searching for the gate  try to escape
A silent cry  no one can hear you now
Imprisoned in your world of lies
Turn out your mind
Hold on and stay
Just keep in mind you are never alone
Turn out your mind
Don't be afraid
There could be something leading you home
Just take my hands you can learn to live
And you feel like you're coming home
There is something more
So near and far away
With open eyes but blind
Where do you belong
In what do you believe
Who do you think you are
As long as you don't free your mind
You'll be enslaved inside your silent maze
Just take my hands you can learn to live
And you feel like you're coming home
You and I  distinct but such alike
You and I  frontiers we cannot hide
How could we ever forget all once we took care
Watch the instant passes by
Just before you realize
What we've learned to love
Is going to be compromised
There's nothing to eternalise
And nothing to remain
An unaffected habit
Turns into another blame
No one can stop the killing machine
That keeps us somehow alive
Centuries are gone time marches on 
Among them we keep up to flow
We're falling into never land
And losing our confidence
In what we used to believe
Missing sympathy
Weakling harmony
Now it's time to face a new outset
Once we did not understand
To hold on their traditions
Time has faced us to play this role 
The following position
No one can stop the killing machine
That keeps us somehow alive
Centuries are gone time marches on 
Among them we keep up to flow
But it feels like losing a friend
Like to betray myself
Now I wish to turn back time
And wake up in my dreams I can't forget
Ca I still ignore can I still be sure
Of what I am still holding on
What is deep inside to explain so tight
I will never feel again
Still nothing to eternalise
But so much to remain
Keep an eye on and realize
They only tried the same
No one can stop the killing machine
That keeps us somehow alive
Centuries are gone time marches on 
Among them we keep up to flow
Now I flow
Can you find yourself and tell me what you feel
Can you justify all you've done for me
Try another step
Trust in what you felt forever
Leave the past behind again
Swimming in the stream of time
Don't you see there's so much more
We cannot hear and cannot see
More than we can comprehend
Where do we belong
Where are we going to
What else can we find if we ever try
Somehow we understand
We can not turn away
Even though we try to ignore the truth
There's more than we can hear
There's more than we can see
There's more than we can comprehend for now
You say you know
Sometimes we try
To find another reason why
Wading through the Promised Land
Don't you see there's so much more
We cannot hear and cannot see
More than we can comprehend
Where do we belong
Where are we going to
What can we find if we try
More than we can hear
More than we can see
More than we can comprehend
All we can see
All we can list to
Just like a weird dream we can't escape
I think we are too much afraid of
To realize it's not too late
Even if the path we have to go is full of pain
Recall your memories
Through space and time
All you need is trust
To hit the road and leave the past behind
Watch out for your faith
Waits to be found
All you seem to know
Is based on an infected ground
It's so easy to believe what we have learned
Building up a bridge of hope between you and me
We breath the same air and feel the same sun
Touch the ground to find the basics we have lost
Living the madness we take it for real
to change anything you want
to stand up and face them all
to understand
Everyone is too afraid to leave behind
In what we trust to find something new
We've never been before outside of our dreams
What if it's surrounded us forever
somewhere in your hand
to change anything you want
to stand up and face them all
to understand
Everyone is too afraid to leave behind
In what we trust to find something new
We've never been before outside of our dreams
What if it's surrounded us forever
On and on I can hear them call
To comply all the dreams they've never met
Obviously they don't care at all
I can't retract a life that they've never had
My life belongs to me
So open up your eyes to see
I'm fed up with to meet your expectations
And I pay no attention to your ideals
Don't try to grasp
'cause you don't know me
I don't believe you can realize
Or understand I have my own needs at last
It's overdue to day goodbye to your lies
This is my way It doesn't lead to your past
Don't tell me what is right
Don't tell me what I have to do
I'm fed up with to meet your expectations
And I pay no attention to your ideals
Don't try to grasp
'cause you don't know me
All I want is that you promise
To respect this is my own life
It's time to let me go
One day we look back and realize
That our minds did not diverge too much
One day I understand that's the prize
That is the main point always to keep in touch
I can fly if I want
I can head for the sun
I can reach for all the stars out there
I can live on my own
I can find my home
I can do just anything
I'm fed up with to meet your expectations
And I pay no attention to your ideals
Don't try to grasp
'cause you don't know me
He always runs while others walk
He acts while other men just talk
He looks at this world and wants it all
So he strikes like thunderball
He knows the meaning of success
His needs are more so he gives less
They call him the winner who takes all
And he strikes like thunderball
Any woman he wants hell get
He will break any heart without regret
His days of asking are all gone
His fight goes on and on and on
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all
So he strikes like thunderball
All behold the spectacle
A fleshy limbless rectangle
Sitting on a pedestal
So nasal handicapable
Sniff and remember silver ball
Contortions that he can't recall
The torso on a trampoline
The happiness melts into dream
To talk is an enunciated sneeze
To taste is some foul air to breathe
He's a bird in flight a hermaphrodite
And he fucks himself as he fucks the world
His twitching brain can dance within
Gyrating more like gelatin
A secret means of ecstasy
Acute and very olfactory
To see is colors crawling in the nose
To hear is stinking highs and lows
Cuz he's Hitler  Swayze  Trump  Travolta
Smell Sweat Movement
Everyone's dancing
Disco
Dimple
Fading Darker
A subtle fragrance
Faint
Everyone's dancing without him
Where did it go
Dark
Odorless
You're the right one baby
You're the right one baby
And who keeps us pumping
As the world keeps dumping down
We are the only ones
Put the earth in the crook of your arm now
I have something more cosmic in mind
And who keeps us pumping
As the world keeps dumping down
We are the only ones
Oh yeah
Yeah we are the only ones
What can I say
What can I say
What can I say
What can I say
We are all here my friend
All dogged all spaced but all so beautiful
We burn that mountain down
And always pump for peace when possible
We bite ourselves and bite our dogs
And stretch the flesh unmovable
We are all here my friends
Alive and spaced but all so beautiful
We are all here my friends
All dead and spaced but all so beautiful
We burn that mountain down
And always pump for peace when possible
We bite ourselves and bite our dogs
And stretch the flesh unmovable
We are all here my friends
Alive and spaced but all so beautiful
Saw your face last night on the tube
Strong fine snake in a sucker's vacuum
15 clicks and it's time to say bye
15 trips and a love that won't die
Me and myself killed a world today
Me and myself got a world to save
Broadcast dead revolution don't pay
Strapped up freaks on the Lazarus plane
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
Yeah yeah yeah wow
Oh baby I'm lazy
Oh baby introduce me to God
Oh baby I'm lazy
Oh baby set a place for the dog for the dog
Yeah Oh
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
I will deny you
I will deny you baby
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah wow
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Going down now
The mountain screamed three times today
I guess it thought it'd like to play
How much does one have to pay
To fry a peak and melt away
Launching titan's breath on mine
The sweating measure lands on time
And the old man down by the river
Well he walks up and he walks on down
To the spaceship that's parked at your doorstep
And it's waiting to take you away now
Goin' down now
Goin' down now
Looking for the rate that crowed
He's hooked up down in Mexico
Slap my nerve now give me more
It's my disaster friend not yours
And the old man down by the river
Well he walks up and he walks on down
To the spaceship that's parked at your doorstep
And it's waiting to take you away now
And the last one it's down by the river
Where he gets up and he walks on down
To the spaceship that's parked at your doorstep
And it's waiting to take you away now
It's down by the river it's always this way now
It's down by the river it's always this way now
Going down now
Going down now
now now now
down down down
Enter now the lions den
It's long past due that we begin
I have longed for you afar
Love sacriface in my backyard
I have seen beyond my gaze
I have gazed beyond today
And their lust shall build a world
Is what the prophets have to say
In this world where I am king
The atoms roar and strange love sings
All the jewels that one can bring
Mutant rags and big TV
Service now the mushroom boy
Come to me now by my side
And if you don't want to play
Then I'm afraid you'll have to cry
'Cause I can fry you with my eyes
I can blow you to kingdom come
I can take all the friends away
I've got mushroom clouds in my hands
And a place in my head for you
Better come to the throne today
There's a line inside my head
I dance at night before bed
But I never took the ride
And silo shed on the other side
Service now the mushroom boy
Or at lest come to a show
Just one lick upon my thoughts
Or both our worlds will have to go
'Cause I can fry you with my eyes
I can blow you to kingdom come
I can take all the friends away
I've got mushroom clouds in my hands
And a place in my head for you
Better come to the throne today
Whoa
I'm just not quite right today
Whoa
I talk to planets baby
When you said alright
I thought you meant alright
When you said that's fine
I thought you meant that's fine
I guess some standards don't always apply
When the kid goes home
He always goes alone
He hides in the machine
And always stays fourteen
Well there's really nothing wrong with the plan
He goes to sleep at night and holds his own hand
It's inconceivable there could be an end
Who brings you back when you're gone gone gone
Who keeps alive the concept of mom
Who cares to care when they're really scared
When you're really scared
When you said alright
I thought you meant alright
When you said that's fine
I thought you meant that's fine
Well there is the answer on the tip of my tongue
There's the bubble on the face of the moon
There's a chamber that should always be full
Who brings you back when you're gone gone gone
Who keeps alive the concept of mom
Who cares to care when they're really scared
When they're really scared
Who brings you back when you're gone gone gone
Who keeps alive the concept of mom
Who cares to care when they're really scared
When they're really scared
When they're really scared
Sometimes I think this pig will just explode
Sometimes I hope this torture just goes on
Well I'll stuff myself in a pi of darkness
And I'll slam 'till I can't see home
Sometimes I think this pig will just explode
Sometimes I hope this torture just goes on
Well I'll stuff myself in a pi of darkness
And I'll slam 'till I can't see home
Dropping off the edge of nowhere
Everything I've ever known
This is what you asked for
Now this is what you'll get
Sometimes I think this pig will just explode
Sometimes I hope this torture just goes on
Well I'll stuff myself in a pi of darkness
And I'll slam 'till I can't see home
Dropping off the edge of nowhere
Everything I've ever known
I've ever known
I've ever known
I've ever known
Maybe I'll try something else
Squeeze the back of my head now babe
Say the words just right
Slide the praise of the pneumatic monkey
Like your mom last night
You're in agada da vida honey
Take a bit of the cow
We can piss on a fake revolution
God is telling me how
I can read all the lines on your face
I can breathe all the cancer in space
I can love all the worms of your hate
I can live live in the void I know I control
I control I control
Get a title of your own motherfuckers
Try to think on your own
The truth is hard to see brothers and sisters
When kings shake at their thrones
I could swear I was here last night
I could swear that I'm just all right
I can fly I can get so tight
I can drown drown in the void I know I control
I control I control
Fly fly fly
You can rape the world and be creative now
You can kiss the right side of your brain
Oh they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan king of Mars
Oh they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan king of Mars
All the blazing suns
Suck up all the gods and punks
It's enough to change your life
And you know I love to come
I can see beyond your dreams
I can see on TV
Keep it all for me babe all forever
You can rape the world and be creative now
You can kiss the right side of your brain
Oh they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan king of Mars
Oh they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan king of Mars
You can rape the world and be creative now
You can kiss the right side of your brain
Oh they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan king of Mars
Oh they can tell the tarot for the rest of us
And I can crown me Tarzan king of Mars
Yeah
I crept up on my baby I laid down on my town
And I'm never gonna tell you why
And I'm never gonna tell you why
Sometimes my soul just moves so slow
Like a dream of diesel heart that just won't go
There's a light that used to shine
I breathed it all the time
Now I wait on the edge of Mars
But it just don't show yeah
I'll see you around babe
I'll see you around babe
I'll see you around babe
I'll see you around babe
So long here babe
So long here babe
So long here babe
So long here babe yea
Babe yea
Babe yea
Babe yea
Babe yea
Babe yea
I'll see you around babe
I'll see you around babe
I can have my cherries and you can have you real
We were born in oil a million years ago
Makes us go makes us go makes us go
When I spoke with Saturn he told me I was gone
little monkey he lives inside my head
In your bed in your bed in your bed
I can smell invasion red excited mind
I can see a general dropping into flaming pines
We just plugged forever we just saved the day
Kiss your little self for me everything's ok
It's ok it's ok it's ok
Aaaah
Onto the head of a pin
Something relieves the pressure
And the cycle begins
All the ladies run to the barstools
Anticipation grows
Mother nature adds the ingredients
The women sip it slow 
One day God had to get off his ass
To this glass he had to pour his own booze
For this his woman had to pay the dues
Now all women must pay this terrible bill
That arrives every month against their will
A crescent hang over halfirritated smirk
Full migraine cramps and Maxipads don't work 
Have another round now
Complete the recipe
All your pain and anger
Wash into a crimson sea
He who filled your ocean
Sinks not but bobs afloat
Your sweet menstruation 
Will capsize his boat 
Don't you think it's scary
Life's a Bloody Mary
Blood and alcohol
Makes you think that nothing's wrong
Howling at the moon
When the wolf bane blooms
Raise your glass and toast
To the thing that hurts you most
Drink hard drink deep 
When life comes down to a sharp point
Onto the head of a pin
Something relieves the pressure
And the cycle begins
All the ladies run to the barstools
Anticipation grows
Mother nature adds the ingredients
The women sip it slow 
Concentrated into a liquid state
Released out of a spigot the tampon awaits
Flowing out of the nozzle and into your cup
Although you've had too much it's bottoms up
Every woman's got a secret with Mother Sun
We'll drink till dawn and we'll reminisce
And we'll bleed for each other with no remiss 
Have another round now
Complete the recipe
All your pain and anger
Wash into a crimson sea
He who filled your ocean
Sinks not but bobs afloat
Your sweet menstruation 
Will capsize his boat 
Don't you think it's scary
Life's a Bloody Mary
Blood and alcohol
Makes you think that nothing's wrong
Howling at the moon
When the wolf bane blooms
Raise your glass and toast
To the thing that hurts you most
Drink hard drink deep 
Excuse me bartender fill it to the rim
And fetch me a sanitary napkin
To wipe off what's dribblin' down my chin
Every girl washes out the month's bad times
By flushing her cares out into her panty liners
Tabasco sauce stings the memories
No release 
Dreadfully eternal
The stain of tomato juice
Never understand why
Your crotch is singin' the blues
Stirring up emotion
With a celery stick
Sickening combination
Your blender loves to mix

Rotting from the inside
Overincubated by the heat of fear and love
The self's coagulated 
Egg 
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la 
Boiling hard in euphemism
Slowly becoming part of the water
Like a frog who never knows
The jacuzzi's getting hotter 
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la 
How'd you know I was looking at you
If you weren't looking at me 
A stagnant pale perfume
Conceived to block the pores
The clotting glands encroach
The endless comfort of a mom
Deep inside my tanning salon
Wishing life was poached 
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la 
I can't seem to differentiate
I just want to fertilize you 
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la 
The cracks finally appear
Release cholesterol tears
The flooded cyst drains itself of pus
The lonely stomach chills unless it's drunk
So as she drives she'll close her eyes
Feel it warming up inside 
Rotting from the inside
Overincubated by the heat of fear and love
The self's coagulated 
Egg 
Oh an egg comes out of a chicken
Oh a chicken comes out of an egg 
There's no place like home
Drowning in your eyes the brown pools overflow
I'm talkin' to myself thinking that you are here
Blood freezes in my veins with your frigid touch
You're so beautiful you scare me to death
Unfolding mystery
You give me the goosebumps
You send shivers up and down my spine
You give me the goosebumps
You make me quiver and stumble my mind
You give me the goosebumps
My knees weaken when I look in your eyes
You give me the goosebumps
For my love I can find no disguise 
Infinity is killing me and you where we belong 
A tear falls from my eyes love chokes in a slur 
Unfolding mystery
Your magnetism pulls me closer and closer 
You give me the goosebumps
You send shivers up and down my spine
You give me the goosebumps
You make me quiver and stumble my mind
You give me the goosebumps
My knees weaken when I look in your eyes
You give me the goosebumps
For my love I can find no disguise
Old age wisdom and the world grown bald
And I wonder if repetition makes one forget
You're not really old 
Tantrums reveal that rich experience
Then you serve a dish I try hard to avoid
Finding worth in the worthless
Time spent learning to regress 
I listen try to care say mmhmm here and there
But there's something else inside
I try to be polite make you feel all right
I can be anything you like
I'll be a virgin forever 
Cataracts  everyone's the same old blur
But I'll make believe trying to cooperate
Awake nervous knowing that we'll meet
Force a circle into a square dance
Insist the future try and relive the past 
I listen try to care say mmhmm here and there
But there's something else inside
I try to be polite make you feel all right
I can be anything you like
I'll be a virgin forever 
I don't wanna dance na na na
A carnival for the human race
Cotton candy happy face
A child talking with his mouth full
Girlfriend gets stuffed animal

If you want to know what's behind the show
You ride my carousel and enter life's jail cell
The clown that painted a smile on you
Is now the one unmasking you
Animated scenes unwind
Dormant figures come to life 
Entangled in your own web
A twisted tunnel overhead
A glimpse of light a drop of dew
You slide into the swimming pool

You'll find that creature
At the bottom of the deep down
Susquehanna river
This one I had stood right on up to me
Tore out his hook and declared himself a prodigy
This one I had it looked bright like a sun
But oh no fishing ain't what it used to be
One little nibble in thirteen years
I really pack 'em in
This one I had I seen it in dreams
All shacked up with lightning and horizon beams
Well I bring 'em on up and then I pack 'em on in
In all the places I've been
And I swear it's never been like this before
Least not since 19 and 44
But today I made a sick discovery
Lead box in sassafras cove
Now I'm really cashing in
I have discovered the body of john Wilkes booth
Yes it's true I have Mr Booth

Oh I Tell You I Was A Wretched Sight
But I Stood Long And Hard Until The Light
Rubbing Needles In My Eyes Eating Dirt
I Stood Up And Everything Was AllRight
It keeps raining in my heart
And I begin to tear apart
As my tear drops on the floor
I know I'm lost forever more
Silence pounding in my head
But I can hear you scream instead
Still I feel like I can't breathe
It's the air smothering me
Where have you gone
What has turned out so wrong
Don't run away from me
Did you turn around to see me
Hold my spirit in your hands
So my heart can break in silence
You're here but in reality
You're far away from me
The dark has overcome
There's no home no where to run
Fallen angels sinking deep on my chest
I still can't breathe
The world is so colourful
But I am black and white
The sun reflects in my eyes
And grief is grief is the light
Dreams shattered hearts broken
And words that remain unspoken
I can speak just through my eyes
Every tear's a thousand lies
Where have you gone
What has turned out so wrong
Don't run away from me
Did you turn around to see me
Hold my spirit in your hands
So my heart can break in silence
You're here but in reality
You run you run away from me
She is so beautiful  it hurts my eyes
Looks like an angel  in disguise
Hides her feelings  away from my eyes
No on shall see her  when she cries
And she cries she cries
Beauty in black 
why can't you tell me
what's wrong with you
What kind of horror
you have gone through
Put down that mask
that hides your pain from me
I'm not afraid to see
beauty in black
On her way back home 
she walked through the dark
there were no others 
as she reached the park
it wasn't her own fault 
it was her fate
No one could help her 
it was too late
Searching for a holding hand 
for the open door
Warmth is what she's longing for 
got no trust no more
She was humiliated 
treated like a whore
Her life won't be the same 
as it was before
I'M not afraid to see to see  to see
I'm not afraid
Fourty nights and fourty days 
I've been waiting for this hour
That I meet you at this place 
and deprive you of your power
I know that you've been enchanted 
since the day that we first met
Finally destiny's granted 
us this night we won't forget
Can you feel me when I take your breath away
Angels calling cause they want to hear you pray
I can hear the angels of love
I feel near the heavens above
I will cast my spell on you
Time stands still the air heated well
wine and candles spread out their smell
on you I will cast my spell
At midnight earth and heaven unite
raising lust to infinite might
The stars came out tonight
never I've seen them shining
the stars came out tonight
never I've seen them shining so bright
You've been with me in my dreams
invited me to paradise
Dinner's boiling and it seems
you have composed it with your spice
Our skin so hot salt's in between
dessert takes place one floor above
In the dark I'll play your queen
we won't forget this night of love
I'm drawing pictures in the air
And I breathe like I never did before
I see the sun I stop and stare
I can't go back now
Now that you opened the door
Be careful you caught a falling soul
Let the sun shine
Keep my heart alive
It's bleeding in your hands
It's bleeding in your hands
In your hands oh
In your hands
I close my eyes to see your face again
I can't reach you where have you gone
I feel the sun get up and run
To have you once again
So I can feel alive
Sometimes I hyperact
At least behaviours indicate
That something's not intact
Concerning habits that relate
To lack of understanding
It doesn't matter for your part
But I still try to handle
My surplus energy  that's hard
I'm watching your movements
It appears so strange to me
All actions  slow motion
These images I see
Maybe I'm more than acting hyperly
I am surrounded by a floppy lethargy
Organizing facts
Order nice in fact
All I make
Speed of dream is low
Not until I know
That I'm awake
Try to pass my time
Try another rhyme
Pencils brake
Hard to hold a move
I can never prove
What it takes
Puddle in my mind
In another kind
A bigger lake
Reorganizing facts
Reorderd nice in fact
Speed up to my dimension
All of my tomorrows
Are too bad to be true
Like a dose of poison
I consider killing you
I take myself away
In the shadow of disgrace
I'm faced by something
That jumps around me
While I'm waiting
and dissipating
I never knew what's  like
Talking to myself
Unknown there is  one
Devoted to me
To be delivered from me
You've been waiting for such a long time
Taking control of my soul
Everytime I'm driving insane
I lay beneath the upcoming scene
It's happening once in a while
I'd take the train but I don't care
I'm watching my past passing by
Waiting for you to come
To take me over
Can't escape your sphere
Recommended Suicide
Received a package with a bestial grunt
Between two flattened streets patrolled by
Thoughts
A mechanical taste in my mouth
Seems to be my last demand
My words walk in the groove
Hacking through my bleeding heart
Although my lips they moved your voice
With teutonic freeze into the deep
And the silence I observe
Says it's worth a little pain
No matter where no matter how
The silence I observe it's worth the pain
The silence I observe my bleeding heart
The silence I observe
I thought you were alive
You're no use to anyone
The moment you arrive
All the deeds are done
I'm heading for a break
Laughter from the ground
I'm down in deepest freeze
I'd feel like fever now
When something goes reverse
It makes me want to puke
Before scratching my back
What was I thinking of
I thought I was you
I thought I could spend my life
For a break
From the ground
In deepest freeze
I'd feel like fever now
I go reverse
I want to puke
I scratch my back
I'd feel like fever now
I feel like fire now
What time did you see it happen
One face in a purple frame
Your crime is your radiant passion
A black border around the name
Thin blue line red light flashing
the silent rules of a lonesome game
I had to get away
I checked it more than once
I see the light
You'll never reach
It turns my mind
Until the day I die
These are the days of my life
Join me the dead shall arise
I perished alone
By the garden of sorrows
In the vale of tears
By the sick deep under
I hear you see
The works of wisdom in my ears
I know the way
to a higher state of mind
beyond the realms of light
I'm squealing for oblivion
I'm dressed in white
May I overcome
I've seen the light
You'll never reach
It turned my mind
Until the day I died
How do I feel I can't explain
I never knew what's going on
In my mind there's a voice
That's telling me the meaning of life
The heat makes me sick I gotta stay
I check the pain that can't be found
Theres comes the moment that never lasts
I fasten my seatbelts but I don't care
I am the one to blame
I'm like an endless pain
But the truth beyond it says
Better pull yuurself apart
To point the way outside
I can't stand it no more
Into the mirror I stand and stare
And like I figure there's no one there
The sound of daylight
It's getting me nowhere
The smell of dreamtime
Has got a different flair
I see the light out of you
I see the day coming in
When I know it is true
I ain't walking away
How many times can I be
The face within your dream
I don't care what I see
I'll be there if you scream
I swear you lost your life
It comes disguised as blue rays
The way you stare outat me
Makes me heartbeat decrease
I'm stuck in something I'll never be free
I can't move someone please help me
I drove a million miles
all the rooms were grey
I don't want to be nice
I think it's clever to swear
I wouldn't seek your advice
But I would look
I told you not to be so cute
Around the block
What can I do but be impressed
Against the clock
Raindrops fall
Wind blows through the dripping colours
I'm waiting for
getting dropped with all the others
Thought I could stay
A little while in that surrounding
I wished that may
Came back again and sun would bound in
Fuzzy shades of shadows all around
A veil of mist is covering the ground
Seasons run
Soon I grew old
Time has come
I'm loosing hold
Could this be all
Entire life
From spring to fall
A dark and murkygloominess is caused
By heavy smoke made by a cars's exhaust
I'm falling now
Think back to then when I was green
Bed myself down
And fade away in golden gleam
Raindrops fall
Wind blows through the dripping colours
Even if I act sometimes
like a split personality
I am obsessed by you
Like a polypeptide of someone elses
Mind but I know I'd better sleep
Sleep into a land where I find
The stairway to my personal void
My possession enthused a sudden voice
In a vain attempt
I leave you with this thought
Nothing isn't anything but it's
Tasteless and it's flat
nothing if  it's anything it is
Even less than that
I look around while something's in my head
Like a ton of lard
Like a death at a birthday party
I've got to spoil the fun
I don't want to bleed in vain
In a painful freeze
With a heartdisease called love
By the frozen trees
Feedback screams on a twisted riff
I've got more than I could spare
The perfumed dream of  a midnight shift
With my tongue hanging loose
Where can I park my horse
Down under in my head
I give a shit and sleep alone
Too much talking  ain't no good
Where can I park my horse
Running down with my brain opened wide
I push it hard 'till there ain't no  more
Take no advice that keeps me back
The bang bang bang of funeral bells
Where can I park my horse
Rebel rebel I never go home
I know what gets me wet
Wave on wave of body heat
Where can I park my horse
Is it me or could it be you
If it's not you it has to be me
Gimme a dollar and you see what I do
My name's John Wayne and I live on the sea
Here comes the blue
A million tears gonna tear apart
What never shuts
A million spears gonna pierce your heart
A thousand cuts
A million souls all running scared
All driven nuts
Over the moon back to my place
Off the ground to the lunar base
If I could have just one more wish
It would be a viscious fish]
I'll sink this fucking ship
We ain't stopping now
These chains will bring us close
Walking against the wind
Means that you'll value the simple things
No breaking away
This life I'm living
Is only the beginning of the end
Don't you know
How much can I stand and fight
It's on my mind
I'll leave no friend behind
I'll leave no friend behind
These chains will bring us close
Until the end
So don't come asking for
Don't come asking for redemption
'Cause you know that will never come
Now point your fingers up to the sky
The sky
Out of sight is out of heart
Memories will stay
In the end of the day we all feel repent
We all feel repent
Do you feel loveless
This ain't a life for fucking boy scouts
Fucking boy scouts
Forsaken words forget this place
This ain't a life for fucking boy scouts
Fucking boy scouts
Do you feel loveless
Yeah I hope you fucking do
If it don't feel the same
The same
Maybe that's why you never felt it
Never felt it
If it don't feel the same
Maybe that's why you never felt it
Never felt it
These chains will bring us close
Until the end
So don't come asking for
Don't come asking for redemption
'Cause you know that will never come
Now point your fingers up to the sky
If you're playing with fire you will get burned
So sick of liars
Sick of thieves
They all say we should get on our knees
All I breathe is hate
All I smell is fear
Dream as you'll live forever
Live as you'll die today
It takes a second of your time
A second of your time
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play
It takes a second of your time
A second of your time
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play
Let's have it all
Glitter and greed
All I need is the air that I breathe
You say that hate
Has no place in here
Let them hate so long as they fear
The world is screaming
All I breathe is hate
All I smell is fear
Dream as you'll live forever
Live as you'll die today
It takes a second of your time
A second of your time
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play
It takes a second of your time
A second of your time
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play
We are what we think
A change of thoughts can change the world
It takes a second of your time
A second of your time
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play
It takes a second of your time
A second of your time
It takes a moment of your life
So please don't turn away
It's the perfect scene
The perfect play
Let's have it all
Glitter and greed
All I need is the air that I breathe
You say that hate
Has no place in here
Let them hate so long as they fear
If you're playing with fire
You will get burned
If you're playing with fire
You will get burned
I am the hand that feeds you
Will put you down
I can I will I want
Everything will be according to plan
If it's me running this show
I see the world in black and white
I don't care
I won't give up this fight
I'm better than you
And I'll hate you if you don't agree
Oh
Don't you doubt that you're nothing
If you're alone
I'll tell all your friends
While I'm sitting in my throne
I am the hand that feeds you
Will put you down
I can I will I want
Everything will be according to plan
If it's me running this show
I see the world in black and white
Fuck you all
I won't give up this fight
I'm better than you
And I'll hate you if you don't agree
I'm better than you
Can't you see that this means nothing to me
Yeah things didn't had to be this way
Blood brothers 'til it all fades away
You don't need to say nothing at all
How could you walk away from this
We've spent the last few years
How could you turn your back on us
We've been living in a dream
You see the world in black and white
You say you won't give up
You see the world in black and white
You say you won't give up
I won't give up this fight
You see the world in black and white
I won't give up this fight
I am the hand that feeds you
Will put you down
I can I will I want
Everything will be according to plan
If it's me running this show
I'm better than you
And I'll hate you if you don't agree
I'm better than you
Can't you see that this mean nothing to me
Yeah things didn't had to be this way
Blood brothers 'til it all fades away
You don't need to say nothing at all
Nothing at all
I am the hand that feeds you
Will put you down
I made a promise
I'll hold it until my last breath
So easy to begin
Elementary to cease
Think fast you're wasting time
This road ain't painless at all
What does your mind tell you
What words does your heart scream
If you feel this is right
Hold it until your last breath
Let's play this song for the broken
These words will make us take heart
Anyone can give up
It's the easiest thing to do
It's the easiest thing to do
This will feel real until the last night
Don't ask me what it takes
Don't ask me how it feels
I'm pretty sure you can make it
Don't ask me what it takes
Not all that shines is golden
Trying doesn't mean failing
You were born to live
I made a promise
To be true with what I feel
With what I feel
It's been a while since the last time
That I didn't feel this was real
Kind words mean the world
Poisoned words just pass by
Sorry fellow sometime I will go down
But this is not the day
This is not the day
Can you hear the silence
Can you hear the still
Can you hear the quietness
So beautiful at the start
It's been a while since the last time
That I didn't feel this was real
What does your mind tell you
What words does your heart scream
Don't ask me what it takes
Don't ask me how it feels
I'm pretty sure you can make it
Don't ask me what it takes
Not all that shines is golden
Trying doesn't mean failing
You were born to live
Let's play this song for the broken
These words will make us take heart
Let's play this song for the broken
These words will make us take heart
Don't ask me what it takes
Don't ask me how it feels
I'm pretty sure you can make it
Don't ask me what it takes
Not all that shines is golden
Trying doesn't mean failing
You were born to live
etÃÂ´s start a fire put this city to flames
come on baby i know more than you think
so whatÃÂ´s the difference between you and me
the difference is that i stand up for my beliefs
a liar a victim iÃÂ´m empty  a fake
fuck it  who gives a damn anyway
your empty eyes unveil the shape of your face
living in a ghost town we live in a ghost town
i just want to stay here in the dark
this way i wonÃÂ´t look at your face
yeah i heard that you got it all strangers
youÃÂ´re empty just like me
all the promises that you once made
were dead from the start
faces all of them without expressions
words with no meaning  iÃÂ´m broken
emptiness fills the wound
Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
This bitter taste I feel
Another panic attack
It feels like all the walls
Are closing on me
Every path that I chose
I ended lost in a trap
That's why now I feel like I'm frozen
Shit nothing feels real anymore
Every word spoken has no meaning
Wish I could feel just like before
Please take me back to the beginning
Hey man can you feel this heartburn
I'm the fucking enemy
Sorrow it runs in my veins
Life is a valley of mistakes
Things never go as we plan
Why don't you forget it
You better forget
Sorrow it runs in my veins
Life is a valley of mistakes
Things never go as we plan
Why don't you forget it
You better forget
Time heals nothing
You know this life can't be perfect
If it's going around
Will keep coming around
Time heals nothing
You know this life can't be perfect
If it's going around
Will keep coming around
I'm the fucking enemy
This bitter taste I feel
Another panic attack
It feels like all the walls
Are closing on me
Every path that I chose
I ended lost in a trap
That's why now I feel like I'm frozen
I can't pretend anymore
I ain't got nothing to fall for
I hear regret
It's calling my name
But I'm not coming
No not today
Time heals nothing
You know this life can't be perfect
If it's going around
Will keep coming around
Time heals nothing
You know this life can't be perfect
If it's going around
Will keep coming around
Rrow
Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
Time heals nothing at all
I swear I'm gonna break these fucking walls
I made some mistakes
No scars will tear us apart
Please just believe me
I should have known better
Should have known this right from the start
The truth fucking hurts
Young hearts are easily deceived
But it doesn't matter
Cause even if it hurts
Time will put your mind at ease
Will this ever feel sacred
I will find you here with me
If it all comes crashing down
I don't mind I don't mind at all
We've been dancing in the rain
Time has played us once again
All is good when it ends good
I made some mistakes
Didn't care what my heart said
You can't control the things you admire
You just have to stay true to yourself
I have two voices
I have two hearts
Will this feel sacred
One is for the day
But the other one comes out at night
Will this ever feel sacred
I will find you here with me
If it all comes crashing down
I don't mind I don't mind at all
We've been dancing in the rain
Time has played us once again
All is good when it ends good
Give it up for the last time
Last time
I've grown old and tired
I just can't take it anymore
I swear to God it was my fucking last try
Oh
I won't be sleeping anymore
I should have known that the truth hurts
All together for the last time
In this together until we all die
Every motherfucking liar in the house scream
In this together until the day we die
Scars won't keep you apart
From the ones you love
Scars won't keep you apart
From the ones you love
Will this ever feel sacred
I will find you here with me
If it all comes crashing down
I don't mind I don't mind at all
We've been dancing in the rain
Time has played us once again
All is good when it ends good
Mayday the days are passing
You should never forget
The love from your friends
Only the real ones
Will tell you if your face is dirty
Look into my eyes
What do you see
We often take our blessings for granted
Spare nothing live your time
Because we all fall down
If I step into a fire
I know you would come along
Spare nothing live your time
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
We made this happen
We made it on our own
It's written in our hands
So we won't forget
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
Mayday the days are counting
We made these promises
I'm glad to have you here with me
Until this story ends
Look into my eyes
What do you see
We often take our blessings for granted
Spare nothing live your time
Because we all fall
We all fall
We all fall down
Yeah
We made these promises
You are our calling cards
So here's to you
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
We made this happen
We made it on our own
It's written in our hands
So we won't forget
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
We made this happen
We made it on our own
It's written in our hands
So we won't forget
We made this happen
Please don't let it fall behind
Let go like you did before
Living the lie you insist to believe
Twisted thoughts and broken memories
Your reality doesn't exist
This war is far from over
One more battle with your favorite enemy
Run for cover
Shoot from distance
The only way you can face me
You know I wouldn't stand a chance
You know I wouldn't make a sound
I never wanted to be like this
Take it or just go away
You fooled me once
You fooled me twice
I stood by you and you brought me nothing
I gave you life
I gave you my heart
All that you did was tear it apart
I speak my heart
The problem is that you
Don't fucking care
You don't fucking care
This war is far from over
Another note of your favorite melody
This isn't contemplative
Why the hell can't you see me
You know I wouldn't stand a chance
You know I wouldn't make a sound
Out of light like any other star
I hate to say it
But my heart belongs to you
I hate to say it
But my heart belongs to you
Belongs to you
I hate to say it
But my heart belongs to you
Belongs to you
You fooled me once
You fooled me twice
I stood by you and you brought me nothing
I gave you life
I gave you my heart
All that you did was tear it apart
All that you did was tear it apart
All that you did was tear it apart
Side side side side by side
Fill it up
Let's have another one
You see it's early
I just want to have some fun
Life is hard
You play by the rules
I think tonight we can be unreasonable
10 PM where my buddies at
I think tonight it's gonna be great
Drink it up play it loud
Thought when sober
Said when drunk
Is this the place
Where we can have some fun
Hey dude can you buy me a beer
I think tonight we can be unreasonable
I can read the message in your eyes
Come along have a good time baby
You know how we're gonna end this night
You know where we're going
I can read the message in your eyes
Come along have a good time baby
You know how we're gonna end this night
We're gonna end this night
3 AM dude where did I park my car
Sorry girl I don't live too far
She doesn't look that good anymore
I don't know where my buddies at
I think tonight I'm gonna be sick
I can read the message in your eyes
Come along have a good time baby
You know how we're gonna end this night
You know where we're going
I can read the message in your eyes
Come along have a good time baby
You know how we're gonna end this night
We're gonna end this nightembrace the pain
embrace the pain
the only thing you know
just pull just pull
just pull the fucking plug
whats keep you alive
whats saves from yourself
from anger frustration
the pain that pulls you down
Erase your mind
erase your mind
youÃÂ´ve now become a lie
this lethal infection
infernal liquid consumes you
inside
this cage of hate
you rot and waste
no sense of life
in pitch black downfall
downfall
you will be
crushed by the hand of fate
youÃÂ´re drowning in your tears
surrender not an option
something you cant forgive
rise from your ashes
youÃÂ´ve been called to fight
rise from the depths
take back your life
you find yourself ready to confess
beneath the innocent silhouette
the fallen waits with the gun to his head
life will teach you to act like a snake
crushed by the hand of fate
youÃÂ´re drowning in your tears
surrender not an option
something you cant forgive
rise from your ashes
youÃÂ´ve been called to fight
rise from the depths
take back your life
Meaningless acceleration
memories twist your mind
trapped in a chain reaction
night after night
Minefield sensation
mutilation per mile
full metal projectile
nothing hits that hard
There is no pride
there is no fault
the innocent will succumb
and the guilty will prevail
Before the hammer throws the sentence
before this moment marks your soul
one irresponsible act
will change your fate
your dreams turn to ashes
your future rests in peace
There is no pride
there is no fault
the innocent will succumb
and the guilty will
Crash
no last goodbyes
Crash
an violent ride
red lights and pavement
Crash
no last Goodbyes
Crash
an violent ride
red lights and faces
We don't care about no others
speed will show the way
adrenaline must flow through these veins
we live fast die young
one by one you know the words
decree what you want from me
this life wont replace my loss
in my heart in my heart they will live
before the hammer throws the sentence
before this moment marks your soul
one irresponsible act
will change your fate
your dreams turn to ashes
your future rests in peace
Burn in hell
in hell
Crash
no last goodbyes
Crash
an violent ride
red lights and pavement
Crash
no last Goodbyes
Crash
an violent ride
red lights and faces
are you feeling alone
are you feeling down
you know what you want
you want feel the rush
drop inject inhale
let your spirit flow
you are in the green zone
nothing can hurt you here
you are safe from the world
safe from yourself
Once inside you realize
that you just cant control
hold your breath and start to pray
the cage wont let you go
the agony will slow the time
and play cruel tricks on your mind
sleeping all day high night
reality comes at dawn
wake up wake up
you must work
you need more you need more
yes you need
you need more you need more
get a job get a job
you must work you must
relax your next fix is coming
this is the last time
you know I know
fuck this
walking in circles
there's no escape
hunger that devours
kneeling by the power
destroying your brain
destroying the man
shadows in the night
dead in the morning
no name no sign of memories
a blanked file
Under the moon the dreamer wanders
under the sun the derelict suffers
food will only
feed your eyes
the real meal is
there outside
inside the cage the chains wont break
you have to feel the rush again
consuming your flesh and your skin
bones and dust in the end
fighting for survival
fighting for pleasure
prepare for war
prepare for the last hunt
death by the sword
death by the trigger pull
soldiers playing god
making death abundant
KILL
for religion
BURN
for demonstration
RAPE
for dominion
murder nature
PLAGUE
contamination
BLOOD
our currency
FAMINE
desolation
once we kill with clubs
now we burn with nukes
hunter killer culture
delivering death in all forms
stones and spears
grenades and flames
the reapers scythe
will cut and maine
we will obliterate
well wipe them out
fight and die until the end
carrying my flag to the grave
primal pilot engage destroy
murder nature will kill us all
this is murder nature
WeÃÂ´ll fight die destroy
defy ourselves seeking for nothing
searching for everything that has been lost
lose ourselves to the ancient
older than 
than good and evil
as the lavas that restlessly roll
their sulphurous currents down yaneek
in the ultimate climes of the pole
sanctify
for what 
what I believed
purify
for I've been blind
sacrifice
to feed 
to feed the unknown
we must leave this place behind
this cursed land forgotten in time
between the sadness 
the absence of hope
in absolute confusion 
the terror posses our souls
deep in a haunted 
cursed
cursed reign
where life death space and time
join forces to kill and maine
human 
monstrous 
unspoken terrors
forbidden secrets
mountains of madness
take me to the abyss
mountains of madness
show me the truth
mountains of madness
take me home
god help the dreamer whose mad visions shew
those dead eyes set in crystal gulfs below
sanctify
for what 
what I believed
purify
for I've been blind
sacrifice
to feed 
to feed the unknown
we must leave this place behind
this cursed land forgotten in time
mountains of madness
take me to the abyss
mountains of madness
show me the truth
mountains of madness
take me home
hunters will be hunted
death brings life
saints will be sinners
angels crucify
holy and profane
morph into survival
morph for my survival
I
I will control
I will defeat
the weak inside of me and you
you will submit
you will obey
dominion as it alters
time
time wont conceal
time will reveal
the weakness behind all these walls
walls of deceit
walls of disease
dominion as it alters
How much dead time
do we need to fully heal ourselves
How do we know
if we are ready to trust again
how
how
why can't we try
to forget the sins that wrecked our lives
can we deny
all the evil that lives in us
letÃÂ´s pretend that you don't hate me
letÃÂ´s pretend
that you are full of love
waves of time drag me down
oceans of memories collide
now you find yourself alone
digging down into this hole
you didn't let it go
all your hope
your hope is gone
betrayed by impulse
you didn't let yourself go
just leave it be
is too late to know the truth
you forsake me
for everything I have done to you
letÃÂ´s pretend you don't hate me
letÃÂ´s pretend you are full of love
waves of time drag me down
an ocean of memories collides
now you find yourself alone
digging down into this hole
you didn't let it go
all your hope is gone
betrayed by impulse
you didn't let yourself go
Take one good look at your life
and tell me what is wrong
Spoiling the masses
hiding the facts
the truth that they will never know
How much can you take
how much to suffocate
Dead eyes behold the pillage
profit from the sickness
Breaking the silence screaming out
breaking away from all the pain
Awaking the giant set us free
back to where we belong
I am the strength deep inside
I am the burning in your heart
Searching for something they will never find
running to something until they die
This is the time to break out
in the pull of the tides
this empire will retreat
This is the time to speak out
the return of the tides
brings what we deserve
we deserve something worst
we deserve something to regret
my right to fight has been granted
my time to suffer has come
Breaking the silence screaming out
breaking away from all the pain
awaking the giant set us free
taking the reins of fate
Riding the storm breaking out
burning the empire down
changing the powers without remorse
back to where we belong
Reflecting retracting
destroying the truth
denying existence
the image so pure
Transforming deceiving
consumed by the fear
narcissist
by nature
Behold
my face turns to grey
so lost
the yellow brickÃÂ´s way
so dark
memories seem to fade
so far
like everybody's name
Gossip retard
spreading those lies
the only reason that you keep it alive
Aggression rejection
bring false intentions
greeted with silence
Look at me
Here on the wall
telling me anything I want
talk to me
As I speak
one step to fall into the mirror
the void
no sign of redemption no mercy for the weak
I came to destroy I came to defeat
You ask for salvation
at the end of the line
no more chances for beauty in disguise

New time has begun when defenders unite
Hold your lance up high and stay alive
I wanna be a rock star
I put my black leather tights on
Up for a motorbike ride
Motor motorbike ride motorcycle ride
I'm gonna be a rebel
Born to be in the spotlight
Hooked on a six string fight
Six six string fight in a guitar hero night
Hangingin a dream of illusions
Filled with emotions of fame
Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel
The riders the fighters
The renegades on wheels
Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel
The riders the fighters
The renegades on wheels
In the rhythm of a back beat
I shred my crazy guitar
Like a heavy metal star
Heavy heavy metal star like a heavy metal star
My exes are getting bloodshot
By the battle of the rock gods
I'm a guitar hero nerd
Guitar guitar hero nerd
but the best you've ever heard
Caught in a dream of illusions
Welcomne in the hall of fame
Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel
The riders the fighters
The renegades on wheels
Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel
The riders the fighters

We are riders the fighters
The renegades on wheels
Here come the rock stars
The night crawlers
Loaded with steel

The renegades on wheels
Time has come we'll never rest
At the end of the battle we fight
No more tears no more pain
Glory for us all
See the burning horizon flames in the night
Oh they rise up high
Oh for the battle we fight
A Kingdom will come a keeper of the crown
A call for rebellion scream for revenge
Oh for freedom we stand
Hymns of redemption we're singing along
A hail to the band of the strong
A kingdom will come far beyond
We are guardians of the crown
We are the ones we are the ones
We are wanderers on the run
We carry on we marching on
To the calley of the crimson dawn
So glorious we're standing strong
Together we keep up the sign
We are the ones we are the ones
We are wanderers wanderers on the run
Oh for freedom we stand
By fire and sword through the heat of the night
Oh for the battle we fight

We are the lost ones in the emptiness of life
No fear in darkness not scared of loneliness
High up the mountaints across the barren fields
We're on our way to the promised land
Get away get away let out my soul
Keep away keep away tear down the wall
While the shades of the crimson dawn
Still hide the power of light
Breaks the sign of our victory
The seals to paradise
We are the ones we are the ones
We are wanderers on the run
We carry on we marching on
To the calley of the crimson dawn
So glorious we're standing strong
Together we keep up the sign
We are the ones we are the ones
We are wanderers wanderers on the run

Into the glorious land of light
In the distance there's a light
Leads us through the misty night
To the place to the promised land of deliverance
Back to the light
See the tears in my eyes reflecting new life
Heard all my cries oh I will be there
We're longing for the time we're going back
Back to the land of light
We climb the stairs up we're coming home
To the source of life to our peasure dome
The reason to believe the answer to everything
More than ever when worlds collide
Overwhelmed and full of pride
Back to the light
See the tears in my eyes reflecting new life
Heard all my desperate cries oh I will be there
We're longing for the time we're going back
Back to the Land of Light

What's right what's wrong not a discriminable
You are you are
Hello Hello a man in the mirror a mirror bizarre
There is a sun in the dark
A touch of evil comes apart
All your tears all your fears
In the end the game restarts
See the sun in the night
A big sin city light
Feel the power of the universe inside
But the game of life collides
Hush hush don't be shy how cynical
No ID on the PC so practical
No way back to reality too sensible
Caught in the act no respect so tragical
This is the end of this magical opera opera
There is a sun in the dark
A touch of evil comes apart
All your tears all your fears
In the end the game restarts
See the sun in the night
A big sin city light
Feel the power of the universe inside
But the game of life collides
But the game of life collides
But the game of life collides
But the game of life collides
There is a sun in the dark
A touch of evil comes apart
All your tears all your fears
In the end the game restarts
See the sun in the night
A big sin city light
Feel the power of the universe inside
But the game of life collides

High over the rainbow over seven seas
Far away see the sign see the light in the sky
In the valley of kingdom
After the battle we won
Hear the silence of courageous souls
Resting forever
All the warriors are marching
'n riding on and on
For freedom they're longing for
Until the day their time will come
High and higher let's ride
Let's ride up high high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away far away
See the sign see the sign
The light in the sky
Let's fly up high high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away far away
See the light see the light
The shine in the night
In the line of fire
They keep their steel up high
Under the rays of the blazing sun
Controlled by an electric eye
At the end of the ocean
Over the top of the hills
Where the rivers of destiny
Flow in the lake of eternity
High and higher let's fly
Let's ride up high high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away far away
See the sign see the sign
The light in the sky
Let's fly up high high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away far away
See the light see the light
The shine in the night
Let's ride on the rainbow over seven seas
On the screen he's playing along
Doesn't know what's right or wrong
On the edge to the dark danger zone
He turns on the start to obsession
The evil casts a spell inside
Doesn't know what's wrong or right
Like Doctor Jekyll or else Mr Hide
War craft game of fear
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes the endless dream remains
The evil casts a spell inside
Doesn't know what's wrong or right
Ain't Doctor Jekyll nor even Mr Hide
War craft game of fear
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes the endless dream remains
War craft dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes the endless dream remains
Once again 
Once again the frantic thrill remains
War craft game of fear
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes the endless dream remains
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Annihilate the racketeers
Close your eyes the endless dream remains

Another night another unholy breed
Another soul is twisting in agony
A widow's praying to the gods of salvation again
Welcome into the heart of darkness my son
We are rising to a challenge
And at nightfall it begins
Relieve her of her majesty
And be the chosen one
See the sign the cosmic energy
Leads your way along the path of fame
Shades disappear a soul full of pride
For nemesis we'll die
See the sign holy prophecy
free the world terra liberty
Beyond all the fear hearts will be strong
for the terra liberty
The crystal mountains reflect your silhouette
may your courage break the spell of the damned
In the tower she is lost
Trapped in a cage of stone
Relieve her of her majesty
and be the chosen one
See the sign the cosmic energy
Leads your way along the path of fame
Shades disappear a soul full of pride
For nemesis we'll die
See the sign holy prophecy
free the world terra liberty
Beyond all the fear hearts will be strong
for the terra liberty
And when the night comes
I can feel the wind so cold
The battle has begun
and I can hear the screams of war
for terra liberty
See the sign the cosmic energy
Leads your way along the path of fame
Shades disappear a soul full of pride
For nemesis we'll die
See the sign holy prophecy
free the world terra liberty
Beyond all the fear hearts will be strong

I I'm on my way back there's no regret
There's no appreciation
I I lost all my faith it's killing the blaze
Erases the flame of glory
Wait we wait for a sign longing for life
It's time to ride we're riding the sky
There's no need to cry
Flying free like and eagle
On the way to eternity
No more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain
I I fell of the track dropped of the edge
by a slam of my self damnation
I I'm taking the blame but memories remain
Raising the lust for living
Wait we wait for a sign longing for life
It's time to ride we're riding the sky
There's no need to cry
Flying free like and eagle
On the way to eternity
No more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain

Everybody's gonna get a flame inside
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody's gonna get a flame inside
Flying free like and eagle

No more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain
Flying free like and eagle
Spread your wings and glide away
Live your dream live forever
United in harmony
A contest of our lost illusions

Never surrender don't cry try to survive
You've always been a gambler in life
Charge your power never hide
Imagine the victory is near
ardent we fight  to get a second life
Any time anywhere in a virtual universe
Sometimes somewhere
space legends are marching on
Don't be afraid of strangers
it's just a fictious scene
A battlefield of bits and bytes
Enemies on screen
Imagine the victory is near
ardent we fight  to get a second life
Any time anywhere in a virtual universe
Sometimes somewhere space legends space legends
Any time anywhere a strange and crazy world
Sometime somewhere
space legends will be marching on

Sometimes somewhere space legends space legends
Any time anywhere a strange and crazy world

Times were hard without you by my side
showing me the wrong path from the right
Guiding me showing me the way
Always glowing inside forever and a day
I will burn each part of my soul
just to feel your warmness in this cold
Shivering my fingers touched your hands
No sign of life I didn't understand
Guiding me showing me the way
Always glowing inside forever and a day
I will burn each part of my soul
just to feel your warmness in this cold
Shivering my fingers touched your hands
No sign of life I didn't understand
Crossing the desert alone
the endless bright oceans of sand
No walls and no borders on sight
Seeking the truth
Inside my soul silent mourns
Blind my mind inside my heart
tempests of sorrows drown my faith
Went into the wild merciless place in my mind
Where I had to find some kind of peace inside
Wounds of the past would they ever be healed
Can you stop the pain and the ache
Better tomorrows never to come
Bloody distant screams seeking the truth
Desert was silent and I was on my way home
The soft wind of night was tickling my face
made me feel alright erased all my trace
The wind start to harshen I see a wall of sand
A tempest was marching covering the land
The wrath of the Sahara was eating me alive
Unleashed all its power the elements on strife
I beg for my life
the demons took over my mind
The mighty sands just spared my life
I saw the tempest from inside
The desert spirit was with me
No chance to run no way to hide
it smiles to me and set me free
Carrying more than I can stand
falling into the abyss
Passing out losing grip
losing my faith lost the battle
Lost my soul by the way
Here's my judgement
I lived a life full of regrets
My disbelief the hate and loneliness
consumed my soul from deep inside
I slowly lost my reason and my mind
and fell into the madness
Waiting for my day to come
Longing for eternal peace
Stop the battle close my eyes for eternity
Madness
Desperate when I was on my own
Then you came like in my dreams
Tenderly your whispers echoed in my heart
Which I thought dead
With you I'm feeling warm
I'm alive when you hold my hand
Hold my hand and get me out
From that hole I the dark
Let me see that gleam of light
Let it shine on my heart
Lost in the dark with my fears
No stars above no one to love
Tears comes run down my face
And they fade as they fall
I heard your call called my name
To hold my hand bring me back to life
Yes now I'm alive back to the real world
Now I'm feeling better
When you're by my side I don't need to hide
I reached the bottom you brought me back
When I was drowning you were in my mind
Oh oh
I feel the fever Inside my soul
Burning desire deep inside my heart
Now try to breathe just find some space
You are my last chance my only way out
Oh oh
When you talk to mewhen you hold my hand
Hold my hand and get me out
From that hole I the dark
Let me see that gleam of light
Let it shine on my heart
Deep breath and sweet whispers
burning passion bursting from your lips
A deadly addiction
No I never thought that blaze could fade
But I just can't forgive
Suffering every minute every moment every night
Take away all the memories with you
No more rain let the sun rise let the world be
So take away all the memories with you
All with you All with you
Sweet bitter memories you left behind
Does it really matter now that I no longer care
So let it go because I did not know
that your heart was made of stone
How did I believe your lies
How I drowned my soul into your eyes
Take away all the memories with you
No more rain let the sun rise let the world be
So take away all the memories with you
All with you All with you
I'm feeling anger
Run within my veins
For the ones who died
lost their lives in vain
Pain ain't no hope no more
misery is spreading faster
fallen angels cry
Blood tears and sorrows
The lonely nights spent on the front
Made me blind to all the pain around
Brave soldiers fall for no cause at all
Mighty blood quenching a thirsty ground
Soldiers fight to death
Showing blind obedience
suffering martyrdom
Tell me how could we
Pretend to build the peace
Brothers can't you see
That war is all there is
They're telling lies
Closing their eyes
Who pays the price
With their own lives
Dirty deeds that I have to forget
No turning back
Now my choices I have made
Standing tall I will not be afraid
Those things I left behind
like the dust swept by the wind
Could I stand with no fear
Even though it might be hard
Life is a game you can always play until you die
I won't give up I'll carry on and fight
Believe in my faith survive the deepest dark
My regrets are now all gone no more despair
I think that now I'm freed I finally see the end
Those things I left behind
like the dust swept by the wind
Could I stand with no fear
Even though it might be hard
Life is a game you can always play until you die
I won't give up I'll carry on and fight
Believe in my faith survive the deepest dark
Don't you see the red rain is falling down on us
The pain and hate always rise where is the trust
I'm living in this empty world
It's like a dead man  nothing works
Why so many tears have had to fall
don't you know I'm tired of it all
Our wishes and bloody hopes everything is burned
And to the Lord I want to return
My eyes are so tired because of what I've seen
Why so many tears have had to fall
don't you know I'm tired of it all
So take me to another world
where there are only white birds
I flew when the planes were safe
I cried happy tears in happy days
I left all the crises and the wars
my heart is tired now
It's closing its doors
And I walked on the golden sand
when the sky was so beautiful
I remember the first kiss
the son and wife whom I miss
First words I wrote on a candlelight
and the letters I read through the night
It's like a shockwave to your brain
A voice that makes you go insane
You feel that fire in your eyes
no more chains and no more ties
That freedom running in your vain
under the pressure and the pain
You're getting just as cold as ice
Like you'd get 7 with one dice
When you're feeling wild immature as a child
Feel like an atomic bomb
From the cradle to the tomb
From the desert to the pole
Just let there be rock 'n roll
Even when you're feeling low
in the worst days that you might know
Try to pick up your guitar
Raise the volume to the stars
When you're feeling wild immature as a child
now hear our community's words
from northern side of this earth
words about your curse
We want this to be heard
what we now have learned
We bring this to you now
when northwind blows
This message full of darkness
but you'll see it was the truth
on day of your doom
You want this to remain
world of endless pain
Ocean of fire shall blaze
from desire of evilness
in land of hope
New king shall rise from there
New king share rise from there
You want this to remain
world of endless pain
Children in hunger
Fathers fighting in unholy war of evil
end of wordly glory
Hear those whispers from above
our bell has begin to toll
creed has twisted in our sanity
we all shall bury ourselfs in the sand of lies
seeds of emptiness we are
so mortal souls we are
see now what we have become
hope that we won't live forever
silence is here to stay
but that's what we need in our impurity
we are welcome to end
this is the sign for humanity
The end
The end
Cold hand is stretching
to the portal of destiny
dark dimension shall clarify
the conception of mortal one
line between two worlds
pain and irrevocable
from deep shall found oblivion
eternal unknown
how short is the bridge
between two worlds
how is mind calling
for cold death
line between two worlds
pain and irrevocable
from deep shall found oblivion
eternal unknown
sleeping in cradle of white lake
child of oblivion
northern wind is closing the bridge slowly
When light no longer rose to kiss me
I swore to tear Heaven asunder
As flights of fallen angels wished me
Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder
Eclipsing violent centuries
Like a dark scar over France
Enter the nascent Gilles de Rais
A warrior and a scholar
He fought for Joan Of Arc
Before she met with martyrdom in flames
Far from fairytale
A deathshead on his sail
A light that would not fail
Beneath her spell
But the crucifix was veiled
When his decadence prevailed
In a drench of red regaled
He was shat out of Hell
Shat out of Hell
Frozen in iniquity
A passion for awe in an age of grief
His wealth and power led him on
To the tainted gates of Babylon
Born beneath the howling stars
In a shower of golden Lys
A wolfcub with the world between his sabre teeth
Torn between extremes of faith
The pious and the priests
Far from fairytale
The coffin and the nail
Descending to the pale
Under the spell
Of alchemists who failed
To clench the menstrual grail
In a drench of red regaled
He was shat out of Hell
Shat out of Hell
Grown so morbid without war
The wine corrupted nightmares spored
His Lord's betrayal played no more
He beat upon the Devil's door
Demanding pleasures to replace
Joan Of Arc her epic grace
Had set aflame his wolfheart with her truth
And when she died his life of pride
Was lost to God and in his crimes
He turned to raising Satan with the proof
Soon nightly unsightly
Offerings were made on a vulgar altar
And slowly but surely
The darkness answered like a falling star
Far from fairytale
Insanity exhaled
A fullblown winter gale
Under it's spell
Innocents assailed
Were entered and impaled
In a drench of red regaled
He was shat out of Hell
Shat out of Hell
Perverse seductive cruel as sin
An egotist he mourned
Both war and glory schooled to win
Whatever bored imagination spawned
Her penultimate sighs
Called softy on the kindling wind
And then a golden flash like the onset of Heaven
Leaving her screams breaking my heart
And in the grip of fire
I knew the death of love
Where will you be when they tense for warfare
What will you see with your innocence there
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they tense for warfare
Where will you be when God is glorifying
There we will be between the dead and dying
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when God is glorifying
Prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain
Devoted to the votive holy standard above
'By command of the king of Heaven'
Came the death of love
Where will you be when they're vilifying
How will they see when the truth is blinding
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they're vilifying
Where will you be when the dark is rising
How will you keep from it's terrorizing
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when the dark is rising
Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
But visions and ambition
Never listened to submission
And she was on a mission from the highest above
To Lord upon the slaughter
Like a sword through hissing water
She arose where archers sought her
For the death of love
The righteous death of love
Gilles adored her drama
Her suit of pure white armour
Blazed against the English in a torrent of light
And as they rallied onto night
A cancer fled his soul
Dissolving
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame a Valkyrie
She made him click without desire
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when they caught her breath
Her words would leave a scar
'For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars'
How will you know if the sky is burning
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when Babel builds my fire
Will you not flee and label me pariah
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they light my pyre
Aligned with Joan in all
That was enthroned and divine
He swore to score the crimes
Jackdaws poured on this dove
Crimes he knew alone
Derived from minds of the blind
The church unfurled for murder perched
Upon the death of love
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame a Valkyrie
She claimed the skies were lit with spires
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when she fought for breath
Her words would leave a scar
'For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars'
Oh how my rampant desire
Ripped from the presence of God
Now hungered like a beast
For the knowledge of evil
When Joan was burnt
He knew malevolence
At the heart of all
A cold and jagged abyss bled of sense
The throne he earned
Through God's benevolence
Started his own fall
Clothing ragged dogma in his own magnificence
Here the stench the gold events
The bold inventions of the will
Every wanton bent desire went fulfilled
A Daemon sat upon the top of the world
Like a Herod over Genesis
They sang hosannas as his banners unfurled
Kissing terrors with paralysis
His brash canvas insulted the view
moving heaven and earth to please the
Tumultitudes whom his strange retinue drew
To assert the thirteenth Caesar
The thirteenth Caesar
Ichor kicked inside his veins
The thirteenth Caesar
War was licked for shame
The thirteenth Caesar
Sicker but just as vain
The thirteenth Caesar
Gilles De Rais
When Joan was burnt
He knew malevolence
At the heart of all
He swore henceforth he would serve evil alone
Here the stench the gold events
The insurrection of his will
Theatre and feasts past the ken of mortal men
Every wanton bent desire went fulfilled
A Daemon sat upon the top of the world
Like a Herod over genesis
They sang hosannas as his banners unfurled
Striking terror intro menaces
Suetonius and Ovid
Filled the moonstruck dreams
With the purple of Rome
His Venus of arenablood was dead
And he was storming home
God can deny nothing to a De Rais
And should He ever
There is always the Devil
Here sat Babylon
Fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
Where the decadent tastes of Hell grew strong
Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom
Dusk descended like a final curtain
On this stage only death was certain
Singing through the turrets
Like a velvet serenade
Played near a grave
Sentries and gentry afforded the bloom
Of a red setting sun and a bloodletting moon
Applauded then accorded them
Portents of doom
Almost too soon
They pissed upon the winds
That rocked the cradles
Laughing over those hovels grovelling to wolves
They kissed and sinned
Under overstocked tables
As the world outside grew sodden and mauled
Here sat Babylon
Fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
Where the decadent tastes of Hell grew strong
Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom
Gilles sat sipping damson absinthe
From a goblet made of bone
As lightning ripped and danced upon
The flagstones
Wayward fantasies marched on home
Now the treetops bowed to whisper
In a thin Disney veneer
They knew the howls so exquisitely honed
Were those of children disappeared
They'd listened to the winds
Heard the murdered Abel
Rechristened in the stone jaws of Tiffauges
Where the list of sins
Grew beyond a fable
They now roared abroad restless with debauch
Restless with debauch
Restless with debauch
This tragic kingdom
Would see God's angels walk
Away
Satanic enigmatic
His black magic was ecstatic
Megalomaniac in titanic displays
Dressed in the best
Wicked britches of the West
He cut a mourning figure in glorious swathe
But all his nightmares would come true
Drowning in a stream of conscious pleasure
Here sat Babylon
Fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
Where the decadent tastes of Hell grew strong
Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom
Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom
The moon bleared through the skeletal trees
Averting her face from congenital deeds
Thus eves grew murky haunted grieved
About this place laced with demon seed
Blanchet a priest his book of lies
Exonerated him from Gilles' crimes
Announced his fears one night of sighs
A night for cursing nursery rhymes
The track gets blacker for this tragic kingdom
Gilles' frightening wealth his tightening grip
Steered to near ruin in successive years
Of the most of excess and the best of it here
I conjure you Barron Satan Beelzebub
By the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
By the Virgin Mary and all the saints
To appear in person so that you may speak to us
And fulfill our desires
Come at my bidding and I will grant you
Whatever you want however vile
And the curtailing of my life
He would rise triumphant
All done up
On a plume of raven wings
Trafficking with sycophants
Sharing his cup
Amidst other graver things
Alchemists and sorcerers stitched his head
With the stench of pitch and myrrh
The devout faded out but the pagan remained
The candles burnt low and still nothing came
He would have his demon
He would have his vice
All save his soul was up for sacrifice
Despite their raising not a single hair
Everything stank of witchcraft there
From the stained chapel to the statued lawn
In Caprineum on the lake
To the still lit crypts and the slit of dawn
Sliding down the towers it all smelt fake
He needed answers not advice
Intending to devise
A lengthy train of torture for the fool
Who thought a seance would suffice
Or sighted furred in dragonflies
The signature of Satan on a wall
Sweetest Maleficia
Planchette to Blanchet from ghosts to a priest
Returning with a spider for the poisonous feast
The Italian astrologer Prelati spinning sin
His fingertips were scented with
The tears from seraphim cheeks
Part glamour and a hammer
Cadaverous and glib
Commanding in a voice of frozen peaks
He would have his demon
He would have his gold
Out of control Gilles' soul was sold
Under mistletoe and the glistening snow
Kissing in the shadow of abandoned saviours
From the banquet hall to the stable gates
A graveyard shift in tone
Sank upon the castle like a papal weight
Or a deep philosophical stone
The air was sick with trepidation
Despair and desperation
Then he fixed his covenant in blood
Now all was rich and tapestried
Fragrant wine to shitty mead
His new world opened with a claret flood
Time was right this wretched night
To etch the circles clear again
So too Prelati brought the dark
It's name was Barron eyes like catastrophic tar
Imbibed with fire
Entangled in a dream
The mirrors full of steam
His last attempt to grasp at God
Lay blackened in a holy fog
And now there were only devils to pursue
Gilles was wrapped in a velvet spell
Of Hell and her seductions
The assassinated days as a Caesar gone by
Barron spitting acid as his magical guide
Sweetest Maleficia
So potent was the star under which I was born
That I have done no one in the world has done
Nor can ever do
Praeclarum
Custodem
Ovium
Lupum
All Saints Day the taint of rain
Blood and mud and thunder all the same
To those who close their ranks to Gille's men
Bricqueville Prelati and De Sille
Brittle angels out to pasture once again
Torture garden rules of thumb apply
To sacred flesh and the naked eye
Golgothic this erotica
Stinking of honey and worse sulphur
So black was the magic in this tragical kingdom
That the superstitions grew
Wise to the wolves that surprised their children
Gagged in sacks and dragged back to
Tiffauges
It's roads now home to a beautiful stranger
Lifting her veil
Spinning her lies
Tender eyes neverending danger
It grows
A rose that chose death for it's bedmuck
Prickles in wait
Thanking her spies
Trickling thighs her only hiccup
And though she walks the forest trails
She's far from innocent or frail
That night is rife with celebration
The tower sings
Where so much foul illumination
Strikes a lighthouse for the things
Mid sour dreams
A beauty pageant for the gathering damned
Of slaughtered lambs and tortured screams
Praeclarum
Custodem
Ovium
Lupum
Torture garden rules of thumb apply
To sacred flesh and the naked eye
Golgothic this erotica
Stinking of honey and worse sulphur
So black was the magic in this tragical kingdom
In this castle of loupgarou
When moonstruck veins inflamed deranged on
A parcel of victims now tied to
Tiffauges
Engorged on the hordes of the anorexic
Cherubim forced
Naked and blind
A holocaust mind designed their exit
A libertine so grim
Sometimes tore them limb from limb
Slitting their throats
Pissing on graves
Jesus saved but the devil made him
Praeclarum
Custodem
Ovium
Lupum
Sometimes I beheaded them
with daggers with poniards with knives
Sometimes I suspended them in my room
And when they were languishing
I committed with them the evils of the flesh
The evening air laps thick about
The stagnant moat that Tiffauges claims
As dusk now slips away
Where taught to run the rotten tongue
Of a hotter GÃÂÃÂ¶tterdÃÂÃÂ¤merung
Has started licking like a flame
Whispers in the dismal mist
Are full of crystal promises
Black rites begun in earnest
Ignite Hell's hungry furnace
Behold the bold inauguration of the darkside
Demonic passions climbing
Illfated stars aligning
The tide of blood is rising
His gifts will be providing
Unmasked the phantom lord De Rais
Haunts the furthest tower
Wherein death has sucked the hour
There throttled gasps tantamount to foreplay
And drooling razors next to come
Unspool red secrets from the young
The moon grinned full the games were chaste
When the children first arrived
Now midnight shadows crawl apace
To darken counsel with their lives
Flesh and ecstasy as sport
Are immortal vices of the highest order
Wherein devilry holds sway
Their songs of Necronomicon
Spoke out of Gilles De Rais
Each murdered son each frozen rose
Handpicked was gently fed
To the sumptuous one in black and those
Whose lives were thrown in with the dead
The candles lit the stage was set
As it was in sainted days
When censers swung and banners hung
On the Siege of Orleans on the painted Seine
Now the castle floats in the drifting fog
Torn from it's moorings
Like a shipwreck dredged from Hell
As innocents entreat a shifting God
Their voices soaring
On a silver tide to heaven
On a knife edge as they fell
The blade would plunge in virulent arcs
Such wounds would stretch away
By the fireside warmed to creative sparks
Of the monster Gilles De Rais
Gilded Gilles De Rais
Comets vomited
The restless bells of crime
Peeled back skin from broken bones
Of angels cut from the nicks of time
Festering faces with painted eyes
The prettiest kept to be thrust inside
Gaping necromantic from the mantleside
Caked in kissed goodbyes
Days faded in decay
The stench of perfume lied
No horror in the glades of man
Was left for Barron to provide
So unique was the beat of his poisoned heart
And it's sordid morbid crack
No further atrocity could possibly surpass
Unrewarded bored he turned his back
Something thicker than despair
Rides upon the midnight air
The smell of blood the taste of prey
We spy you hiding Gilles de Rais
Under August swelter
After banquet and soiree
When spiced wine and song
Have further heated veins
To the ninth degree as tenacula
Hold another body in their sway
Gilles retires from the grasping fires
That will ashen the remains
Darkness incarnate
Demons in his semen
That once clung about the throats
Of children dragged from cellars to his rooms
Now permeate the castle
All who sleep dream of the goat
That dark eclectic harbinger of doom
Nightingales sang of tragedy
Whispers were made of blasphemy
Vain insane this brute aloof
Drew tainted veils over bitter truth
The stairs ran helterskelter
His bedchamber besieged
By phantoms who sheltered
In it's furs remorse
Sought to overwhelm him
Like a lantern of disease
That shone on rotten faces
Of those murdered out in force
Darkness incarnate
Fleeing ghosts so indisposed
To his Satanic love
Of children dragged from cellars to his feast
He rose a carnal wind opposed
To those that sat above
Tearing out into the forest like a beast
The night wind sang of tragedy
Whispers were made of blasphemy
Vain insane this brute aloof
Drew tainted sails over naked truth
Madness clouded everything
Like a lycanthropic shroud
And through it's ghastly lineaments he saw
The trees become obscenities
Semen drip from every bough
As if he rooted Nature like a whore
Dryads tongued under skirts of leaves
Surrendering branches that slenderly pleased
The Mocking orifices and the forest on her knees
Then once besotted knotted trunks now grew
Rotten venereal cancerous blue
Death is only a matter of a little pain
Beneath the sallow moonlight
In a wonderland of pain
Gilles fled back to the castle
Terrified and drained
He sought his deep red velvet bed
And the sleep it preordained
Exhausted forced into the dead
The creep of nightmares came again
Madness clouded everything
Like a lycanthropic shroud
And through it's ghastly lineaments he saw
Hundreds of slain children
Some came crawling disembowelled
To where he stretched out howling on all fours
Corpses tore at his legs and knees
As he clawed to the cross begging reprieve
From a Lord that soared above the awful scene
He sobbed and wept no voice was left
To scream the dream was not drubbed yet
He heard the horrors hiss beside him
'Herod you'll regret'
'Who hears the tears of nightfall
Who steers the spears so spiteful'
Oh my dearest angels go pray to God for me
Awaking in a sweat
Forsaking pleasure for regret
Another night of blight had slowly passed
The morning skies once fresh and bright
Darkened down no near twilight
Gilles wandered as in purgatory
Beyond the grave of his estate
Neither Heaven Hell or peasantry
Were present save projected hatred
He knew suspicion he felt derision
And grief like a sharpened stake
Pierce his heart and now the start
Of his unknitting began to take
Vain glorious a Lord devout
He thought his soul exempt
From guilt and doubt there's no way out
Ten leagues beneath contempt
He drank an ocean quoting Joan the maiden
A vampire's pious rant
His hot blood stank of devotion laden
With bias for love's covenant
Awaking in a sweat
Forsaking pleasure for regret
His choired chapel sighed with his laments
As accusations reached a roar
Investigations breached the door
He put up nothing save his favours in defense
The Church stirred in it's Roman lair
The grease had long been spent
Now all tongues spat at Tiffauges there
Ten leagues beneath contempt
Just one falter
One misplaced deed
And Gilles would be undone
As he teetered on the verge of defeat
Profaning God's altar
Bursting in on evening Mass
He threatened there to crucify the priest
Drunk on fiery wine
With the storm lashing behind
He then threw this Philistine
To his foulest dungeon
And money owed or not
The Priest released or left to rot
His blatant sacrilege begot
A war machine of papal Rome
They came for him in mourning splendour
With the blessing of the Saints
His fawning grin in sweet surrender
A lesson in enforced restraint
He knew suspicion he felt derision
And fear like a sharpened stake
Pierce his heart and now the start
Of his unknitting began to take
He thought courts bought with golden crowns
Rich Bishops he could tempt
But traitor's gate was sought and found
Ten leagues beneath contempt
Ten leagues beneath contempt
This is the moment I go to God
Burning like derision on the prism of night
Meant to overpower and bedizen his light
The moon was black
Devil may care
Three times he'd glared before his judges
Darkening there
With a Wormwood mind
And a gullet of poison
Asked
He thought the court a farce
His tongue as sharp as glass
A bastard to the last
This truth assassin
tautened his claws at the ruinous cast
Flexing vexation at clerics aghast
In uproar he caused the cross to be masked
And the hex of exile from God's Kingdom passed
Back in the mirror shattered vanity died
The curse even clearer on the sanity side
Banished from the lavish tracts of paradise
From Heaven's shored poured to the sore divide
The moon was black
Devil may care
Their thunder sundered all his veils
Thickening there
His beligerent pulse
To a sickening crawl
Yes
He'd fostered wickedness
Fed vipers at his breast
Inflicted death's caress
So now to suffer
He'd burn discern
That his second turn
Would last for eternity
In reckoning flames
O'er a rainbow of black magic scars
Deep in the sleep of this heretic barred
The nightmares were livid occultist depraved
His epiphany struggled to come
But dawn found him there redemptive prepared
Like Christ to Golgotha his face to the sun
All fears were smeared
When Joan had appeared
In a shower of tears
Last vestige of innocence
Yearning for her vision of divinity
Of her miracles and dreamt lyrical deeds
He would meet her at the pyre as the fire kissed
Devil may care
He awed the court with a sworn confession
Quickening there
His radiant death
And acute renewal
Thus
The end was glorious
He went like Jesus trussed
To shadow and to dust
At the stroke of seven
And
With thieves at both his hands
The Reaper of these lands
Wept with holy plans
As he choked to heaven
I am redeemable and I believe
The clemencies of God
And suffrages of the Holy Church
Have succoured me with much mercy
I have only ever wished to satisfy my desires
Worming through the mark
Of Ezekiel and Mark
Through the chapters of Honorius
Gilles as in a trance
Screwed the pages up and danced
Courting something vainly glorious
He walked he gravest night
That decrepit final juncture
Of doom and negativity
Reeking of death
And the gloom of Stygian light
When suddenly the faintest whisper
A curtain opened in a painted vista
Moonbeams swept into his dream
Balsamic and anathema
Balsamic and anathema
Prelati full of stars
Magical ecstatic stars
That sparkled no debacle sought to douse
His fiery omnipresence
Hissed at heaven evanescent
He was there to thwart the burning of his Faust
The gates were prised the phantom horses
Snorted restless to be gone
With enchantment's eyes upon the door he cried
'Come with me now'
Gilles balked the thought of life
Accused and pursued
And overridden by morbidity
Saddened his breath
For those destined for his knife
Then suddenly  the strangest feeling
One that left the angels reeling
Atonement crept into his midst
Balsamic and anathema
Balsamic and anathema
Prelati full of stars
This abductor of his heart
Promised him horizons free of pain
But all the grand designs
Magic signs and midnight wines
He would stay and face his slayers
Cardinals and courtroom players
Whilst Prelati must now flee before
The pure and azure dawn
The gates were wide the phantom horses
Snorted restless to be gone
With enchantment's eyes upon the door
Once more he cried
'Come with me now'
Prelati full of stars
Tried to pull him from the dance
Summoning his Barron to perform
But as the Demon rose
In sweet miracles of prose
And propaganda came a proper bible storm
Lightning  grinning froze
On this murdersite of crows
And from the scattered ashes stepped a sylph
The maiden Joan of Arc
Crept more beautiful and dark
A paradise a cradle free of filth
She was chaste beyond all graces
The face of faith illuminated
More precious than Prelati's spell
A Goddess in a dream
And trembling in her arm
Her eyes a thousand golden psalms
That glittered as on Christmas night
He wept like Hallowe'en
He held the scene the poignant gleam
Of peace and great serenity
Close to his heart her parting kiss
He slept to wake released in bliss
Years of plead behind the walls
Chambers and vaults Scenes of fright
Unspoken Words in pain and dread
140 lives passed his hands
Gilles De Ray's
The perverted son
The holy man
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Alluring children for his masses
Robbing and buying young souls
Sacrifice to morbid demons
Satisfy his repulsive sexual lust
Gilles De Ray's
The perverted son
The holy man
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
So this is for the morbid one
The braveless and sick
Shivering laughter shrilled through the tombs
Sexual offence and perverted rites
Watching them limp and die
Wizards and darkness Gilles' dreams
Halfway came true
As a late medieval's French marshall
Unrestrained with endless ambitions
Personal guard for Jeanne D'Arc
the rising of his soul to god
Gilles De Ray's
The perverted son
The holy man
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Overdone Mystism and
Desperate Satanism
Are just one small step apart
There's no human scheme in the beyond
Laced with lines from the end of time
From the herald and the bugler
High voltage bolts the cellar door
Switch thrown at midnight's peak
To start the heart of a scarlet whore
Gauged infernally
A poetess in night's profane station
Threading lies like silver seas
A seamstress for an amputee nation
Wedded to depravities
Devil to the metal
Devil to the metal
Diluting the authority of life with sewer brine
Laced with grime from the spiral of time
Wherein spins cruel order
The big hand strokes the Little Horn
Not thrown for charity
To win the sins of the decadent born
To wage eternally
Passion rides the great unholy
Ipsissimus of love's despair
Her ashen grin would shine if only
Death would not sit smiling there
Her beauty freezes reason
Like Helen at the reins
Of the rampant horse Apocalypse
On t he shore that it was made
Devil to the metal
DEVIL TO THE METAL
She fucks at unknown angles
Bleeds her victims to the bone
And in their guts untangled
Casts her runic eyes of stone
She will violate the future
Annihilate the past
Paving way in butcher trades
The red brick road through mankind's arse
Abandon reason life the veil
Darker seasons are released
Storm crows gather in black masses at the pane
Go to sleep beyond the pale
She is set to murder peace
Rome Jerusalem and Mecca are aflame
Dripping with the ripples of concern
Tear them from the stars I start to burn'
The big hand strokes the Little Horn
Not thrown for charity
To win the sins of the decadent born
To wage eternally
A poetess in night's profane station
Threading lies like silver seas
A seam stress for an amputee nation
Wedded to depravities
Devil to the metal
Devil to the metal
Devil to the METAL
Wishing in contempt of love
The righteous came to burn our forest
With hissing firebrands
For though we serve the gentle curves
Of our serpentgirdled Eastern Goddess
They thought they caught us
Kissing hearses in their land
Send away the pumpkin carriage
Blind mice in your head
Parade themselves like sacrilegious
Envoys of the dead
For in this house of the dark Madonna
Flesh will pleasure life
For free of sin we would dishonour
All that virgin sacrifice
Gut our city slaughter all within
Save the gold that goes to God
Show no pity for we worship sin
Spare not the old nor lightning rod
We raise our devil horns
To those who sit on high
For down amidst the thorns
We lie
Tonight the black guards came to rape
And ruin those souls empathising
With fleeing far away
Thrown to the Tigris river curves
Of our star tiaraed Ishtar rising
They thought they caught us
Courting Baphome t
Courting Baphomet
Gut our city slaughter all within
Save the gold that goes to God
Show no pity for we worship sin
Spare not the old nor lightning rod
She walked the world
When the world was made to dress
In a perfect darkness
A murderess in flame
Nature curled unleashed unfurled
The crack of a whip on the lips of anger
Why would your holy order
Not be wholly slain
Wishing in contempt of love
The righteous came to burn our forest
With just verses for the damned
For though we serve the gentle curves
Of our serpentgirdled Eastern Goddess
They thought they caught us
Pissing curses in the sand
We raise our devil horns
To those who sit on high
For down amidst the thorns
We lie
We raise our devil horns
So I shall conjure thee
demons of the Netherworld
For your names and seals are known
Evil
Slimy essence of corruption
Lord of Vice and Pestilence
Deity of Silent
Hear my words
Where will you be they tense for warfare
What will you see with your innocence there
Where will you be they tense for warfare
What will you see with your innocence there
Where will you be when God is glorifying
There we will be between the dead and dying
Where will you be when God is glorifying
There we will be between the dead and dying
Hear my words
Horaeus of Lion shape tailed with a serpent
Commander of the forces of Time and Space
Demon of Astrology
You shall arise
Beelzebub
Hideous of Aspect
_____ and Barron
Messengers of mean importance
Heed the power of my dark commands
Devoted to the votive holy standard above
'By command of the king of Heaven'
Came the death of Love
Where will you be when they're vilifying
How will they see when the truth is blinding
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they're vilifying
Where will you be when the dark is rising
How will you keep from it's terrorizing
Where will you be when the dark is rising
How will you keep from it's terrorizing
Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
But visions and ambition
Never listened to submission
And she was on a mission from the highest above
The death
The death of Love
The righteous death of love
For my ardour and my sensual delectation
I took a great number of precious little souls
Whom I killed and caused to be killed
Well it is to desire to be quit of this world 
In which there is nothing but misery
and then a golden flash like the onset of heaven
leaving her screams breaking my heart
and in the grip of fire
i knew the Death of love
Where will you be they tense for warfare
What will you see with your innocence there
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be they tense for warfare
Where will you be when God is glorifying
There we will be between the dead and dying
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when God is glorifying
Prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain
Devoted to the votive holy standard above
'By command of the king of Heaven'
Came the death of love
Where will you be when they're vilifying
How will they see when the truth is blinding
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they're vilifying
Where will you be when the dark is rising
How will you keep from it's terrorizing
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when the dark is rising
Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
But visions and ambition
Never listened to submission
And she was on a mission from the highest above
To Lord upon the slaughter
Like a sword through hissing water
She arose where archers sought her
For the death of love
The righteous death of love
Gilles adored her drama
Her suit of pure white armour
Blazed against the English in a torrent of light
And as they rallied onto night
A cancer fled his soul
Dissolving
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame a Valkyrie
She made him click without desire
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when they caught her breath
Her words would leave a scar
'For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars'
How will you know if the sky is burning
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when Babel builds my fire
Will you not flee and label me pariah
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they light my pyre
Aligned with Joan in all
That was enthroned and divine
He swore to score the crimes
Jackdaws poured on this dove
Crimes he knew alone
Derived from minds of the blind
The church unfurled for murder perched
Upon the death of love
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame a Valkyrie
She claimed the skies were lit with spires
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when she fought for breath
Her words would leave a scar
'For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars'
When Joan was burnt
He knew malevolence
At the heart of all
A cold and jagged abyss bled of sense
The throne he earned
Through God's benevolence
Started his own fall
Clothing ragged dogma in his own magnificence
Here the stench the gold events
The bold inventions of the will
Every wanton bent desire went fulfilled
A Daemon sat upon the top of the world
Like a Herod over Genesis
They sang hosannas as his banners unfurled
Kissing terrors with paralysis
His brash canvas insulted the view
moving heaven and earth to please the
Tumultitudes whom his strange retinue drew
To assert the thirteenth Caesar
The thirteenth Caesar
Ichor kicked inside his veins
The thirteenth Caesar
War was licked for shame
The thirteenth Caesar
Sicker but just as vain
The thirteenth Caesar
Gilles De Rais
When Joan was burnt
He knew malevolence
At the heart of all
He swore henceforth he would serve evil alone
Here the stench the gold events
The insurrection of his will
Theatre and feasts past the ken of mortal men
Every wanton bent desire went fulfilled
A Daemon sat upon the top of the world
Like a Herod over genesis
They sang hosannas as his banners unfurled
Striking terror intro menaces
The thirteenth Caesar
Ichor kicked inside his veins
The thirteenth Caesar
War was licked for shame
The thirteenth Caesar
Sicker but just as vain
The thirteenth Caesar
Gilles De Rais
Suetonius and Ovid
Filled the moonstruck dreams
With the purple of Rome
His Venus of arenablood was dead
And he was storming home
The thirteenth Caesar
Ichor kicked inside his veins
The thirteenth Caesar
War was licked for shame
The thirteenth Caesar
Sicker but just as vain
The thirteenth Caesar
Gilles De Rais
Carrion my name
For those who choose to mouth the curse
A tragic serenade
With Judas in my stride
The gothic halls of shame
Where statues coldly hold no worse
Than the murders I reclaim
From a dark forsaken time
Kissing heavenspent
He wipes lips free of his hectic discharge
Wishing to repent
For the brute that ravaged free
In slight hands beauty weeps
Conquest's deep methodical screwing
Hurt repeatedly
Like the world wound at his feet
Dirge Inferno
As it is written damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
The past at last has come
A savage bite without respite
Pervades the freezing air
This winter chill grist for his mill
If tears of joy will blear elsewhere
And church bells drown in the cracks of doom
The storms above us hew
As lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
Deflowering two by two
Hissing malcontent
He storms the skies on electric dis charge
Pissing in contempt
On the effigies of the weak
Killing all resolve
The great beast simmers his scarlet women
Spit their vitriol
On the terrified face of peace
Dirge Inferno
As it is written damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
Our past at last has come
A hellbound heart the rose and thorn
Have locked to hasten blood
The moon disrobes to harden droves
Of legions pouring
These rivers press his breath adorns
Senates and enemy seats
Whilst his power takes as ingratitude
The writhing of the weak
Wormwood my name
The poisoned star that fell to earth
And blistered free of shame
In the pits of selfrebirth
Now those caves become a garret
Overseeing endless barracks
As the waters turn to claret
And the Vatican satins burn
Dusk and her embrace
When the sun has swept upon the waveless lake
And the mists steal in with ease
Covened wolves arc their eerie dissonant napes
In adoration of the moon and thee
They call as I to thee
And I will come as if in dream
My languid dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen
Of vengeful ancient breed
Gilded with the pelts of many enemies
Erishkigal ravenhaired
I can taste thy scent by candlelight
Legs of porcelain traced and laced to their lair
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Lo The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and fever demise
Through twilight darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone
Countess swathed in ebony
And snowwhite balletic grace
Rougefilmed lips procure the wish
For lust and her disgrace
Dusk and her embrace
We shall flit through the shadows
Like a dream of werewolves in the snow
Under deady nightshade
Still warmed with the kills of afterglow
Beneath the stars thy flesh bedevils me
Beneath the stars taste the death in me
Bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
To sever thin mortality
Elizabeth
My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words
Warm within like wine
Let me come to thee
with eyes like Asphodel
Moonglacing loose desires free
To writhe under my spell
Erishkigal ravenhaired
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
How the full embosomed fog
Imparts the night to us
At the age of sixteen
I grew out of hope
I regarded the cosmos
Through a circle of rope
So I threw out my plans
Ran on to the wheel
And emptied my head
Of all childish ideals
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
I married the first girl
Who wasn't a man
And smiled as the spiders
Ran all over my hands
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
Made a good living
By dying it's true
As the world in my TV
Leaked onto my shoes
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
Waiting to be born again
Wanting the saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away
Nothing is what I feel
Waiting for the drugs to make it real
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away
Waiting to be disciplined
Aching for your nails across my skin
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away
Telepath Carbon trapped under stone
Brother mother pale body is thrown
Only way I know to have fun
Fill up my blood my veins my lungs
ESP city  rainy and blue
Burn down this town I give it to you
Aero shallow photograph blind
Stage fright black light coma divine
No sense of time
Sever tomorrow
Exitless mind  ESP Sever tomorrow
School out invective losing my voice
Film shredding on in multiple choice
America calls I must go
Oprah saviour I feel that low
Modem load and failsafe
Electric teenage dust
Hit the solvent keypad
Start the neural rust
Power on the highway
Data in my head
Surfing on the network
Part of me is dead
Every Home is Wired
Swimming in the circuit
Somebody has expired
This world will be the future
Every home is wired
Inside the vehicle the cold is extreme
Smoke in my throat kicks me out of my dream
I try to relax but its warmer outside
I fail to connect it's a tragic divide
This has become a full time career
To die young would take only 21 years
Gun down a school or blow up a car
The media circus will make you a star
Dark matter flowing out on to a tape
Is only as loud as the silence it breaks
Most things decay in a matter of days
The product is sold the memory fades
Crushed like a rose
In the river flow
I am I knowFamilies set apart
Woken up with a start
Like a scream in the night
The sound of a fight
Singles or couples
Seized like animals
Fugitives were shot
Killed on the spot
Invading enemies
Conquered territories
Military Breakthrough
On the run for freedom
Hiding for survival
Concentration camp
Guarding watch tramp
Packed out shacks
Only the strongest survive
Days and night in a cage
Locked and exploited
The destiny of a slave
Massive internment
Rude confinement
Broken up families
Piled up dead bodies
We belong to our families
 so does our blood
And for them we would shed it
Without a moment's hesitation
Gathering our 2 lines
Was a success thanks to
The maturity and
Respect of our elders
It's been 65 years
That our bloods were blended
And our families grow
Larger and stronger
Year after year
When the little Iano
Was brought in the world
The alliance was forged
We all have the same roots
And the same origins
Their source lies in the blood
Red like vengeance and the
Honor of our fathers
By hearing our music
The ones who know us know
Who are the leaders
And they know who beat time
Lu canto famigliare spargi
Violence e terrore pi li nostri nimici
Pace e calore pi li nostri amici
Fierta e onore pi nostri fratelli e sorelle
Born on an island
In the middle of nowhere
Our renown
Has now crossed the borders
And the name of the
Family is mentioned
With respect everywhere
Na nostra famiglia
Non' pardoniamo mai
Na nostra famiglia
Si vivi onoratamente
Na nostra famiglia
Non' naviemo pieta
Na nostra famiglia
Si vivi onoratamente
At home we don't talk because
Walls have ears and as
Our fathers used to say
A man who doesn't talk much
Is a man who knows
Na nostra famiglia
Seven days was all they wrote
I thought the field had clerared
Another suit challenged me
I have to make a choice
They're not bluffing this time
It's plain to see it's them or me
It makes me think
Seven days
Will quickly go
Seven days
So many ways
I can't run away
What they said keeps ringing in my head
I need some time
Need one more chance
Monday I could wait till
Tuesday If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
Does it bother me
Someone to talk to
When I get down
I won't run away
No place to run
No place to hide
I'm not blind
Though I know there's no way
To bring back yesterday
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Friday Saturday but Sunday'd be too late
Monday I could wait till
Tuesday If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
Does it bother me
I don't care about
What people say
I still believe in myself
I still go
My own way
I don't know if it's right or wrong
I just feel confused and
My thoughts go away
Spend my life looking for something
What it is I don't know Looking for happiness
I found sorrow This place must be hell
You gotta know the rules
I'm slowly losing my mind
I've suffered hard
Can't take the pain no more
I'm gonna break these chains
I've got bad things on my mind
Spent my time breaking rules
That's a fact I like to gamble
But this time I won't lose
Life's a struggle
Life's a game
I made it through the hard times
I got nothing left to lose
So many things I can't explain
Life's a bitch  then you die
Mysteries and secrets deep inside us
The last creation of an ancient kind
Nuclear testing under the sun
Black rain and death left behind
Mysteries and secrets deep inside us
The last creation of an ancient kind
Nuclear testing under the sun
Black rain and death left behind
Darkened skies darkened skies
And for the next generations
Life under darkened skies
Man's new doctrine
A fast and total destruction
Mysteries and secrets deep inside us
The last intrusion of the human kind
In the natural order
And life will disappear
Under our darkened skies
And for the next generations
Life under darkened skies
And for the next generations
Life under darkened skies
Blood will follow blood
But not in the name of god
Come my friend and you will see
What means for us family
Facing us no compromise
Between us no place for lies
Facing us you won't survive
Between us it's do or die
There's a time for life
And a thousand ways to die
The thing that makes us strong
We think and fight as one
Tears will follow tears
For old friends disappeared
Come my friend and you will see
What means for us unity
Full of love full of respect
For your bro your mom your dad
Always honest with your friends
With yourself from birth till death
Full of love full of respect
For your bro your mom your dad
Always honest with your friends
With yourself from birth till death
Che un' tempu' pi viviri e
Mille sorte pi murire
Cosa canni fannu' forti
E pinsare e cummattere
Come una Bella famiglia
Here I am I have nothing to prove
Right now there's nothing left to loose
My only desire is to stay with you
But my ego told me to kill you too
I am not afraid of the consequences
There's a conflict between me
And my conscience
I'm known as the sickest one around
The fuckin' mad one who can bring you down
But remember for ever I'm your friend
Even if forever means your own end
Cause like death I'm insane and unstable
And like poison I can be sweet but horrible
If your soul is as cold and dark as mine
So join me at the table
Confusion's in my veins
Eternal hate's by my side
Deeply blinded by pain
From me you cannot hide
You were born and raised to take care
Of the members
Of your family and lead them on the right way
Crossing your native land
You learned and understood
The meaning of honor
Now you are one of them because
Of blood and honor
And to hunt unworthy traitors
To found the rules of the family
Laws of honor and war
Major and minor and criminal too
Honor and war
Respect  love  honor  famiglia
Respect  love  honor  famiglia
We all live honourably in our family
Honor and respect are laws
And treason is not forgiven
Laws of blood and silence passed down
From father to son
 these are the laws of the family
Respect  love  honor  famiglia
Respect  love  honor  famiglia
Respect of values is essential
Show me the way to defeat my stronger enemy
Send me the power of hate
The demons of flesh
Your justice is done friendship is gone
This world is ruled by the gods of war
Angry eyes narrow minds
We're facing the beginning of
A new century with death in our eyes
Mankind is trapped in a nightmare of freedom
Entering darkness light left behind
We are the witnesses of the downfall of humanity
Angry eyes narrow minds
We're facing the beginning of
A new century with death in our eyes
Angels of pain demons of war
Angels of pain demons of war
The skies are crying the earth is bleeding
The tears of the god they loved
A tide of lies
Our last temple is a temple of flesh
Deep in our hearts
Where evil is waiting
Waiting for the demons of intolerance
Where evil is waiting
Waiting for the demons of intolerance
Cornered in the cold side of life
Trapped into this world of lies
The world's upside down
Dreams are falling to pieces
There's no more hope to be found
Searching the strength to resist
Sometimes the world's against me
You think you know what's good for me
I don't ask anything
I don't wanna be locked
For life in the cage you have set up for me
This time I turn
I keep my eyes wide open
You think you know what's good for me
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will stand
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will fight
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will stand
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will fight
I try  I learn  I live  I will make it
A new era has come
I'm the only master of my destiny
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will stand
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will fight
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will stand
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will fight
The melodies of your temptation
Such painful expectation
Suddenly flashed passion
I hide my secret in your dreams
Avoiding a solution I am afraid of a pain
The bleeding memoirs
And your words as a thorn in heart
The wounds are so deep
Like the rivers of despair
Invisible patterns on heart
Pictures of your reflections
I see them through my dreams
And I wake up for my pain
Somewhere there it is deep in heart
The melodies of your temptation
Such painful expectation
Suddenly flashed passion
Leave me your pain a pain to remember
Bitter consolation for my loneliness
So deep in heart rhymes of farewell words
You leave exempting me to feel it all again
The pain disappears but together with me
We separately die to feel it all again and again
The cold of a flame sting us
And we freeze
And we freeze in absurd sufferings
ItÃÂ´s our own tragedy
So strange for no one of us
But such bitter only for us
They any more do not warm
As we once
And we freeze in absurd sufferings
ItÃÂ´s our own tragedy
So strange for no one of us
But such bitter only for us
 only for us
Someone of us has put out this flame
Our reflections has gone
And you leave my hand
We donÃÂ´t want to remember we are dead
ItÃÂ´s our own
 by fiery stone down to the sky
Into the fog on a threshold of dawn
On lunar path in blindness
Obey the charms of my magical voice
To your deceits again
DonÃÂ´t let in because I am
Because I am coming to you
To your deceits again
Alone with your reflections
I confess you in eternity
Wait for at the edge of time
IÃÂ´ll return for with the last star gone out
The heavenly wine has been shed
No one cries anymore
Only bitter honey on your lips
And your deceits again
 by fiery stone down to the sky
Into the fog on a threshold of dawn
On lunar path in blindness
Obey the charms of my magical voice
To your deceits again
DonÃÂ´t let in because I am
Because I am coming to you
To your deceits again
Alone with your reflections
I confess you in eternity
Wait for at the edge of time
IÃÂ´ll return for with the last star gone out
It corrodes from within burns me
It poisons from within destroys me
It cripples from within enslaving me
It incinerates from within burying me
There is too much for me
Everything is in your words
There is too much for pain
Everything is in your eyes
 leave me alone
 if you can
Leave me if you can
I have no forces
Leave me if you can
Allow me to die in loneliness
Erase all inside of me
Lay your hand on my eyes
Close the sun from me
 from illusions and jealousy
 for ever
The darkness creeps into my eyes
Am I alive No IÃÂ´m just without heart
Illusions There is my rest forever
Jealousy In despair I am left
Eyes are close hands are lowered
Words are said the life is lived
ItÃÂ´s never to return IÃÂ´ll try to forget
IÃÂ´ll allow you to come only in my dream
Leave me if you can
I have no forces
Leave me if you can
Allow me to die
Leave me if you can
Plead leave me if you can
You can see me with closed eyes
You can feel me with your skin
Your every night has approaching my rapture
And your grief burns in my every word
Cry weÃÂ´ll never to touch each other because
Because IÃÂ´m inside of you
Cry you suffer from my eternity
I am your bitter cold solitude
IÃÂ´m in your lives with confession
IÃÂ´m with you suffer from frankness
And something torments inside your soul
You can forget your life if itÃÂ´s not me
Cry weÃÂ´ll never to touch each other because
Because IÃÂ´m inside of you
Cry you suffer from my eternity
I am your bitter cold solitude
You can see IÃÂ´m in you
You can feel IÃÂ´m with you
Because IÃÂ´m inside of you
I am your cold solitude
Whispering IÃÂ´m leaving for ever
Emptiness is closing your eyes
I can embrace your dream with your illusions
And for the morning you will not wake up
Cry weÃÂ´ll never to touch each other because
Because IÃÂ´m inside of you
Cry you suffer from my eternity
I am your bitter cold solitude
Hold it your hands such cold and severe
Shadow the unique gift from you
I press to heart I feel nothing
And with every beat
You leave me with every suffering
 the unique gift from you
I press to heart I feel nothing
And with every breath
 with every suffering
You nothing to recollect I always waited
So it is far from light I am cold it is hurt me
It will return again I shall wait
I shall be ready to leave forever
Stare I donÃÂ´t believe I am in your hands
My heart is in your hands I am in your
Shadow the unique gift from you
I press to heart I feel nothing
And with every breath
 with every suffering
IÃÂ´ve never burnt my heart
IÃÂ´ve never met a dawn with tears
IÃÂ´ve never felt pains up to you
Honey for my wounds
Temptation is so cruel
I touch your shadow I wake up
IÃÂ´ve never been afraid of lonely nights
Honey for my wounds
Let your words to warm
Let your eyes to bewitch
Let your breath become mine
Honey for my wounds
Can you read my dreams
Can you share my loneliness
Let your lips becomes my honey
Honey for my wounds
WeÃÂ´re
Going to believe but we are dreaming now
DonÃÂ´t let anything to disturb your wounds
It is just a dream
Cease nothing else
This sun does not warm
 of your sweet
There is nothing surprising
 her cold embraces
She touches my palm
Like itÃÂ´s a snow recovered me
She is daring embracing stones
Inhaling the passion
By her temptation
No I donÃÂ´t trust in her sorcery
My heart is beating in these stones
My heart is bleeding in your sores
IÃÂ´m only a sunset filled by melancholy
Engraved in her delight
 my name
My heart is beating in these stones
My heart is bleeding in your sores
Recover meI want you
To hear the cry
Throughout the night
We know what it means
The new is old
And red is white
The law they preach
Ain't what it seems
I want you
To hear the noise
We'll take the world
And gonna shout and scream
Celebration
Destination
Celebration
Of your life
He was standin' at the big loadin
When all the trucks and buses rolled up
Dirty jeans and a leather jacket
Full of patches of all those heavy bands
He wasn't very hard to talk to
And looked like he had nowhere to go
Easy easy rocker
Always on the run
Easy easy rocker
Together we'll be strong
Now the stage is a white burnin'fire
And the planet is ready to explode
The music is new and the music is hot
And we all came here for the magic ride
The scream of eternal life
Runs through every icecold soul tonight
Now the seats and the streets and the bars
Are runnin'empty
But the sounds and the songs and the lights
Still splash your brain
I can see in your eyes what you need
And I just call you
You know crazy nelly
She's crossed eyed and dumb
She's dirty and she's smelly
But she's got a lovely bum
Her hair is bloody grotty
Her breath stinks like the pest
Her skin is dry and spotty
But her arse is just the best
She's gettin'easy money
And welfare from the state
Oohsmelly nellyyou're so divine
Oohsmelly nellybaby be mine
Her body's fat and flabby
Her rotten teeth just stink
Her clothes are torn and shabby
But her lips are nice and pink
Her nickers are encrusted
With shit and bugs and lice
This face is bruised and busted
But her arse is paradise
She's gettin'easy money
And welfare from the state
Mr sixty nine has suddenly come to rest
He died on the job that he did best
Oh you lucky angels
Heaven will be fine
Havin'lots of fun with Mrsixty nine
Take carehe's hot
Take carehe's cool
Bewarelittle angels
Bewarehere he comes
Mrsixty nine sweet sixty nine
Mrsixty nine Mrsixty nine
It's a bad joke the way in which he died
He did choke on a lady's sanitary pad
Oh you lucky angels heaven will be fine
Havin'lots offun with Mrsixty nine
I can see by your eyes what you need
I'll be out of your life
I may get depressed cause I tried so hard
To be somethin'special for you
Words of love that are still in my ears
Days when I kissed your tears
Long crazy nights spilling into days
Times when I lost my fears
She's got everything I need
And it's drivin' me insane
She's got everything I need
Makes me smile and makes me weep
Love needs a heart and I need to find
If I was treatin'you right
Angels and sailors rich girls and us
Are searchin'for true love tonight
In a restaurant
Drinkin' beaujolais wine
You're with your favourite girl
And you're passin'the time
Well you look through the papers
Holocaust in the roxy
Five hours later
You're lovin'your lady
I can see
Burnin'bones of war
I can see
Ashes on the floor
There stands a soldier
In a barbedwire land
The fear of death in his eyes
And a bottle in his hand
But now the wine he's drinkin'
It's got the taste of blood
No more plastic war movies
To show him what it's like
You give me money
You give me lovin'
Sweet satisfaction
Of the first degree
You never need me
When I'm away
'Cause there's somebody
For you to play
So close your eyes
And stay with me
In rock city
And ease your worried mind
In rock city
I love the lies
It tells your story
Your dirty pictures
Of the last six years
Your life is backstage
Where the joint is rockin'
And there you're the sweetest queen
Of all the girls so shockin'
Well you give me all your money
And you give me all your love
The sweetest satisfaction
Yes it's all in first degree
But whenever I'm away
You always find somebody else
Dirty pictures tell the lies
You've lived the last six years
Backstageyou're rockin'
Backstageyou're shockin'
I've been waitin'for so long
Gettin'had and treated wrong
Sleepless nights and dirty lies
Makes no difference if you live or die
But it's over now
I'm a winning man
'Cause babe
I live my life the way I choose
Satisified not much to loose
If you don't feel you'll never know
Just what I've been goin'thru'for so long
Mother's got a lover half as old as she
Father's got a gamblin'house in capri
Sister sue's a junkie dope and LSD
Sells her arse to the arabs while others
Get it free
So I'm the black sheep
The only hang up I've got
Is an old guitar
And a cat named lisalott
Mad racketyou've got it
Mad racketyou've got it
Women's undergarments are simon's bag
He's a transvestite he's a fag
Auntie ann is a schizo crazy as they come
She thinks she is a chicken stickin'feathers
In her bum
So I'm the black sheep
The only hang up I've got
Is an old guitar
And this is not a curse
At least not by the hands of another
Your refuse
Will fertilize
Your own children
And the tunnel is burrowed eternally
As time digests itself
It worms through the path
And is excreted
As time digests itself
Gargantuan malformation
Worms through the path
And is excreted
When the truth won't do
And lies are so fulfilling
Hollow words
Beget hollow gestures
Hollow gestures
Beget hollow ventures
This impulse that dictates our nature
Drives us to dysfunction
Belligerent apathy
Belligerent apathy
Belligerent apathy would suit us so much better
But our motives are too impure
Reflection
Is but a stranger
These strings set rigorous routine
Cracks form covering my body
Weakened blistered and torn apart
Revisiting old wounds
Completing the circle
Once again
Swollen eyes fixed on the prize
We hang our heads in selfdestructive triumph
These fault lines
A soul erosion
Predictions never became so clear
Disillusioned with complacence
We craft our past
Peering down this tunnel ever so far
Cracks shed light
Another day fails the shadow
One by one another chapter closes
Nostalgic echo
Perpetually reverberates
In the teeth of all experience
We still stand
Immersed in reflection
Memories linger and cling like dirt
The yearning increased at
Exponential rates
But you wanted no part
Mortally content
Until the surge gave shock
And got you on all fours
Interface fucked
Inside a cubicle that looks of detachment
Is it the size or the angle the point is clear
The mortal erection has run out of skin
We're hooked on electric stimuli
Wandering lost
In a place of disillusionment
Gives way to glacial edifice
Narrow spaces with towering frigid walls
Monolithic blocks of ice
Stacked to the sky
Reflective surfaces
Confuse
And obscure all
Boundaries
Is it over
Has it begun
But when the balance is
Disrupted
The iceblocks will
Rain down
Derange the scale of trust
With this animated prevarication
That once passed for happiness
Degenerate into character
The clearest of all intentions
Words drawn out
Unfiltered
A perception
Untainted by logic
We are such low things
With null for a name
And while we quietly become
Imperceptible
We are such low things
With null for a name
The inner monologue exposed
But this curtain is drawn closed
Ships of oblivion
Fall from the sky
The leaves are fallen angels trying
To remember how to fly
I've spent my whole life trying to understand
Why the tree of life is dead
And I finally reached the answer
Its shadow had nothing else to shade
But a portrait of pain
Withered leaves
With their remains they paint the world
This autumn will live forever
Through my song and through my words
There's a stranger in the mirror
But I can recognize the chain
That keeps me nailed to the canvas
Of a portrait of pain
This is the season
When God will become an atheist
This is the reason
Why the fire will quench the thirst
I'm the shadow who didn't have a tree
I'm the shadow who didn't have a Sun
Being more than the eye could ever see
I'm the shadow who shades within me
A portrait of pain
And before you die
Just remember this my friend
There's no noisy end
Silently you'll say Good Bye
Still between you lips
I know there is a silent shout
There are words about
Your personal apocalypse
Rain of fire baby
Rain of fire
Falling down deep into your head
Rain of fire baby
Rain of fire
A silent candle to watch your final end
For the longest sleep
The fire will be your only shroud
Tears won't be allowed
There's no point for you to weep
In the final scene
Of this drama puppets show
You won't even know
Why you burn and what's your sin
A fallen soul doomed to fail
A broken wing a shining scale
The guardian the keeper
Of the secret signs
A crawling been hiding into a hole
The serpent of brass put upon a pole
Immortal The symbol
Of the underworld
The memories of the Snake
An endless battle it never forsakes
The beast coiled around the Sun
Is the weapon of the Pharaoh's crown
Biting its tail shedding its skin
The heart is cold but it burns within
The cycle The symbol
Of eternity
Strained you hear the silent roar
Right before the storm
Your ears are deaf
But the sound is jabbed
Deep into your mind
Deep into your mind
Wait for something to come
But you can't see a soul
Like a prey you feel
The raptors' breath
You can feel that your end is near
Strained you wait to meet your doom
You have no time to shed a tear
On your skin the blood in bloom
Fear coiled in your heart
Like a starving worm
You can't see the Death
Coming in your way
On my knees
I kiss the ground and pray
To defeat my enemies today
For this I spill a drop of blood
A small gift for all my pagan gods
Help me crush
The ramparts down and be
The last thing that my enemies will see
For this I spill a drop of blood
A small gift for all my pagan gods
I'm pagan and proud
Let me shout it loud
I'm pagan and proud
Let me shout it loud
And if I die
Let it be on the battlefield
Let the others carry me back on my shield
Then let me burn and help me fly
Give me a star up in the sky
Fear is the weapon
Against all those
Who bow their heads
What about your own choice
What if you'll raise your voice
What do you have to loose
The silence is no excuse
The blind follow the blind
And no one expects there is something to find
A thief in the country of fools
Is a powerful king who makes his own rules
Deny denial
The hell was full so I came back
I fought my way until I found a crack
Through your mind and through your soul
I am the name that you are afraid to call
A shadow coiled deep in your mind
I am still one of a kind
The fear made them hate my name
So this is how I became
The lord of flies
I can't forget what I used to be
How the people worshiped the soil fertility
Even if a new religion threw me straight to hell
I know that I'll always be the Zebul Beel
When I come down in the arena
I know I fulfill a sacred act
The bravery of fighting the beasts
Turns my death into a feast
Gladiators spill the blood
For the glory of their God
For the last time we see the sky
We who are about to die
When the metal meets the flesh
I defy death
With my shield or on my shield
I'll finally meet the Elisian Field
In death
The only fear that I know
Is to lay down dead by the end of the show
But if it happens I'll keep my breath
'Cause Pollice verso means my death
Any moment could be the last
There is no future there is no past
My fading breath is all that I feel
The end is near the end is real
Between the walls of a golden palace
That came out like a bud from the desert sand
The poet of the court glorifies the deeds
Of the sultan who rules over that wasted land
A caravan of words threads before his eyes
But a distant whisper breaks his dream
Could be the wind Could be just a lie
Slowly the whisper turns into scream
And the wind keeps on calling his name
And the desert drives him insane
Arabia An endless land
Where there is no boundary
Between dreams and reality
Realm of sand
Where the mirage floats in the air
Turning the hope into despair
The words so plain seem to draw a shape
That soon becomes crystal clear
A girlish pale face black diamonds as her eyes
Suddenly decides to go and meet his love
Through those deceptive desert sands
He walks she runs He runs she disappears
Deep into the desert Where he'll find his end
Take two coins and put them
Upon your eyes
Then be ready for the final journey
Far away from the promised sky
You suffered hard you suffered well
Behind a happy mask your tears can tell
That I'm right when I say
The life is hard and after that you pass away
Do you think that dying
Is ending the strife
Hm Then you must prepare yourself
For another slice of life
'Cause everything is on its way to something
In the afterlife this is what you'll see
You wait for your death with an infinite emotion
But even dead you'll never cease to be
In motion
The sleepless soul of decorum
Leave my body in anachronism
I will fade away
Radiant opium elevation
Won't be my sommertimes
Take the deam lead me
Own my inside be my shelter
End this moment of infinity
Out stretched arms lay down next to me
As telltale winds stand pail
Morphic ocean
In my mirror halls
The mellow rhythm of slaw rainfall
Hammer my pure splitted foam
Chrome wings of goldenfish paraded
Creep on the horizon
Boil condensed liquid
Around walls of corridors
Dry up my carapace
Anathematized amphora
Wich sinner could go to paradise
Who could fly with no wings
Who could live with mankind without a tear
I'm the paradise sinner
I could fly with no wings
Let me spleen
Allright

Le fruit de tes bras s'estompe
Je dessine ton visage sur la glaise tendre
Et paufine ton image ÃÂÃÂ  coup d'offences
EtayÃÂÃÂ© par le vent
Au prÃÂÃÂ¨s de l'orage

DÃÂÃÂ©chainÃÂÃÂ© par l'orage

Pullulant de flocons ruisselant sur mon front
Your face on clay
Engravers point at heart
Fine coating of boiled milk

Embellish my draft lips

La dÃÂÃÂ©miurge she breaks me down
Your face on a clay
Fine coating of boiled milk
Your face on a clay
Engravers point on heart
The demiurge breaks me down
My soul
My soul is black like a bird
Lies raven priceless
Ahead to mediatic crosses
Engulfed spirally's crown
Engulfed lustfull desire
Darkness
Abyssic cliches
None habits gather my churches
I am not the trembler
Become my serpent slaved to blissful promises
Just a point in this deep purple cover
Absorbed blood on my back shows
Black at heart
Bindweed at heart
I'm black at heart
Numb opacity
Guises misled
Forsake me humanity
Crushed by wither away
Torn apart
Doors opened valley
Falls into devoid glams
Numb opacity
Guises misled
Of black I'm covered
Silently I scream loveless
Of black I'm covered
Silently I scream loveless
Plans passed as steamy vast pointless
Just one second
I wanna be
I wanna be a momentbody
Release me
A momentbody
I wanna be
Release me
Momentbody
Where seven impaled widows shine under my semen
 Why are you worshipping a human genocide
 I'm watching the downfall
My sex on on cold marble
Licking tears of mankind's cry 
I didn't stop I just stole
And speaking hot
Of my corporal punishment
 Hey see it later 
 Death mas mine thank you
 Talk to me my pleasure
Are you smoking to forget
 Oblivion
Always the utter sorrow
Last hope  last love
 Something I can hate for you
You're more alive
 I forgot to appreciate life
It's too late for me
 No no no no
This is life
Right here
Noooo This is life
Right here
Right now
Take it
Globe my breast
Let you be Atlas
My ever ending spere
Oh please
 Thank for being the one bit of light
In an ever darken dream
Ever darken dream
 I wanna know
 I don't believe you 
 I wanna know 
 Shark nacle of blood
For how long I praise
The beauty of the aquatic city
I am dead for 23 years now
Hell is right 
 Who was the murderer 
 I was sure
I am a monolith
Sect of our heart
My belief in religion
Rise high in the sky
Own preacher
Hatetress desires
Ruin my throne of celtic empire
Of celtic empire
Gold
Stones black and grey
Sculpt dark universe
Genocide
Holocaust
Empire of ethnocide
Holocaust
Empire of ethnocide
Heart as a monolith in ruins
Fly high  ride the northern winds
Turn ashes to immortality
Dark paradise in blue cyan sea
Be hater of mankind
Yiel the lament
Be hater of mankind
Toward the monolith
Toward the monolith
Emotional climate
Cleverness of purple blaze
Conquest your fidelity
Monolith throne of stone
Fly under my drug out of my body
Out of my body
Ouh
Teleportate through the flames of the sea
Reverse the process of sweet mother nature
From me Monolith comes my path
Comes my path
The lots bathed in sea
Cover the world bath in the sea
Only an earth plot emmerge
Banished planet with no life ends
Sea create seeds
Pistil sprink salt water
Germinate in the air
As clouds pierced by babylon tower
Let the branches begin their cycle
Au bout de sa tige un bourgeon fleurit
Please praise the arrival in this virgin flore
Between the rock  sea
Rise the lotus high in the sky
Offer him a place to be
Snuffle the smell of the oxygen
The lotus flower's growing
See reaction of its self destruction
My self destruction
Oh no more life
Pushing a third of its power
Erased to the oath
Abyss point the seeds creation
Abyss point the seeds creations begin
It have to be worshipped for been the Abraham
Power splits the Earth
The lotus gives life  death
Of patel and it's the mighty one
Two parcels Freedom  harmony
Of patel it is the mighty one
Freedom is my thoughts of human being
The sea is the harmony
Lotus I will build your church
And my emotion is falling tears by tears
Through this marvelous perfume of creation
Pretending eyes behind your grin
Ethereal silence of the end
You fake your smile for your defense
For the lives we have to swallow
Makes it hard to be your friend
I try not to follow no no no no no
I'm in pain but I don't care
And it breaks your will to burn
Do you think to understand
We're bold as we still turn
Whoa
I think that I don't care
Whoa
I think that I don't care
So bite your tongue to save your sins
The lack of smile for you're the end
For the lives we have to swallow
Makes it hard to be your friend
I try not to follow no no no no no
I'm in pain but I don't care
And it breaks your will to burn
Do you think to understand
We're bold as we still turn
I'm in pain but I don't care
And it breaks your will to burn
FÃÂ
ck off
Youre nothing but a fickle fucker
Hah
I'm in pain but I don't care
And it breaks your will to burn
Do you think to understand
We're bold as we still turn
I'm in pain but I don't care don't care
Do you think to understand
Towards the system
Fight the system fight back
People die in police custody
Where's the justice in that don't see none
Fight the system fight back
We've been shit on far too long
There are no equalities no freedom
Fight the system fight back
Stand up fight for freedom
Stand up fight for your rights
Fight the system fight back
Government and queen are your only enemies
Don't be fooled by their plastic smiles
They don't wanna know your views of war
They never stop to think about you
They want you kept in the darkness of 
The realities of war
Meat flung yards apart from bodies
Are typical sights of war
Twisting words words for their own gain
Led up another garden path
Kept in darkness and fed on crap
It's a messed up fucked up fuckin' system
They're always there with their restrictions
Always there to put you down
Anarchy's the only solution now
It's a messed up fucked up fuckin' system
You take part in creating this system
That we all must suffer in
We can't stop going round and round
We got to fix this rat race
This is the system you helped to create
They use you for corruption schemes
You're the unrealized and unintended
You're the one the one they don't like
You let them know your fears
This is the system you helped to create
You ask me why I'm fighting the system
Why I'm preaching anarchy
I'm fighting for the freedom
This is the system you helped to create
Well you ass crawling bastards suck my arse
Religion Jesus Christ it's all a fucking farce
A stray bullet kills an innocent child
Nothing's gained and nothing's solved
Religion instigates this hate and war
A stray bullet kills an innocent child
Nothing's gained and nothing's solved
Hands are held
Within your hands
Every breath a gift
Laughter rings within your walls
A room they fill may silent fall
My sorrow is yours
Photographs
Adorn the wall
Where autumn sun
Long shadows cast
Memories of treasured times
Our burning hearts lock tears inside
My sorrow is yours
In the words of many I'm your saviour
In the words of many I am lies
In the words of many I walked blind
If you see me
Who am I
If you know me
Who am I
Did I conquer the grave can I save the lost
Or forever a figure carved and broken on a cross
From the eyes that drew you in
From confessions of our sins
My love
Don't turn away
From the beauty of our song
From the days we knew no wrong
My love
Don't turn away
From the ties within our hearts
From the world we've torn apart
My love
Don't turn away
From the arms that long for you
From the pathways we walked through
My love
Don't turn away
From the tears of pain and love
From the wars we rose above
My love
Don't turn away
From the hands now quivering
From these unseen golden rings
My love
Don't turn away
Many times you've laughed with me
Your smile stays with me
Lights the darkness that found me
In this emptiness
Til I walk with you again
Time is slow to heal this pain
Light is dimmer than before
Even though I'm seeing more
Beacons shine throughout the night
Even for you child of light
A passage to another shore
Distant friend and open door
Yours forevermore
My summer child
I remember you
Running through the leaves
And hiding behind trees
Now you wonder what is true
Don't you remember good things too
Another day slips away
In these times of separate lives
Mine is still calling out to you
Is there nothing I could do
Such a trial you've been through my child
So many paths
You will journey on
One day come find me
Upon this distant shore
I know you wonder what is true
And you remember good things too
Another day drifts away
You can stay and never question why
You may be afraid of nothing
You may wonder what horizons hide
And become a slave to yearning
No one can go
Where you must go
Find your way home
When you leave
And who knows where these summers go
How the winter comes so quickly
We can stay here as seasons ebb and flow
As we watch the endless flight of the free
No one can go
Where they must go
To find their way home
When they leave
I wish for you the very best
As selfish love I lay to rest
The years which you have given me
Brought me strength and liberty
The skies grew black with clouds of rain
The nights so long with no refrain
Where once was light and beauty here
Our days were darkening in fear
I long for her and for our love
I long to see blue skies above
My eyes are dim and weakening
No refuge in this world of sin
Down to my world came a shining star
Down in the deep where the darkness rolls
Where she illuminated night and day
She took my hand and I was born in flames
She came in storms that made the windows shake
Behind rain misted panes I'd look and wait
That night forever stays within my thoughts
Loved her from then until I breathe no more
And if this should be my last song to thee
Sing beside my grave
Shine your light on me
See the woods where we would walk in leaves
In our first autumn in the smoky air
Like a child I carved our names into a tree
And if this should be my last song to you
Walk beside my grave in the morning dew
Though my heart death has claimed
Let my words of love remain
It's no secret now everyone knows
It's my shoulder the night uses to cry
My bedroom with six hundred windows
My feet where the truth comes to die
Where the moon can't stop weeping
While the tide washes the prints in the sand
Your eyes that seek out new meaning
Your scared broken soul in my hands
This pulse that's been chained to you
Dandelions amidst lilies of snow
Someday I will see through your disguise
Someday pick my name from your lies
Till then I'll hide my soul in your book
And I'll yield to the flood of your innocence
With my cheap pleads and my sanity
And you may carry me down to the darkness
Wipe my slate with a flick of your wrist
Take this verse this accursed harness
It's yours now it's all that there is
It's no secret now everyone knows
It's my shoulder the night uses to die
My bedroom with six hundred windows
My feet where truth and hope die
As a drop of rain dries on my lips
And the wind rustles through my hair
As shadows chased by light
The sound of your voice has vanished
And the memories make my blood calcify
And they scar my own image
All alone
I try to walk away
Away from it all
But my own footsteps are hunting me
Night falls along with me
All alone
As a drop of rain dries on my lips
And the wind rustles through my hair
As shadows chased by light
Shadows
Chased
By light
They scar myself
They scar my own image
Make my skin crawl and whisper
And last breath he took made me feel all alone
So fucking alone
Fucking alone
I'm sure
Counting the lines around your mouth
A method precise
I make my careful unpenned notes reflect
The red rims around bloodshed irises
Your blotchet skin and cracked down lips
And now I will
Now shatter these fragments
They tell me my own sad stories
At night
They tell me my own stories
I'm sure
Counting the lines around your mouth
A method precise
Fragments
Now shatter these fragments
Shatter
I must have been
Written in pencil
Somewhere on your surface
The depths of you
Reserved for someone else
I lift and flake
And then Im gone
With one quick breath
Soft and bruised
I linger
Soft and bruised
And you are there
For all the world to see
My shell translucent
And you are there
For all the world to see
And you are there for all the world
The depths of you are now carved
Carving in my bones
The depths of you are now carved in my bones
On my surface
And you are there
For all the world to see
Carving in my bones

Heading out on an awesome night 
Looking good and Im feeling right
I grab my keys and Im on the road 
Pick up the guys now its time for the show
Cause its what makes us feel alive 
Forget the weekdays nows the time 
Lets be proud 
You're wasted shitfaced 
Everything seems fucking great 
Time flies you don't know why
Soon its time to say goodbye 
Walk home such a fucking mess 
But no remorse no fucking stress
The night consumed through a shot glass
Lets get fucked up
Lets be proud
With my life in one hand that is slipping away 
How did you think this would end 
The thorns in my chest are flaying my skin 
Writhing in pain I want to let go 
My torn insides make it impossible to breathe 
I dont need this I dont want this anymore
Say something you fuck say anything 
Youre going down with me 
Youd better not fucking disagree 
With my life in one hand that is slipping away 
How did you think this would end 
Say what you say 
Youll never be worthy of your integrity 
Get your shit together 
All the mistakes you have made in your life 
Are finally coming back to make things right 
Youve been so careless over the past 
Now its coming back to you 
All the mistakes you have made in your life 
Are finally coming back to make things right 
Youve been so careless over everything
This will no longer happen
I can hardly hear my breathing 
An adrenaline rush gushes through my throat 
I can hardly believe I've done this 
It was the right time no crying alone 
Forever secluded in my own self 
Hundreds of needles puncturing my skin 
Brutalized criticized mentally abused 
I can see them laughing right in front of me 
Compromised in my eyes you can feel my rage 
I can see the objects crush into their face 
Yeah But this is now 
I've got a plan and I'm laughing out loud 
This is fucking now 
I've been waiting for this moment so long 
After the bullshit all the gossip and jokes 
The way they look the way they look tonight 
Trying to put their entrails back inside 
Brutalized criticized mentally abused 
I can hear them laughing right in front of me 
Compromised in my eyes you can feel my rage 
I can see the objects crush into their face 
Merciless 
Beautiful people havent you heard 
The jokes on you Its revenge of the nerds 
Beautiful people havent you heard 
Now the jokes on you
I was walking through the darkness of my mind 
I discovered a place where I could find 
A side of me that would always be broken
 So I looked in the mirror 
I just saw it so clear 
Saw the eyes of a monster 
Finally faced my own fears 
I chased the shadows away 
Admitted what I really am 
I can feel it inside making its way out of me 
The dark passenger 
I discovered a place where I could find 
A side of me that would always be broken 
A side of me that would always be 
So I looked in the mirror 
My reflection appeared 
As what I really am 
As what I really feel 
I chased the shadows away 
Admitted what I really am 
I can feel it inside making its way out of me 
Making its way out of me
I see a disturbing face staring straight at me 
Cant say who the fuck it is or what it wants 
And it wont take its eyes off of me 
My body paralyzes my eyes just cannot open 
The fear invades me The blood rushes to my head 
I cant wake up I cant wake up 
Please stop staring at me looking at me 
I cant wake up please wake me up 
Please stop staring at me looking at me 
My body paralyzes my eyes just cannot open 
The Family 
Look around see all of us gathered 
Granted with the gift of pleasure
Draining our lungs into laughter 
Crushing the bones of a scorched bird 
Sweet blood gushing down my throat 
Life seems good life seems easy 
Damn not those who lay unfortunate 
Damn not those who live in hell 
Cherish the time we spend together 
Thy soul wont shine forever 
Listen to my voice listen to it close 
This is our feud of depravity 
Our last chance to immortality 
Our prose will prevail 
Life seems good life seems easy 
Damn not those who lay unfortunate 
Damn not those who live in hell 
A tear scars my face 
A scar that reminds us who we are 
A tear scars my face 
We are the ones that will shine
The blood is rushing up to my head 
I feel pissed off by the moment 
And its all because of you 
Because its true 
Cant go on like this much longer 
My weakness is growing stronger 
You know it cause its true 
So dont bother 
Go blame it on your father 
Go blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Its all because of you 
Blame it on your father 
Blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Its all because of you 
Your innocence has been lost 
Your sweetness is a lost cause 
You try to make me feel like its my fault 
Cant go on like this much longer 
My weakness is growing stronger 
You know it cause its true 
Youre cowardly disgusting 
For me you are just nothing 
You fake what you really are 
Dont bother 
Go blame it on your father 
Go blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Its all because of you 
Blame it on your father 
Blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Its all because of you because of you 
Dont bother 
Go blame it on your father 
Blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Oh tomorrow
And the wheel keeps turning in the skies
Never close your eyes before tomorrow
A new life a new love will find its way
So hold on child to what you've got
To your dreams your visions and your heart
Hold on child and wait until dawn
Because tomorrow is the seed of a new life
There's a light in the darkness
Oh tomorrow
And the wheel of fortune's turning round
Never close your eyes before tomorrow
Because the fire of love is still alight
So hold on child to what you've got
To your dreams your visions and your heart
Hold on child and wait until dawn
Because tomorrow sees the end of your night
Come as you are Lay your body next to mine
Your heart in my hands
May my love and my silence inspire your soul
Oh come as you are
Come as your are Death's not more but a dream 
that seems so unreal
Oh come as you are
No more tears to cry as the sea rolls on by
No more lonely nights 
Yet an angel stands by your side
Just come to me
The child and the man
The fool and the sage that you are
Oh come as you are
As the time has come for me to leave this world
How I longed to probe into the guarded mystery
I've seen the light in the dawning day
I've seen love  in a burning haze
I've tasted blood on your lips
Divine magenta  heavenly
No drug did take me higher than the scent of you
No fire be as fervent as your desire
Where ever you are where ever you roam
For you I sing the sweetest song
Salve Regina
Quae pervia caeli porta manes et stella maris
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra Salve
Ave Regina Caelorum
Ave Domina Daemonum
Salve Radix ex qua mundo lux est orta Decora
You call my name
You walk amongst the late
The seventh veil left at rainbow's end
Into the underworld Cerridwen's domain
Weep for the child inside gone from you
Died away No place in the upper world
But who will nourish our dreams
When laughter expires
To some a nightmare to some a dream
The wise woman takes the bone and points at me
Who am I to be
See my heart is in your hands
See my wings are broken
The fire starts to burn my flesh to the bone
Shall I dare or stay unconscious
Who'll be telling me wrong from right
As shadows fall like leaves in September wind
But when nightmares call we don't persist at all
Retrospective dreams collide 
stranded on that wasteland's shore
As shadows fall
And will my name be called
Up on the mountain bare
In black cloth dressed and desperate fear
As shadows fall
Silence of remembrance fades
I dreamed we once held hands but I awake
As shadows fall
In nomine Magnae Deae Nostrae
Introibo ad altarem
Dominae Inferae
Quae regit terram
I've tasted blood without tongue
My skin shed at your feet
Am I to sacrifice I asked the allknowing crone
Salvation can't be found in here I sadly sighed
Where is the sun Who'll light my day
Where are the stars Who'll guide my way
I try to hide but inexorably
a voice like thunder coming up
And as the midnight sun 
drowns the world in velvet light
I call your name through the ashes of time
Of all transgressions I can't take no more
Deliverance your love is all I implore
As flowers burn I hear the wolves return
At this desolate place
Lost in time and lost in space
Remembrance of a golden age
In these days of yore A magic spell
Was it your name I called
I'll try again
And like a dream
Your loving face
I touch your golden skin just for a while
Entwined we fly through the blackest skies
You smile I take your hand  back home again
Osculetur me osculo oris sui
Quia meliora sunt ubera tua vino
Fragrantia unguentus optimis
Oleum effusum nomen tuum
Ideo adolescentulae dilerexunt te
Trahe me post te
We'll make you pay this time
Rewrite the story
Repent now for your crimes
Break you down
Destroy you
We'll bleed you fucking dry
Bring you down
Dissect you
Feed you your empty eyes
This is the end of all you know
We are strong in number
United by one goal
Our lightning and thunder
We'll cast down on your soul
No longer fit to rule
The time has come to relent
Pathetic creation
Tear down and reinvent
This is the end of all you know
All you fucking know
This is the end
Of all you know
No more false prophets 
We'll burn them one and all
Powerless to stop it
We'll have complete control
Take you down
Despise you
And show you no respect
Smack you down
Defile you
What else did you expect
This is the end of all you know
Push the button
It's time to push the button
Destroying the gap
Between the pauper and the glutton
Crush the atom
Oh God  unleash destruction
Eat the turgid squalor of this creation
In a flash
A blinding white flash
Eliminate the epidemic
Of sentient trash
In a flash
Let all the markets crash
This downfall will lead
To the ultimate clash
BURN Burn it all down
Down to the ground
Reclaim the crown
Tonight we dine in hell
GET DOWN We've come for your kingdom
STAY DOWN Hand over the keys
GET DOWN Won't take no for an answer
Get down there you fuck
DOWN ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES
It's the ultimate violence
It's the ultimate show
You must pay for the crime
Of us needing to grow
There is no one solution
To this shit consequence
We now have to attack you
It's our only defense
BURN Burn it all down
Down to the ground
Reclaim the crown
Tonight we dine in hell
BURN Burn it all down
Down to the ground
Reclaim the crown
Tonight we dine in hell
BURN IT ALL DOWN
Today was a day like no other day
I have had it with this sad hypocrisy
And what is meant to be a civilised society
NO MORE
I won't back down again
A great way is raging in my mind
Ignore what I used to think as reason
And bear the brunt for all mankind
I've fallen down and I'm never getting up again
Apocalyptic HIGH
Laid to waste are all my mortal enemies
I drowned 'em all in a sea of rage and hatred
Losing all was the key to my epiphany
Set free from my overbearing apathy
NO MORE
I won't back down again
A great war is raging on in my mind
Abhor what I used to know as reason
And be the saviour for all of mankind
APOCALYPTIC HIGH
I have fallen down again
I am never getting up again
I have fallen down again
I've fallen down again
I am never getting up again
Apocalyptic high
I've fallen down and I'm never coming back again
An eye for an eye
No more
Great war
No more
To live for
Spewing forth are all these thoughts of anarchy
I can't stop it it's eating up my insides
Raise my fist to destroy this weak democracy
And build a one man autocracy
NO MORE
I won't back down again
A great way is raging on in my mind
Abhor what I used to know as reason
And be the saviour for all of mankind
Apocalyptic high
I have fallen down again
I am never getting up again
I have fallen down again
I've fallen down and I am never getting up again
Apocalyptic high
I've fallen down and I'm never coming back again
And eye for an eye
No more
Great war
No more
To die for
The truth has spoken
Spirit unbroken
Today outspoken
I just want to see God
I just want to play God
I just want to be a God
A perfect storm in a shot glass
And finally you can get a job
In your esteemed leader's entourage
He's not a black lung after all
We're one nation skewered
On a godless prong
Obsessed with beauties rich and rare
We understand no more
Insurgents grinding axes
With infidels
Demons blow out holy candles
We scream blasphemy
A hornet's nest we can never tame
War that cannot be sustained
Diplomacy or surrender
Here's your next dictator
With hand on your heart
And tears in your eyes
You'll defend this sunburnt country
Until someone else dies
No place sacred is a terrorist magnet
The west gettin' high
On the Middle Eastern dime
Has the audacity to deny
A refugee's plight
From places razed
By an axis of evil
We antagonised
And then failed to destroy
With hand on your heart
And tears in your eyes
You'll defend this sunburnt country
Until someone else dies
No place sacred is a terrorist magnet
Invaded divided and conquered
Never allowed to leave it
A war lord's cartel forever laying' claim
To lawless profiteering of the opium trade
Topple the statue
Tear down the flag
Usher in a new muppet
With finger prints up his ass
Howling like lunatics in this place we live
Contraband flowing free
Amongst the spiteful noseless faces
Of the dead reigning supreme
Join our cult
We won't negotiate
Or listen to reason
We'll kill ourselves and hold you to blame
Our ancestors
Each mongoloid generation
Will hold a grudge through centuries
And teach vengeance and hate
Our polluted blood line
A gene pool tepid sterile
Bring it down turn our home
Into a grave with a fuck you tombstone
Join our cult
We won't negotiate
Or listen to reason
We'll kill ourselves and hold you to blame
Oh masters of your domain
We're using your utopia as a cage
We'll bring the temple down on our own heads
Just to kill you our own way
A revenge taking 50 years
You can't forbid us  we're already here
While you graze and congratulate
We're fattening you up like prey
Join our cult
We won't negotiate
Or listen to reason
We'll kill ourselves and hold you to blame
Oh masters of your domain
We're using your utopia as a cage
We'll bring the temple down on our own heads
Just to kill you our own way
Join our cult
Join our cult
Join our cult
We'll kill you all
It's alive
Labs teaming with mad scientists
Playing jigsaw puzzles with genetic experiments
So we rip tear and shred
And create some horrible new shit
And I wonder are we God
Creating mongoloid babies and incurable disease
NO
So concerned about whether or not they could
That they never stopped to think if they should
Cannot see the forest for the trees
And I wonder are we God
Creating mongoloid babies and incurable disease
NO
And I wonder are we God
Creating mongoloid babies and incurable disease
NO
DOWNFALL
Decaying monument to human greed
Assemblyline shut down  rotting decree
The jewel in the crown of our western beliefs
Now plays the dead hand of false democracy
This is the natural order of things
As goes Detroit  then so goes the world
Artificial obsolescence  true essence
So say goodbye to the American dream
Driven to the end of the line
BLEED
All our resources dry
The end is nigh
So long Detroit and so long the world
Global madness
Spreading your disease all over the earth
Back to nature
Lord and master
Feel my rapture
This is the natural order of
Industrial wasteland so rank and obscene
A civilisation corrupt to the core
Tear it all down and wipe the slate clean
This is our new fight  this is our war
Dead arsenal of capitalist greed
As goes Detroit  then so goes the world
Artificial obsolescence  true essence
So say goodbye to the American dream
Driven to the end of the line
BLEED
All our resources dry
The end is nigh
So long Detroit and so long the world
Global madness
Spreading your disease all over the earth
Back to nature
Lord and master
Feel my rapture
This is the natural order of things
This is the natural order of things
As goes Detroit then so goes the world
This is the natural order of things
This is the natural order of things
DOWNFALL
The writing is on the wall
Downfall
Downfall
Back to nature
Lord and master
Feel my rapture
This is the natural order of things
LIES
Tired of the lies from the congregation
Listen up fuckers it's time to be rude
God is nothing more than a human creation
Evolution
This is how we came to be
Mass confusion
Your God Complex a mockery
Blinded by the faith in your own salvation
Ignoring all the facts is a way of life
Selfless but insane is the declaration
Evolution
This is how we came to seed
Mass confusion
Your God Complex a mockery
It's time to put an end to this profanation
By destroying this cognitive exploitation
Wisdom is the key to your liberation
Open your eyes and see the truth
God is a fake
It is a gospel of hate
Annihilate
This disease of the mind
It's time to put an end to this profanation
By destroying this cognitive exploitation
Wisdom is the key to your liberation
Open your eyes and see the truth
Tired of the lies from the congregation
Listen up fuckers it's time to be rude
God is nothing more than a human creation
Belly full of flesh
And blood and bone
I've had it all
But I want some more
Colossal feast
A black mass
Carnivorous lunatics
Witch hunts voodoo
And man eating freaks
Carnivores apocalypse
Auto cannibalistic
Carnallunarfrenzy
Lord of the flies lonely
Kingdom come starving
Eat your heart out baby
Ritual
Blessed tradition
Only once devoured can you be delivered
Belly full of flesh
Guts over flow
Black mass of bodies
Regurgitated souls
Carnivorous lunatics
With hunts voodoo
And man eating freaks
Carnivorous apocalypse
Auto cannibalistic
Blood dripping from your lips
Carnallunarfrenzy
Lord of the flies lonely
Kingdom come starving
Eat your heart out baby
Are you feeling afraid
Do you need someone to blame
Is free speech compromised
When you don't agree
Rage overflowing
Ideas in your brain are congealing
Does the thermometer in your ass
Have mercury rising
Boiled in blood
Are you feeling enraged
Are you happy afraid
Do you live broken hearted
And full of pain
Follow the leader with someone to blame
Lynch mobs and pied pipers
Running haywire at large
Insane
Boiled in blood
He feeds human puppies
From the paternal tit
The symbiotic bond keeps
The fantasy alive
They're weened and you're gone
Alone in your shame
There to begin the new cycle of repeat
You will never learn
A disappointing shit talking fleeting friend
You will never learn
You're God's gift to no one
A junkie to ego
Sometimes in life
You get pissed on
And fucked in the face
To control your own fate
You must first learn from your mistakes
Living in a fantasy
Stuck on repeat
Again you run home
To escape your deceit
It buries it's head into it's own arse
That stinks so good it hides the rotten fact
That it's a liar  now a pariah
You will never learn
A disappointing shit talking fleeting friend
You will never learn
You're god's gift to no one
A junkie to ego
Sometimes in life
You get pissed on
And fucked in the face
To control your own fate
You must first learn from your mistakes
Living a fantasy
Stuck on repeat
Again you run home
To escape your deceit
Gods gift to no one
Gods gift to no one
Gods gift to no one
You're dead to me son
No tear will fall
On the suffering stench
That lay in a heap
As I walk from prison to freedom
Dive for the noose
Dive for the noose
Dive for the noose
They cycle will be complete
Will you ever learn
You will never learn
Will you ever learn
You will never learn
Will you ever learn
You will never learn
Will you ever learn
Not fuckin' likely

Killed with a knife
You died for a different point of view
The evil judge
He took your life you said too much
They cut your throat
And spill your blood 'cause you betrayed
Their holy words
You never worried and now you're dead
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Fight the lies
Don't be quiet
We will
Tell no lies
No more lies
Thrown into fire
Your written word
They call it crime
No hope for the betrayer
Religious lies
While fanatic preachers scream
And the millions cry
No one used to see the truth
'Cause they're all deaf and blind
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Freedom for
The ones who dare to say the truth
The ones who tell
The stories of hate and love
If we don't care
About the written word today
Then we will lose
A part of our humanity
You wrote a book
You wrote a book with pages coloured
Red like blood
You never thought that it could be yours
As long as if
Intolerance bars every way of liberty
I won't believe in the human race
They are deaf and blind
You man
Lonely man
I know she'll satisfy your needs
Tell her what you prefer
I guess you've had problems with girls
It ain't so easy to
Find the one that will be kind to you
I've got a big choice for you
So choose the right one
To satisfy your selfishness
Can't you feel the pain she feels
Can't you see it in your eyes
Suck me
I don't believe a word
Don't you tell me tales of love
One man buys
And one man sells
Brown skin black hair
Exotic flair
You deal with living flesh
You order feelings for cash
So nice
She looks like a child
Like if they are wares
I don't believe in your tales of loves
The cry
Of the mistreated
The accusations of the one you've beaten
I hope it will
Echo in your ears
Can't you see
The stream of her tears
Your desire
Is her fate
You crush her soul
Without a trace of shame
I just got contempt for you
I don't believe in your Imported Love
Can't you feel the pain she feels
Can't you see it in your eyes
Suck me
I don't believe a word
Don't you tell me tales of love
My heart turned to stone
As I heard the news that day
The bloody game has started
In the eastern world far away
The cry of a million people
Echoed into a void
The arguments of reason died
As the first bomb was thrown
No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
Those who deal
All of you
Who deal with death
On the day of desperation
As the desert sky turned to black
Did you realize what you have done
When you used to deal
With poison gas
A war for oil
And bloodred sand
And Mr President who smiled
At his warmachine performance
And at the thousands who died
No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
Those who deal
All of you
Who deal with death
Sell the gas
History told you what to do
Poison gas
A memory of Nazi's world war two
The innocent
Nearly wiped out by your deadly wares
Industry
The dealers of death
Will we never learn
No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
Those who deal
All of you
Who deal with death
No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
No more colour in my life
All empty
Can't face another day like this
I can't stand the pain I feel
In the deep of my heart
The ignorant took it all away
All that had been
All I am
Inspirations
Torn away from me
And in the void
Only grey
Blind my eyes
But I see
Tell me lies
But I know
In this world of despair
Am I just alive to bear
And when I'm gone is what's left
Is there someone who cares
In this world of despair
Am I just alive to bear
And when I'm gone is what's left
Is there someone who cares
No more colour
Emptiness
Can't face another day
No more colour
Emptiness
Can't face another day
She was
One to criticize
She never had been quiet
Never no never compromise
She had rage in her eyes
No trust in no government
Searching for solutions
She thought that she could change the world
Time for execution
Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more
Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more
Down down
Into the underground
And never fight alone
She tried to make peace with a gun
And her heart turned to stone
No dreams
No illusions
And nothing changed at all
Hiding from reality
'Cause she always failed the mark
All those who died
By my gun
By the bombs
I wish all this could be undone
Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more
Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more
Coldness
A grey and rainy day
She wonders what went wrong
Wasted
Years have past by
She's getting tired of the fight
Now she can feel the emptiness
Deep inside her heart
While she tried to reach the light
She walked into the dark
Like the sun
That burns the desert ground
You leave scars
On innocent souls
You suck their brains out
And then fill them up with paroles
Young boys to tell propaganda tales
Look into these hopeless eyes
As they get raped
By the cameraeye
A young life sold to war
A wasted youth
Searching far a lost childhood
War is lie
War is cruel
War is lie
War is cruel
I've seen a lake of tears
Shed by the mothers
Of the disappeared
A sea of blood
Red as the sinking sun
We cry for children lost
In wars we never won
Cries of pain
That we can't ignore
All around the world when children go to war
So just switch on the news
Or listen to the radio
Look into these eyes
Like into a deep black  hole
I've seen this face
So many times before
Child of Vietnam or any other war
Young boys to tell propaganda tales
Soldier boy
Left to die
War is lie
War is cruel
War is lie
War is cruel
Fly with the wind
Over the land
Like a storm
Wild is your heart
Brave is the horse
That you ride on
No chains no walls
Only the sea
An endless distance
Faithful you stood
There and you watched
The sinking sun
So grateful the land
You held in your hand
You son of the wild
I saw tears in your eyes
Ride like the wind
Over the land
Like a storm
Indian son
You were so pride
You were free
Your pride has gone away now
Wiped out
Torn away
Dropped down
Like a tear
Now you dwell in your dreams
All the beauty I see
All the beauty I feel 
All the beauty I hear 
All the beauty in the world
Ain't nothing compared to you 
I adore you everyday 
I love you everyday 
I got all the time in the world 
To wait for you 
I'm in love with you
Burning so bright but still so fast 
Will it burn out or will it last 
This love feels so right 
So are you ready for this 
I see a star so bright in your eyes 
I feel the love of a dangerous kind 
I try to reach you with my heart 
You know I know you know 
Crave your love
Love me like I love you
Show me your paradise 
Hold me when I hold you 
Desire for you 
Kiss my sweet lips 
Lead me to the sky 
Teach me about all your things 
Your flesh your blood your you 
Tell me my love is enough 
Stop running I'll do
Caress your skin 
Like meadows in the wind 
Beautiful one
As the signs grow stronger 
And our fate clearer 
Take no precautions 
Follow your leader 
As our love grows deeper 
And we fill each other
Still admire the darkness 
Let it become larger
As life drifts further
Our beauty is the core 
Always sighing after
Still I crave more 
As hope alone grows higher 
It struggles to be free 
All that we can be 
Falldemiseall
We'redisguisedgone 
Weep together the rain to come 
Feel at heart the pain is gone
I feel like I am dirt to you 
You hate me cause I love you 
Just tell me why I'm so low to you
Didn't I mean anything 
Your happiness is my sorrow
My sorrow is my way
My life is a failure
Growing bigger everyday 
Does it make you happy to see me sad
To break my heart and leave 
Here we are 
You and I 
In the sun 
In the sun we're gone
My heart is still broken 
Forever my soul is frozen 
Still watching the rain to fall 
Forever standing in the cold all alone 
I'll stay here to the end 
Another day to start 
Another day to break my heart 
With love still no romance 
The fragile pieces of my soul
Belongs to you 
I hate to feel
I wish I couldn't feel at all 
Don't ask why I have to leave 
Don't know why I still breathe 
Don't understand why I'm still hiding 
All my thoughts for you saving my
Love for you 
Once again I'm living inside myself
I'm too tired of this life 
All I need is my big sleep 
You are so far away 
You love someone else 
Another day passed me by 
Another day filled with pain 
You are not here 
You're with someone else 
I love you to death 
You love someone else
So I just wanna die 
Create hate 
I hate myself for loving you
We have touched for the last time
You are long gone in love with someone else
I now fear nothing but life itself
I do not believe in life or in love anymore
The joy I feel are the joys of emptiness
I hate myself for loving you
Noone can see the emptiness in my eyes
Finally there is peace in my soul
To lie dead without a concern  without a tear
You own my heart
And life without you is so imensly painful
my face
your wonderful body and your good heart
You are everything  I am nothing
I want to die
But really  I am already dead
I will not live
Thank you for everything
Every moment you shared 
I appreciated your stay 
Every smile you gave away 
Thank you for leaving 
Now I clearly see the dark
Embraced by agony 
I fear nothing but life 
What's the reason to live if I cannot love 
I can't get over you
What's the reason to live at allBond of two
Wasted
By a word
World of lies
Now dead
Homicide
Of mind
Numb by the shock
Surprise
Drowning inside
A pool of sorrow
Milked out of hope
By those who care
No longer wish to see the sky
No longer wish to live a lie
Fed up with false truth
No more to suffer
Not another day
Fading into the unknown
Bleeding rotting all alone
The fire of life is long gone
This is the Last Dawn
Twisted thoughts
Inside
Trying to hide
Failure on all levels
The mixed elixir
Of two now broken
The one thrives the other rot
One lived on the other never forgot
No longer wish to see the sky
No longer wish to live a lie
Enough with this pathetic life
This Is The Last Dawn Of Me
Slaves we are
Slaves to Pharaoh
We can't see
Nothing but sorrow
''All men born to the Nile will be thrown
Though females will keep living on''
We were made to serve with rigor
Mortar and bricks made us bitter
In Egypt slavery
Pain 400 years
Pharaoh let my people go
Or thou shalt suffer so
Ten strikes upon your soul
'Till the last Egyptian fall
Pharaoh let my people go
Or thou shalt suffer so
First blood upon the Nile
Last your firstborn one shall die
''Let loose your chains of wrath
Upon this foul land
This Is My Command''
My people in pain
My efforts in vain
I yearn for your aid
Show me the way
So god strengthen the heart of the king
For him to feel the pain within
We were made to serve with rigor
Building the pyramids we feel so shuddered
In Egypt slavery
No rebellion 400 years
The angel of death
Passing over Hebrew's houses
Killing the first born sons
To set the nation free
And I stand all alone in a world of darkness
All sanctity is washed away
By crimson storm of false promises
Of human decay
We have betrayed our god
Now we worship the iron sword
We have forsaken the truth
Mislaid by a single word
Told by unseized hunger
For blood flesh control
They have burnt our eyes
They have burnt our soul
Merciless beaten by fear
Cruel lies No saviours in here
I have lost my life I have buried my sons
Turn my blood into wine
And they will pour it into a glass
They'll take a sip
Yet will never know how painful it tasted
Turn my eyes blind
I will wander through time
We were given holy earth
Now it is defiled
The Terror unleashed
The horror is pure
Pain deep underneath
Hidden obscure
The Terror unleashed
The horror is pure
Pain deep underneath
Hidden obscure
We are nothing but ashes
And cold graves of stone
As we keep on wandering
In darkness All Alone
We are nothing but ashes
And cold graves of stone
As we keep on wandering
In darkness All Alone
Off to the battle we go
Without fear
We know
Death is near
''Rain drops upon my companions' heads
Who are covering themselves
And upon the dead
Who are covering no more''
I will not fall 'till I kill
Though nothing but sorrow is real
I will raise up my sword
And kill to serve the lord
Rain upon the battlefield
Lived to see my hopes fulfilled
I have killed to stay alive
Now side by side we'll strive
Oh god salvage my soul
Before the rushing end
Blood rains down from the sky
Cleansing the land
Jehovah's tears falling down
Soaking the pain
Waged the battle won the war
Now we can slowly decay
Awaken from the storm that washed unbelievers
Yet hasn't kept away the sinners
For it all been spoken the same
Therefore all had understood
The human ambition to raise his name
And build a tower that could
Reach the heavens
Rise up high
And touch the light
Upon the sky
To test their power
To test their god
And build a tower
It's head in the sky
For all to see their strength
For the fear of being scattered
Had they enrage their god
Had they forgot all common sense
And so the lord came down from heaven
All charged with his splendouring wrath
Had they enrage their god
And forgot all common sense
For the lord came down with wrath
And with swift punishment
Prevent the humans
The heavens to reach
And deprive them
of One Single SpeechStain my eyes with guilt
One winters day it all be gone
Bless the mournful eve
One secret kiss and shame to feel
The bleak that I must know
And passion lost beneath the sea
For I am the silver blade
To cut you deep and fade with thee
God to raise the weak
Again this rain and hate in me
Grief fall on every man
An endless pain in shadows sleep
Lost within the hateful visions
Strangled child in the crowd of liars
Whores stripping before me
Inside the walls of this mighty castle
The frost bites deep the trembling soul
Agony is poured upon the silent winter
Where are you now my true Lord
White snow like heavens saddest tears
All mercy fading inside the wretched heart
Slay my emotion and cry to my death
Feel the chill inside the desolate soul
Wasteland of frozen thorns
Bear the light the lonesome flame
Into the night to rise the day
Choking fool to gather the rays
Death is love and all in vein
Silent winters day
One touch to see the pain is real
Cry for life once lost
A drop of blood on pure white snow
Sentenced to silence blamed for all sins
Reaching to darkness burning my skin
Saved by no one forgotten instead
One sacred angel one sold to the hell
Rivers of fire will burn
My final damnation to torn
In blindness of joy I reborn
To dream again of my fall
Burning in fever holy I become
My religion is fire endless I become
Devils and angels the pit and the cloud
My ashes and dust feeding the cursed ground
Rivers of fire will burn
My final damnation to torn
In blindness of joy I reborn
To dream again of my fall
Walk with me burn with me
Into this lake of thousand flames
Let yourself to drink my pain
Swallow it up and be empty again
Rivers of fire will burn
My final damnation to torn
In blindness of joy I reborn
To dream again of my fall
From the voice of the beast
And of the broken beggar
Thy ocean shatters the waters spits storm
Bleeding into the heart pure blood
Poisonous nectar gods feast upon
It bleeds into you
Girl has been made for the lust
Womanly virtues are shed with the tears
Oh this torment in passions war
Playful whore sinful bitch your love
Hold her no one else but her
It bleeds into you
For all times that are gone
Close the black eyes of the eve
For the time you spent crying for me
Close the starring eyes and become a fool
For me bleeding
Loneliness emptiness sickness
Merciless bastards vicious dogs mauling
Your flesh holding your breath
Lord please hear the cry of your child
Even if he is filth even if shes a whore
And I will walk in the serenitys meadows
Slipping among the temples of Christ
And I will watch how my ocean enrage
Down on your earth bleeding into your eyes
The devil outside and sorrow enters my home
Waiting so silent and black hours pass
Tearing my mind from my dying soul
They come they go and kill
The wretched shades after the rain
In this world a dying stare
I cant help you to your grave
No one calling my name
Filthy man designed for blame
Reborn once again from the dust
To strive once more for the lust
The devil outside and emptiness rise
Waiting so silent to my demise
Licking my wounds and caressing me
They come they go and kill
The wretched shades after the rain
In this world a dying stare
I cant help you to your grave
Daggers like teeth bites my body
Savaged by their anger and hatred
Scorned by the world to the end
Lock away the silent cry
See the light so deep inside
Whore and liar dressed in blight
Eyes are closed mouth cannot sigh
Tell me all your sins
I will be in your soft dream
I will try all your delights
Then caress your sleeping face
What do you feel when I am inside
In your room resting in your chair
Talking to your cat and ignoring your presence
In your room the pictures of sadness
Hang on the walls hiding the holes
There is nothing to do at your home
But to sit and to stare at your misery
Careless for the lives of the people
Sick mindless bastards young and too old
In their homes in their beds
Filth and ashes from the broken hopes
All are washed away by the tide to the sea
Crushing demons from the deep burning pit
Stand at your doors crawl in your bed
They beg you to tell them a short fairy tale
Before the endless torturing sleep
They are like you I feast upon you
Of what you should not covet cowardly disdain
Wanting to divulge craving to share your exploit
Greed in being the king naive of the penalty
Reveling secrets proceeded to deceive
Never seen it coming blinded by camardine
Trust an afterthought of what would not occur
Reflection powers fury dominating need to act
Desire for revenge strengthening resolve
Fleeing for respite antagonism boiling over
Settling at hand consider your life
Forfeit in every way repugnance in my sight
Must prolong your agony persecution cruelty
Your backstabbing morals have taken away my life
My conduct in your torture must make it worth it
Haven't thought out this process I've undertaken
Misery saturates all know to find me satisfied
There will be no peace for me now
Distrust for anyone I'll ever encounter
Your treachery will die with you
Showing what is prudent
You prove our task
A worthy undertaking funneling your fury
Greed and corruption things that are below you
Open minded fairness
Masses echo truth
We proclaim your heroes citing their humanity
Media slanted bias can't be real this day
It must be coincidence
Why are some misguided
No time to debate anyone who is beneath us
Not in our refinement more like neanderthal
Intellectual obscurity disease of the vagrants
Not for us enlightened the brains in the room
Everyone thinks like me
We must be are own sheep
Silence all our critics
Dissent can't have a place
Exile them underground
Why should are careers change what we believe
The duty to guide the quest of knowledge
Framing facts to ascertain the proper conclusion
Helping the ignorant peasants of the populace
Blameless on the right side
Influence justified
Technological pariah daunting powerful adversary
Taking advantage of the window of dominance
Mesopotamia to Rome earned right of an empire
Inferiority a sickness only cured by ambition
Desire for revenge fucking drive determination
Proof of power eradication assured
Unequaled supremacy fleeting determination
Greek fire spreads panic watching vessels burn
V2's from somewhere horror in the skies
Trepidation over napalm contagious panic spread
Destined to obey or face the vile consequences
Rage replaces righteousness no way to fight back
Rattle the cage of those who feel secure
False belief in strength
Easy way to get dissected
Something more than a saber
Stirs resentment lower existence
Others rise to prominence
Transparent gloating fuels disgust
Resolve of a sickened nature
Pressing to overcome
Indifference a way of life
Fundamental instinct
Occupying fear
Imposing your will on those who can't resist
Predator of hope
Submitting you souls begging for sympathy
Marauder of faith
Anticipation of any thing to help you
Searching for mercy
No pity for you fucking worthless
Foreseen the future coming dismal regret
Selfish disposition paybacks in order promptly
Power control the means of commerce dictate
Predict choose who suffers largely downfall
Guardianship a must regardless of your net worth
Bailouts reign in all manipulate enduring crowd
Boundaries in line unyielding law
Prosperity as a whole oppressing individuals
Merely burdening our future generations
Why should we care
Taxing you to death regulate your life unrest
Ensue
Must show discipline follow the rules in place
They only adhere to you pay or you're condemned
Constant pressure to relinquish more control
Believe
in the promise that they can handle the power
Establishment knows better than you do
They just might fulfill the prophecy
Using influence to take care of you
Limit personal freedoms reimburse combined debt
Trusting fools inflating dependence
Incentive gone to attempt to strive for
Relying on yourself
Giving back clout was not part of
This covenant that masses signed on
Was not signed in blood
Pursuit of a conflict
Respecting no one
The stance of the vicious
Malicious bout condemnation brutal beat down
Hostility ferocious war overwhelming
Trouncing every foe obtainable
Indulging in mindless belligerence
Ordinary pain less satisfying
Searching for significant anguish
Sadistic concept edging towards reality
Man made boundaries pleasing the public
Menacing necessity assaulting rationale
Envisioning agony intention is clear
Impulsive deed aspiration concrete promise
Eradicateagitation remove constraint
Encroach lucidity permeation
Motivation swelling to the surface right now
Stalking feeble prey oblivious of harm
Eagerness to the pretense of an onslaught
Without hesitation to inflict anguish
Passion to hunt down and dissect
No grief involved
Sorrow of others my peak
Fulfilled purpose
Assailing the victim delight
Repulsive pleasure
Pursuing culmination of bliss
Premium brand of rapture
Cruelty not even a thought
Nasty nature is habitual
Ongoing incentive to implement climax
Crushing any thoughts of hope
Beyond stalking the painful interval
Teasing concluded invasion commenced
Chronic motive of smashing into ecstasy
Carrying out the obstinate fantasy
Basking in the triumph
Execution expertise
Cessation at leisure
No urgency abound
Evasion halting the trance
Forgetting promise made in the campaigns
No desire to advance anything but stature
Keeping up the facade reaping all the benefits
Not considered corrupt just shadily comfortable
debates
The celestial altar of fortune
persuading men to maliciously guard
Exchanging ideas assets or support
protecting the culture of greed
Solidifying your place in the institute
circling weapons always on call
Rubbing resentments fanning hostilities
making sure that you are required
Relaxed immorality takes getting used to
Transformation easy tasting the prize
Merit of compensation roughly void
Perverse means to warrant return
Crooked malevolence can inspire some to rise
Above the law untouchable prominence
Portraying the figure the followers adore
Preying on the people you preach to help
Lobbying for earmarks sanctioned for them
Starling revelation entitlement is yours
Dishonesty the tool to keep your pockets full
Fuck them anyway because they'll contribute too
Your enemy swell from apparent voiced weakness
Propaganda offered on a plate you concede
Not wanting to face obvious dangers
Turning your back on rage and hatred
Innocent analysis simple view of the world
Ideological objectives priority over conflict
Burying your head in sand safe and sound
Acknowledgment of the treat you contradict
The way the world should be hollow dream
Strength and power of the hour gone
Will prevail no substitute for gallantry
Courage to face something menacing
Prepared the boldness to confront your foes
Recognize daring to defy your peril
Bewilderment abundant
Among rational witnesses
Pandering your platitudes
Obsessed in the belief
Unfathomable viewpoint needing others' adoration
Mystifying concept compassion keeps you secure
Adolescent notion that philosophy disarms
The pacifist religion perception of the immature
The antiwar constitutes bowing to their dogma
Hijack your defense expose vulnerability
The vice of beseeching gratification in frailty
Further spreading support of vacating campaigns
No burden to explain your puzzling outlook
Must have confidencein their sincerity
You have assurancethe enemy is harmless
They are trustworthydespite the wickedness
It's an illusion
Why defend yourself through dialogue is power
Stated goal your death room for compromising
Start with concession surrendering advantage
Conceding any guilt irrelevant of fact
Open hand of peace commence cooperation
No need for caution now that we are affable
All historical grievance wiped away over night
Astonished by attack considering harmony
Burying your head in sand safe and sound
Acknowledgment of the treat you contradict
The way the world should be hollow dream
Strength and power of the hour gone
Will prevail no substitute for gallantry
Courage to face something menacing
Prepared the boldness to confront your foes
Recognize daring to defy your peril
Requirement of elucidation no options to evade
Modify adapt and change the rules as you please
Treaties of the past can't be found
By constraints
None shall dictate the privilege
Others are devoid of
Ethos of coercion
Subordinates implement all warranted bidding
Requisitions honored securing selfish esteem
Skepticism marred fear of condemnation
Persecuting the chosen for the lack of adherence
Seize consign demand all detail
Lie dispatchdiffuse will convey
Acquiring comrades for the endeavor
Diminish culpability
Quick pick bit by bit
Now sit and drift
Feed is over
Do ya feel sick
A craving so strong
Believe it talks to me
Served as a joker
But I acted like a king
Conversations to myself
Boarder line skitsofrantic
Lost my control and left us in automatic
Or lose me within the panic
I feel invisible
Scrambling Rambling
Too many thoughts
Can't fucking handle em
They're demanding
That I start planning
The mastered the art of dismantling
Its gone past the point of fixation
Now I'm just waiting and pacing
put ya teeth to curb
And stomp with out hesitation
1 2 3 4
I feel invincible
Why
What
Who
When
Where
The questions that go and strip bare
Life is a fucking illusion
It plays fair when you don't care
You get the answers to all of the above
But when you search you find fucking NO love
And it triggers that sense of failure
When you just realize how lonely you are
But everyone can relate
SO WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE NOT TRULY ALONE
The transmissions
To the system Is to satisfy all divisions
Take the time to listen
Twist the systems they will glissin
But keep in mind Are you lying
Ah FUCK
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'M LOSING MY MIND
GET A GRIP MAN
Gotta keep in time
Fucking step in line
NO FEAR IN YOUR MIND
You can do this YEAH
Aw FUCK YEAH
How am I meant to speak without guns
How am I meant to speak without guns
This is a bullshit way to die
My back will be
FUCKED
At 50 and a high chance I'll be blind
But I guess that's just normal life
And I think we're a lot closer to the fine line
Of bringing back a chaos of a life time
Because people can only break so much
Pretending to be happy
When most of us will
Accomplish a whole lot of nothing
So lets just fuck shit up
Cause I've had enough of this no hand touch
I WANT IT ALL
SO BRING IT
I see you probing
Searching for clues
Reaching to the depths
The inside of you
Learning what's behind you
Leaping to the past
Bringing back those memories
You never thought would last
Then it all floods back
But its been a wild ride
Maybe one day you will wake
And it will all be a distant dream
The moment that you are living
Irrelevant
No matter how important it seems
Weeks rinse out the days
And the months turn to years
But your brain holds on to everything
Then it all floods back
But its been a wild one day you will wake
And it will all be a distant dream
There's a war coming and it's up to you
Where it starts
And how it ends that night
Just drop the act and live in mirrors
Now and then it all floods back
And you can say that it's been a wild ride
But one day you will wake
And I swear you will hate every moment
I am truth
I am the liar
Your perception of time
Is the only thing that defines
What you do and how you do it
And round off the minutes
You're left with the hours
And that's all you've been given
So take your chances
Then take some more
For death is not the only pain time can't fix
Regret hurts until we
Learn to cope and set it aside
But it never leaves the back of our minds
It's the scars on your heart
That tear you apart
I'm talking to YOU
Yes
YOU
Whoever is listening through
Take a few minutes to look back
And see the change
I've instilled in you
Don't deny it
For the first time be true
To YOURSELF
For YOURSELF
NO ONE ELSE
BUT
YOU
Were you the glass that everyone saw through
Or were you the bait for everyone to chew
When the devil kicks
You will be on cloud nine
Just the rain that's to come
So you turn to guilty pleasures
When it's just not enough
Are never seen again
Send your god to the lions
And you will know what to do
As it enters your mind
Send your god to lions
I forever cast a spell on thee
For piece of mind
That you'll be fine
From you to me there is hope I get to sleep
And some dreams Its only you that I see
For its only you that I want to see
Please can you let her go
I'm begging you
Stop standing in the blind side
I know its you
One more time
Picture a movie like a bullet in your head
Repeated dreams
That I'm repeating dreams
And dreaming I'm repeating
Repeats in my dreams
Back when we were young
Together we only wanted love
That was all I ever got from you
And though you're gone
IT WONT LEAVE ME ALONE
Think happy thoughts and fly away with me
Just close your eyes and drink
I give up
I'm calling it in
Cause just as I feel whole
The sunlight reminds me Its not real
I brought you back for a sense of understanding
That you are the air to all of us
BUT IF YOU CAN HURT ME
HOW CAN YOU SAY
THAT I HAVE GONE TOO FAR
If you love them Let them go
The hardest statement I have ever known
Cause if you love them
Let them know
I forever cast a spell on thee for piece of mind
That you'll be fine
From you to me there is hope
That I get to sleep
And some dreams its only you that I see
For its only you that I wanna see
Why does everything I ever try to love
Bring me to my knees
Is it against them
Is it them against me
Is it you against us
Is it us against you
Is it all against none
If it gives into some
I am given a choice
Either be it
Harm
Or
Befriend
that's what my conscience said
It's up to you
who do you choose
Be careful where you tread
It restarts and I reset
And if I give you the opportunity
You do it again
You come to me visible in my dreams
and I remember you
Because you are me
And I say so much
Yet I hold my tongue when I am told to
Speak
Take it back
And it takes back
How many times
I've wanted to die
Couldn't add up for the times
I've done right
But still festering
A moral crime
That's never in play
But always on side
Fucking
1
2
3
You better welcome me
On your feet and feel defeat
Cause now we all
We have control
GET THE FUCK OUT
FUCK OFF
FUCK ME
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU
FUCK ALL OF YOU
How many times have I wanted to die
Does it still add up right this time
I JUST TOLD YOU TO GET THE FUCK OUT
I try to run
But I never get far
I AM STUCK
And it's the same reason I stay
I wake up prepared to betray the day
Yet the only fucking time I was ever positive
Was when I lost it all
And couldn't give a shit
How do I control
How do I control meParalysed cannot move at all
From the imminent strike of the beast
From the depths of hell the deep blue sea
The demon has come for the feast
Attack is swift attack is fast
Life flashes before your eyes
When the devil strikes there's nowhere to hide
All around shall hear your cries
With crippling pain blood spills from your veins
Its time to face your demise
A thousand knives ripping through your flesh
Through your blood the beast shall rise
Salvation is all that you seek
With every bite the sea starts to change
Your blood shall stain the sea red
Servant of death
Killer from the deep
Your final breath
Death you shall reap
Eyes of black
And a heart made of stone
Shark attack
You've entered the killing zone
Watching over savage grounds
Within his laws you are bound
Pulling strings he makes your every move
Bodies mark your path to take
In these fields you'll not awake
Cut down your final place of rest
In this world he calls his own
The loss begins the seed is sown
The futile battle for your life and soul
Stalking through an unknown land
Your life is taken by his hand
No one can escape the god below
The skies turn red and wait to fall
Dawn of destruction await its call
To darkest black this land falls to its knees
Do or die his only words
Say your prayers can they be heard
In the chaos you find that you are lost
Let the heavens bleed
We hunt for reverence not greed
From heaven we angels fell
Banished to the kingdom of hell
Holy war wages strong
Mankind stands and looks on
Loyalties meaningless
Our faith in you it now turns to dust
In you we trusted
But you condemned us all
In you we trusted
So now your kingdom shall fall
Mankind shall face our wrath
Their burning souls light our path
Blood shall cover the land
Sentenced devastation on our command
Guard your heavens gate
You'll fall regardless of fate
We'll take back what is ours
Paradise forever ruled by our hand
In you we trusted
But you condemned us all
In you we trusted
So now your kingdom shall fall
A dead dawn's mist unearthly cries
From shallow earth the cursed rise
A life of death broke and decayed
They walk again to bleed the day
Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
The periled souls have gained new birth
They march again to reap the earth
Desecration darkest times
The living suffer for their crimes
Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
Trapped by terror hopeless plea's
Last prayer to none fall to your knees
Save one bullet for the end
On bitter peace you can depend
Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
The living dead
The thirteenth strike
The demons come out to play
The witching hour
They hunt for flesh the prey
All hallows eve
The dead shall rise once more
Hell unleashed
This evil beats down your door
Repent all your sins
Pray to the above
For God to save your flesh and your soul
Terror never gives
Delusion never lies
All hallows eve once more gains control
Start to sweat
The blood runs cold in your veins
Afraid to move
Fear takes hold of the reins
On this night
Your loved ones return like before
Run for your life
Your loved ones themselves no more
Repent all your sins
Pray to the above
For God to save your flesh and your soul
Terror never gives
Delusion never lies
All hallows eve once more gains control
Inertia
against all you took comfort from
even the firmest cornerstone
I cannot fill this emptiness
The ground is falling from under me
We lose ourselves in our regret
Were holding on to a memory
I stand before you for all whove ever grieved
and all who have suffered
This too shall pass
Their silence haunts my thoughts no longer
Dearly beloved gathered here
Dearly departed forever near
In hearts and minds of those you leave behind
your names will live beyond your graves
I am the product of everyone Ive ever known
I am the places that they call home
Ive spent my life chasing ambitions
that were just beyond my reach
knowing all my best laid plans
might leave me reeling and empty handed
Vicious circles are a false sense of progression
Every wrong turn one step further from my goal
furthering the distance in my mind
but hesitation is a dead end road
It seems Ive always run away
Turned my back on uncertainty
Never dared to face my own worst fears
until my reflection shows me
My heart will never be another unrequited dream
Searching for so long just to find
what was right in front of me all this time
It takes so much just to open up your eyes
And when you feel like you're alone
Nothing comes of apathy
Stay safe in your skin
You cant ignore the itch that creeps in
Stick to your senses
This flesh a rusted cage now tear it off
Your mouth holds a devils tongue
that whispers liquid lies to thirsty ears
who drink your poison words
Youve always reaped but never sown a single seed
Youll never fucking grow
You will never fucking grow at all
You will never fucking grow
Now I know this time
your colours will fade to black and white
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
Ill web my way inside your mind
Every memory will be laced and tainted
If you were bound to me
youd be my misery but Id be your end
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
Now I know this time
your colours will fade to black and white
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
If you were bound to me
youd be my misery but Id be your end
No words that spill from your mouth
could overcome the ringing in my ears
The blood is pounding in my temples
and it deafens me engulfs my thoughts
After waiting and wishing for so many years
I have turned back the clocks
trying to fill the hole that was left
But an empty heart could never fill one so pure
And now Ive seen the end of all Ive known
My chest is sinking like a stone
Ill wait for the numbness to set in
and hope Ill never feel again
Its getting harder to face the truth
but my frustration is fruitless
I cant decide for you I cant decipher you
And as Im getting older Im starting to believe
As the years keep slipping by
This time I wont look back
My heart was always in the right place
And now Ive seen the end of all Ive known
My chest is sinking like a stone
Ill wait for the numbness to set in
and hope Ill never feel
The past has proven through days gone by
those fed by cruel hands
seem to sharpen their teeth for the bite
while below the skin lies potential
to choose a greater path
Realise your actions hold consequence
and for each misguided step you take
someone must bear the weight
Compromise is never something Id take lightly
knowing when our lives diverged my friend
you chose the wrong path
Carve these words into stone
I have waited patiently for this time
I will leave behind a legacy
The weak willed will rupture and break
Compromise is never something Id take lightly
I will be the change that is needed
I will be the foundation stone
This narrative begins at a point in time
not as you were but as what youve become
a brother to all but a son to no one
I was once not unlike you
Benign and beaten down
I scoured the corners of the earth
in search of a better way
and where you found that sinking feeling
thats where I found myself
ensnared within a vacancy that only I could see
Each step I ever took was a vow
never to return to that place I left
in search of what I always lacked
My security
so I made a promise to myself that I wont break
Meet me at the turning point
Ill be waiting there for you my friend
Give me strength
Give me a new mentality
Give me hope
Meet me at the turning point
Ill be waiting there
Give me strength
Give me a new mentality
And give me hopeInertia
against all you took comfort from
even the firmest cornerstone
I cannot fill this emptiness
The ground is falling from under me
We lose ourselves in our regret
Were holding on to a memory
I stand before you for all whove ever grieved
and all who have suffered
This too shall pass
Their silence haunts my thoughts no longer
Dearly beloved gathered here
Dearly departed forever near
In hearts and minds of those you leave behind
your names will live beyond your graves
I am the product of everyone Ive ever known
I am the places that they call home
Ive spent my life chasing ambitions
that were just beyond my reach
knowing all my best laid plans
might leave me reeling and empty handed
Vicious circles are a false sense of progression
Every wrong turn one step further from my goal
furthering the distance in my mind
but hesitation is a dead end road
It seems Ive always run away
Turned my back on uncertainty
Never dared to face my own worst fears
until my reflection shows me
My heart will never be another unrequited dream
Searching for so long just to find
what was right in front of me all this time
It takes so much just to open up your eyes
And when you feel like you're alone
Nothing comes of apathy
Stay safe in your skin
You cant ignore the itch that creeps in
Stick to your senses
This flesh a rusted cage now tear it off
Your mouth holds a devils tongue
that whispers liquid lies to thirsty ears
who drink your poison words
Youve always reaped but never sown a single seed
Youll never fucking grow
You will never fucking grow at all
You will never fucking grow
Now I know this time
your colours will fade to black and white
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
Ill web my way inside your mind
Every memory will be laced and tainted
If you were bound to me
youd be my misery but Id be your end
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
Now I know this time
your colours will fade to black and white
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
If you were bound to me
youd be my misery but Id be your end
No words that spill from your mouth
could overcome the ringing in my ears
The blood is pounding in my temples
and it deafens me engulfs my thoughts

And give me hopeMy world seemed perfect
so warm and full of harmony
I saw a future so constantly
But I was blinded by the light
I did not see what was behind
I did not recognize the truth
Instead I put my trust in you
I forgot that trust means pain
I forgot that nothing is forever
I forgot that life's an unfair game
Witch you can't win never ever
I will not recure what went wrong
I will not be a fool anymore
I will not be as blind as before
Never again
After all I'm alone in the rain
but I've learned to strangle the pain
To see my life in a different point of view
I no longer care about you
Do you know the kind of feeling
Which says everythings alright
While you know it's not
Do you sometimes take a look in the mirror
Asking yourself whats wrong
What is true and whats a lie
I remember the day that changed my life forever
I remember the moment that opened my eyes
Since them Im different not the same anymore
I hated myself for so many years
Days in grey senseless hours
There were so many I stopped to count
To save my will to live
I did not see the beauty of flowers
The green of woods the smile of the sun
I was forlorn in agony
I hated myself for so many years
I hated myself for so many years
But the chance of a new life was always near
I can remember times of peace and of complacency
so many people surrounded me my whole life long
but like shadows fear the sun they are all gone
I am lost in my memories of colors and lights
My eyes wide open my blood's running fast
I am caught in delirium am I alive at last
While the world is high on fire
And everything we are used to be
Is close to falling apart
We act like there is nothing
Nothing that tempers delight
Nothing concuss our lives
And forces us to hell
All around me people telling their stories
About how great and selfless they are
But if you need help without reward
Nobodys there no one cares
They always said 'become whatever you want
I will live my life
Without these inner strife
Just be a man of his word
Among this perverted world
Just a few out there will understand my vision
And not many of you deserve my trust
But for those who always stood beside me
I will walk through fire and dust
I didnt see the blue in the sky
Although I knew the sun was shining so bright
And still I hear the call of my inner voice
I still see the shadows behind the lights
Again Im running 25 hours a day
The sins of my past right next to me
Again I know that all this beauty I see
The night falls apart
Colours return to life
Feelings so long forgotten
Fulfil my soul again
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
So undo yourself and just be
It will all come naturally
This game insanity
Open your mind
Make the connection
What are you wating for
Played out procrastination
Be at one with your heart
In the mirror is where it starts
The future could be so endless
Whats so hard to understand
Let your conscience be your guide
Pass over those who have lied
Make your world clear
Stand up to your fear
It won't be and easyt thing to do
Make and create your own rules
Only you can decide what is best
Now put your life to the test
In the end what matters is
What you decide
Let the genie out of the
Bottle inside
Realize the potential in you and me
This game reality
You get to do as you please
Why is my life for you to tease
I'm trying to cut this chord
Trust is a luxury I can't afford
Thank you for making me feel my pain
Opening my eyes to see I'm truly insane
I breathe out while all breathe in
Is your beginning my end
If I'm the monster waiting to be
It doesn't give you free integrity
I stay up late at night thinking
About what you said
What right do you have to play
With my head
I try hard not to hear your voice
Same room no choice
Another chance to fail
Is wisdom just another name for hell
I still hear the words you speak
Enter the shadow of the weak
Uncertain the blur in my eyes
I search the truth it's all lies
I tried to ignore it all
The weight brought me to a fall
All the guilt and the shame
It's us who are to blame
There was no excuse
For your life to abuse
Played the executioner
Guilty of legal murder
Thoughts of nothingness
Feelings of emptiness
Gray clouds hang over me
Images of what came to be
The pain I feel I can't hide
It hurts to cover up what's inside
I wish I could take it back
Seeing your eyes rool into the black
Who were we to decide your fate
Told you we loved but all was take
Mourning again it's a loss
Shoul've done better whatever the cost
We let you down in the worst way
All of this is why I'm saddened today
In my world there's cause for alarm
When I watched you die in my arms
All of this is making my soul bleed
All I ask of you is will you forgive me
Every day I fall beneath
My dreams so out of reach
The goals we all wish for
Better future nothing more
I feel so distraught
When my lessons don't get taught
Amused by what I put myself through
Regression is nothing new
As I keep wondering
There's got to be something
Do you feel better when you loose again
Are you afraind of what you might win
I am searching
I get no feeling
Something is tearing me
No peace I struggle eternally
My past is meaningless
Your present is emotionless
Our future is bottomless
Nothing more that makes sense
I see everything yet I see nothing
I hear everything yet I hear nothing
I feel everything yet I feel nothing
I live everyday and yet my life is nothing
Trying to get through to you
Simmering with a dejected view
Thoughts get washed out nothing I can do
Straining so hard for my aims
End up feeling just the same
Whats the matter change of heart
Too scared to finish what you start
What I want I can't have
Thinking about it makes me sad
Are the answers sought
Have my feelings been bought
You represent something
I can't ever have
Because your miles away
From my grasp
Leave me in my loneliness
Can you touch me
Ignoring my distress
Can you hear me
As you pull down the blinds
Can you see me
Ignoring all the signs
Can you feel me
Doubts come from behind
Waiting for the outside to shine
But it never does come
Not after what you have done
Reality sets the ride
I took a peek outside
Quickly I turn away
Sometimes I shake
My feelings make my heart brake
Sealed myself
The doors are locked
The curtains closed
I turn my back
The truth erodes
I sit quetly
With my face in my hands
Patiently waiting
Draining out like hourglass sands
Memories forgotten
Forfeit my soul
Can't seem to break this
I refuse to let it go
I wasn't prepared
In truth i was scared
My life was given
I cried but you didn't listen
I'll always be there for you
I heard you say
I waited forever on that long autumn day
Your poisonous promises
Killing of my innocence
Eternally running from responsibility
Thanks for that lethal dose of pain Daddy
All day I waited on seventeen
Something special became a bad dream
Was it in your nature to do what you did
I could not understand any of this
I was just a kid
Was it in your nature to push me away
No father to help show me the way
Was my birth an intrusion
I see you live in illusion
Yes I waited but you never came
My life was never the same
Is that what you had in store for me
Scarred for ever emotionally
Hours I watched the cars go by
That day a part of me died
When you die you'll die alone
Just words from a son you've never known
I know no joy
Only sorrow and pain
I have evertying to lose
And nothing to gain
Once I stood so very tall
Now I feel I'm nothing at all
As i search this quest gets shorter
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger
Forever fading losing my grasp
I wonder whos having the last laugh
Each night I sleep as if it were my last
I tire of living out lifes' task
I feel I can no longer hold on
So it's you who must stand up and bne strong
These things I ment to tell you
With my own voice
But I was hurting so much
I didn't have a choice
There's nothing left for me now
You must carry on somehow
You may not understand
But it will come to you
Just what I've been going through
Deep in my heart I know I'm good
Sometimes I don't see it even if I could
I have to do this to be free
I can't take any more misery
Overcome these thoughts that surround me
I can feel myself drowning
There's so much I could never live up to
I never ment to be a burden to you
I can see you as the tears swell up
Find your strenght don't ever give up
These questions I long for
Which were never sought
This isolation
Further spreads the rot
Release these chains that
Kept me all in a bind
Reliquish myself to
Have peace of mind
My life's been punctuated
My price for hesitating
Total selfdetonating
There's no other reasoning
To rid this imposter inside
Time to say goodbye
I apologize for putting you
Through all this
Deep in my heart
Who I always will miss
Take care so long miss you forever
Goodbye
I have this urge to die
Another plane to the other side
Look at my life
Nothing left inside
All my frustrations
I could not find a release
My death will come
At great ease
I've felt i've never belonged
Doesn't matter when i'm dead and gone
Life is no longer a wheel
It's time to give you the real deal
From the cradle to the grave
I've never had my way
No one will miss me anyway
The method will be of my own design
Don't be sad at what you're going to find
Got tired of hurting in this world
I don't want to live anymore
Watch myself spill out on the floor
Really it's all for the best
Gotta get a god
Then you found faith n we wonÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t part
Gotta get a god
God  My god  God
You got your god I got mine
In dust I trust shopchop a line
Guidelines to live memorized rules
Become a phanatic 1 suckers tool
God  your god  some god
God  why gods  no god
Gotta get a god
All hate  war now  before
Still your highscore
Underpaid in the shade I got better things to do
Like many kids I had my vision
What to become my future occupation

You really brought this upon yourself
You knew itÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½d come to this
Once so alive but now too dangerous to kiss
Too damaged and infected face your/the world
The bottomless pit coming your way
No air to breathe judgementday
The bottomless pit coming your way
ItÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s getting hard to breathe
I got a bunch of whitecoats on my tail
And with their service I canÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t fail
Another bloodtest another session
Still on the juice How about aggression
They want to make a man out of me
As if I owe a cent to this society
They are the reason for the so called anarchy
Shrinxntherapists are on my back
This hellhound stray is fucking hard to track
This bloody crap is not about to change
I see blackeyed action nonstop kickin' through
Another 1 buysthedust loud mail lunacy
Another 1 buysthedust
Loud mail coming in  Hi male coming up
I cut myself bloody I drank myself sick
I smashed my place up did I change anything
The ugly taste of someones tomorrow
The ugly taste of the black bloody hell
I drove somebodies car and bought myself an axe
Wacked a lot of brain wasted a lot of time
who the fuck reads signs
The ugly taste of
Got myself evicted lost my drivers license
Wacked a lot of brain wasted a lot of time
My fucked up past is someones tomorrow
The ugly taste of Enjoy
How much more can you take
Of the hate they create as they lie to your face
What the fuck can you do
More dollar signs
In their golden mines/minds
See the ego shine greed makes you blind
day of the rope day of no hope
Smoke gets to my head as my whites turn red
Slow another show in the temple of thoughts
Sleep not mine to keep but fuck knows I fought
Cool creative and damn collected
Cold Cold cheap and disconnected
From hashish to ashes in dust we crust
Lost Profits POD Korn some 41 Mushroomheads
A lullaby soundtrack for the ones born dead
Look dumb act weird ripped shirt ohdear
No hope No future No balls  that suits ya
On MTV I rest my eyes misery in disguise
Makeup tune down new wig
I thought was mine
Black burnt shell  Frozen inside
Disgraceful  All cold inside
Seeing myself so dark and so serene
My world seems to crumble before my eyes
Crumble into eternity
Black burnt shell  Frozen inside
Disgraceful  All cold inside
Sorrowladen and too weak to let it go
Crash and burn this is a deadend
Seeing myself so dark and so serene
My world seems to crumble before my eyes
Crumble into eternity
Black burnt shell  Frozen inside
Disgraceful  All cold inside
Black burnt shell  Frozen inside
Disgraceful  All dead inside
Hail to thee thou new moon  jewel of the night
Hail to thee thou new moon  mother of the stars
There I shall be again by the beating drums
Hail to thee thou new moon  daughter of the sun
The equinox of the night is here 'pon everyone
To the other world
There I shall be again by the beating drums
Where the spirits ride the winds
And walk on
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
When is this spirit to be reborn
To reach the beauty of forevermore
Baptized in fire selfslain by thought
Immortality is what I have so long sought for
When is this spirit to be reborn
To reach the beauty of forevermore
Baptized in fire selfslain by thought
Immortality is what I have so long sought for
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
And the Sun it burns so bright
I have travelled through strange dimensions
These are the times of stranger aeons
And the world will burn
What you abstain to end your life
Should I kill you before the life does it itself
Your selfconsciousness can't accept your life
What seem to be The death of vanity
The mask that covers up your selfesteem
Is the one created by your sanity
The mask that covers up your selfesteem
Is the one created by your sanity
I feel that I have gone too far
I will greet the eternity for you
As I turn away
What once was shall never be again
Immortal I lust unto the eternal end
What once was shall never be again
Immortal I lust unto the eternal end
Born of thunder amidst the pouring rain
I shall be once again
Where angels fear to tread
Ravens rule their kingdom
Ebony towers scarlet jg
Before the greatest battle all mortal flee
The winter of thousand years
vanish all weak mortality
I fell on my knees without mercy
I could feel the noose strangle me
My eyes couldn't see I couldn't speak
When the season of withering came on to me
Be smothered in pain and all in vain
Do you really think you are sane
Be the one to yearn you won't learn
As the season of withering comes on to you
Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again
Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again
Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again
Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again
Shrouded in mist I stand here above the world
After the clash after the glow of war
And no one to shed no tears for humanity
Sky is burning trying to burn away
Of humanity
There's nothing but grey all life is lost
There's nothing but grey faded into grey
But the winds are the only ones to howl
But the winds are the only ones to howl
all life is lost faded into grey
And it all turns to grey
The skies are open smell of a danger in the air
Adventures calling beyond the faraway stars
No place to call home in underworld or sky
Living on the edge looking danger into the eye
Flying towards the stars so bright
Straight into the heart of the night
Wings of darkness carrying the spirits of us
The skies are open for atomic Vikings to roam
No place is safe from us in underworld of sky
The new experience you made is digging your mind
Surrender to us leave the past behind
Here's the New Machine
We are your machine
Doomsday is near there's no place to run or hide
We're devastating got no glory got no pride
Blasting through your ears with power and might
No reason to defend just join our fight
Back on the streets running out of control
Mind eating beats will conquer your soul
Up from the ashes and back on the feet
Don't take us too serious we don't even do
The power is with us but we're never true 
I can't believe all the things that you do
Don't start living
Turn on the TV await something new
Give it to me
Switch off your brain let the pictures flow on
Hypnotizing
Flickering reality
While your own life is left undone
YOU HEAR YOU FEEL 
YOU SMELL YOU SEE 
YOU TALK YOU THINK
MY FRIEND YOU DIE YOUR LIFE
I can't believe all the things that you say
Don't start stumbling
Got no intention or sense anyway
Fool on duty
Degenerated disciples of lies
Don't ask questions
Keep on believing
What you see is always true and right
You die your life
Manipulated poor existence with no aim
You die your life
Isolated mass obedient and tame
You die your life
The ultimate religion spreading true belief
You die your life
Friendship seems to be a foreign word for you
Every second somebody gets hurt
You rape their feelings every time you're around
You make a hush of every smile next to you
Because you're an asshole so don't waste my time
You're just an asshole you don't change my mind
Pray for salvation on earth 
Admit the mistakes you made 
And then show remorse
Pray for salvation but redemption is far 
This is a warning don't forget who you are
Every time it's the others fault
When you are screaming your inner self appears
You're just jealous of the others' pride
Because you're an asshole so don't waste my time
You're just an asshole you don't change my mind
You can't change my mind
Pure black surrounding me my eyes opened wide
The time has come to leave this ordinary life
Your call from down below thy will shall be done
Hear my call pass the gates
Feel my warm embrace take your father's place
Leave the world you will learn
Merciless regime honor to redeem
Darkest visions coming true
Eternal plagues wait for you
A voice in my mind imagination or real
The descendant 
Something inside confusing my conciousness
You're the descendant
Heir to the throne receiving the burning crown
The descendant 
The future of hades
You're the descendant
The heritage of hell the fallen angel's son
Two thousand years of doom I will overcome
My father you're too weak now I'm in command
The emperor of hate they'll suffer until the end
Leave the world you will learn
Merciless regime honor to redeem
Hear my call pass the gates
Darkest visions coming true
Eternal plagues wait for you
A voice in my mind imagination or real
The descendant 
Something inside confusing my conciousness
You're the descendant
Heir to the throne receiving the burning crown
The descendant 
You're the descendant
Strong metal that surrounds me
A thousand feet down below
Brilliant brains in strategic games
And I am the host of the show
Rise the curtain sing my song
And dance to my cruel melody
The call for peace is the hymn of the weak
Miserable tunes in my ears
You're deaf dumb blind
You waste my time
Cause I decide
I won't wait no more so
Raise your fist to heaven
You are marching off to die
War's the only way to peace
This life is yours but this world  is mine
This world is mine
After this bittersweet taste of my might
There's only silence around
Don't you dare to say any word
Just got permission to think what you want
My life's too short to reach for the stars
I know some day my time will come
Still I reign my democratic dictatorship
For this time history will be done
You're deaf dumb blind
You waste my time
Cause i decide
I won't wait no more so
Raise your fist to heaven
You are marching off to war
Praise my name and play my game
And those who do not follow i ignore
Forget what you've been taught
Cause i'm the one who's right
War's the only way to peace
This life is yours but this world  is mine
This world is mine
This fuckin' world is mine
Only mine
11 am and a new day begins
A hammer in my head smell of death in my mouth
Life returns to my body again
Yellow cab I remember the case
A murder and a blonde loads of money and me
No solutions only questions confusing my brain
Take the hand to the bottle and cheers 
So many chicks beside me when I ride the tube
So much money awaits me if my numbers appeared
Who's the man behind the mask 
Who put the poison in the flask 
Who you gonna call A man like me 
No idea no idea 
Crime scene but I cross the line
I'm afraid another unsolved crime
So much honor and glory will never happen to me
Take the cattle chicken pigs
Feed them with a bonemeal mix
How wonderful their eyes begin to roll
Bizarre dance on the funny farm
Hole brained beef won't do no harm
What does a cow a brain need for at all
Infected 
Take the incomplete creation
Eliminate abomination
You are perfect and so the world should be
You tinker at what you don't like
To solve what's hidden deep inside
A hail to cosmetic surgery
Infected 
Take off make the space your own
Calculate your way back home
Through the journey I'll be by your side
And if you dare to find a place
To haunt and finally to waste
I start the epidemic then
And get the whole wide universe
Infected
Start up the engines when the sun goes down
Still feel the heat around
A perfect fusion made of man and machine
All systems checked the orders clear
At last all doubts have disappeared
Among the smell of sweat and gasoline
In here to be just you and me
Together we will fight the abstract enemy
I draw the lines into the sky
With best regards it's time to die
So get prepared and kiss your ass goodbye
Eyes of the world  follow the action
Watch every move  war tv
Out in the fields  be my companion
Whipe out them all  war tv
My missiles hit the target exactly done my work
Mission accomplished as the fires blaze
No fake it's life what you have seen
Now pan the camera right to me
So that the world can see the smile on my face
Gunfire we're hit pure blood i spit
The bastards cracked us up we're going down
They drew a line into the sky
With best regards it's time to die
I get prepared and kiss my ass goodbye
They broke my will i'm not the heroe anymore
This ain't the picture you've been waiting for
Down on my knees your gun released
World's on location when they blow away my head
With best regards it's time to die
Stay tuned and see another try
Of entertainment on your war tv
I am the one who's near beside you
When night devoures day
Just wait a few more hours
Your life will fade away
You thought that life could last forever
What a fatal fallacy
Confronted with your unknown inner self
I lead you to your destiny
I'm closer than your skin the enemy within
Flowing through your veins into your brain
Devastating all I get you under my control
I will cause you sneaking endless pain
Endless pain
What would you pay to sleep just for a moment
To get a rest from being scared
I will not leave I blur your every senses
I hit you when you're unprepared
When I behold the fear within your eyes
It fills my soul with lust
I know the pounding of your poor heart
Is gonna end up in the dust
I'm closer than your skin the enemy within
Flowing through your veins into your brain
Devastating all I get you under my control
I will cause you sneaking endless pain
Endless pain
Now that your pulse is growing faster
You feel that I'm so close
That rushing in your ears I love it
Adrenaline overdose
Your shivering body your staring eyes
Sweat running down your spine
To realize that you are me
Total collapse of your mind
I'm closer than your skin the enemy within
Flowing through your veins into your brain
Together we enjoy your endless pain
Endless pain
Tell me why I stand here again
I cannot seem to make up my mind
And now I'm right where I wanted to be
But still I find it hard to smile
I wait for the euphoria to come
Maybe I've got it all wrong
I'm stranded
On the fields of life
No
Not again I said to myself
But there you were and shook me around
Dragged me out from the cave in my mind
A place I wanted no one to find
Destiny has always had a way with me
Opened up my lying eyes and made me see
I hope you hear me
When you come too near me
I don't know how to handle desire
On the fields of life
I don't know where to go
On the fields of life
I don't know where to turn
On the fields of life
I don't wanna lose what I have found
A light in the darkness around
Why can't I let go of the fear
And let all my doubt disappear
I depend on the balance divine
Always so hard to combine
I hate the insecurity inside of me
I will always be my biggest enemy
I will always fear me
Cause when no one steer me I will go
Into the fire alight
On the fields of life
I don't know where to go
On the fields of life
I don't know where to turn
On the fields of life
I don't wanna die alone
On the fields of life
It' the twinkle of frustration in your eyes
That reveals your illusion
A life built on bundles of lies
For some time I believed you
And the stories that you told
It really was a glamorous display
Now your fortune is long gone
Reality is heading your way
Trial and error without reason or rhyme
Trial and error takes us further apart
Never learn anything from mistakes or by heart
But you're not so keen on taking my advice
You're so blind you don't notice
You make the same mistake twice
Trial and error without reason or rhyme
Trial and error takes us further apart
Never learn anything from mistakes or by heart
Mountains of failure
You're standing on the top no one can see you
Mountains of failure
You're standing on the top no one can hear you
You are stuck in the circle chasing yourself
With no way out there's one thing you must learn
At the end of the day
There's no more bridges to burn
Trial and error without reason or rhyme
Trial and error takes us further apart
Never learn anything from mistakes or by heart
Let's try again
He always tried to seize the day
Now he let it slip away
Shining sun or falling rain
Doesn't matter anymore
Another boring day begins
Already knows how it will end
And now he's losing faith in you
You used to guide him
You showed the way the he should follow
He built a world upon your promise
He would be saved
He's all alone no one to hold
When the nights are long and cold
He prayed to you for some relief
For some reward for his belief
He tried so hard to do it right
Saw the world in black and white
But now it's fading into grey
He feel temptation
He's never had a night of passion
Or numbed his mind with the firewater
Never felt alive
Oh he's lost again
Now the world will see
Another soul led astray
Another destiny thrown away
The one way ticket in his trembling hand
Is the testimony to the tragedy
Was he never meant to be
never meant to be
He boarded the plane towards the end
A grave among the neon lights
Realized his wildest dreams
In a drunken hazy night
He sold his life and the money made
Spent it all on the last crusade
His celebration of the end
The one's who found him
Said he smiled and looked so peaceful
And in his hand he held a letter
It said No one came
I hope you're happy in the world beyond
That you find what you need
That you get what you want
The world has lost again
And no one will see
Another soul led astray
Another destiny thrown away
The final letter in his lifeless hand
Is the testimony to the tragedy
Was he never meant to be
I still feel your presence
Although you're not here
Your voice your smile and laughter
Is now replaced with fear
I'm holding on to memories
That slowly fade away
Force my self to hold on
And to live for one more day
Time is a twofaced creature
Of mercy and of pain
No way to control it
All efforts is in vain
Destiny is lawless
It makes up its own rules
Together they are mocking
And make us look  make us look like fools
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
And be a part of this world once again
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
You held the fate of my life in your hands
I thought I could handle everything
I thought that I was strong
Life was running flawless
And nothing could go wrong
But I froze when I saw it coming
Oh the turning of tide
Washed away in sadness
With no place for me to hide
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
And be a part of this world once again
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
And be a part of this world once again
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
You held the fate of my life in your hands
Now I Am here again
So tired of pretending
I know what my life is about
Trying to find a way
The almighty solution
Before I have run out of time
I still remember when
I believed that the fire
Inside me was destined to burn
Every day and night
For as long as 'I'm breathing
Now only the ashes remain
Always seek always speak
Of the moment all comes together
Am I back right on track
Are the changes made to the better
I hope that what will end all this confusion
The conclusion
I am just healing the wounds of my soul
healing the wounds of my soul
Maybe I'll never learn
From all the mistakes I have done
Since the day I was born
Maybe I'll die alone
Surrounded by memories
Of all of the love I denied
Always seek always speak
Of the moment all comes together
Am I back right on track
Are the changes made to the better
I hope that what will end all this confusion
The conclusion
I am just healing the wounds of my soul
Here in the darkness
I wait for the light to arise
Here in the darkness
Will someone please show me the way
To reignite the spark
And let me glow again
Here in this empty room
In my tower of sorrow
I decide to start over again
I hope to find someone new
That will search for the pieces
And try to recover my heart
Always seek always speak
Of the moment all comes together
Am I back right on track
Are the changes made to the better
I hope that what will end all this confusion
The conclusion
I am just healing the wounds of my soul
There's a place that no one knows of
A safe haven filled with bliss
It's far away I'd like to stay there
And make my clouded sky clear up
No tears no sorrow
In my hideaway of dreams
Suddenly my pain has turned into laughter
And soon reality comes crawling again
Disabled as I lie you enjoy life
you enjoy life
There's no light where I'm abandoned
I've lost all track of time and space
No friendly face is recognized here
Behind my eyes I'm still awake
Suddenly my pain has turned into laughter
And soon reality comes crawling again
Disabled as I lie you enjoy life
you enjoy life
I'm stashed away to waste away
I won't be preying on your mind anymore
I will forgive you will forget
What goes around will come around at the end
Suddenly my pain has turned into laughter
And soon reality comes crawling again
All my life
You have been here beside me
Through the days and nights
We were as one
Now you're gone
I'm sorry that I couldn't see
That I treated you wrong
That I drove you away
Oh my love don't leave me here alone
Oh I cannot make it on my own
Without you all I am will slowly fall apart
Now and then
I feel you inside of my soul
Like a flash of light
In the dead of night
Everyday I hope I will meet you again
And invite you to stay
Forevermore
Oh my love don't leave me here alone
Oh I cannot make it on my own
Without you all I am will slowly fall apart
Then there is moments just like this
Times that I so dearly miss
When you return in all your glory
A piece of paper and pen
Some time alone and then
We are immortalized forever
I beg you
Don't ever leave for good
Nothing can move me when I'm fading
Slowly turning into air
No one can see me when I'm hiding
Somewhere beyond reality
I'm drifting away to my own landscape
Floating on the rivers of despair
I let it slip away
I am safe here
Inside my white darkness
Problems don't bother me in here
All alone here a world in white darkness
The one place to where I always will return
Always will return
I won't deny that I am tempted
To stay here and to never ever leave
But to go where for good I need a reason
A battle impossible to win
Nowadays I'm stronger feeling more secure
Dealing with my problems that I've had before
I've finally found the harmony I need in life
I need to be awake don't let it wither away
We all have dark days in our lives
Any loved ones will believe him
Before we die
I am safe here
Inside my white darkness
Problems don't bother me in here
All alone here a world in white darkness
The one place to where I always will return
Always will return
Now I know nothing's what it seems
Money talks
Now I see religion screams
I believe in what I hear and what I see
and in myself the king of my own destiny
The angles of heaven the demons of hell
are creatures we had to create
Why are you scared to see who you are
and be in control of your life and fate
I can't see why you choose to dedicate
all your life to assure you enter heavens gates
I can't say that I am right and you are wrong
but common sense can tell a truth or two
All those lives lost in battle of belief
It's all because you were born to believe in
different lies
The angles of heaven the demons of hell
are creatures we had to create
Why are you scared to see who you are
and be in control of your life and fate
If god is above us and Satan beneath
we all belong here on earth
Cause no one is good or evil to the core
We all have our halos and horns to bear
I told you my secret you said it would be safe
You would never show and no one was to know
Sharing my burden giving some relief
That was my true belief but the I was deceived
Kissed me like Judas and poisoning my heart
That's what you've done to me
I want all of the world to see
Oh I wish we'd never met
It's time to forgive now it's time to forget
Then these feelings would be gone
It's time to look forward it's time to move on
I'll never know the answer why
Never know why
Don't need your confession or any lame excuse
Because what goes around always comes around
A line that you can't walk
Writhing on the floor
You won't be aware 'til it's too late
Cause you never look around
You're like a deer in the headlights baby
Start a fire and you can never put it out
You're burning up in the blaze you started
I want to see you face down
Because I know that you play that part so well
At our wake the casket is open ready for viewing
But we are still moving
Already we smell of rot
There will be no comeback
No coming back for any of us now
No way out
Don't you realize there is nowhere you can hide
No way you and I will ever be done
We're never apart
Whatever you're doing
We will always cross your mind
You were young and now you pay the price for her
I don't know your name but I know you
Do you lust for fame or forgiveness
Well I'll give you everything you want
Well I'll give you anything you need
Now you've stuffed your throat
You've walked on your burial ground
Oh you'll draw the crowd
With honey porcelain skin and crystal baby blues
You wear your skin so fresh
Your smell intoxicates
Little starlet
Got so much salt from your lies poured into me
You didn't see yourself dead already
So full of with every breath you breathe
Long as it feels right
I had gotten frozen by the way you walked
It's a coverup
I know everything
You're made for letter fame
Regret is part of your name
There's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted to feel
It's what you're dying to feel
Check out your face on the wall
Like what you see
I'm sure you see yourself oh so unique
You're just a sucker for the flame of the week
Nothing is what you think
I could never have
Standing here with you
One regret
One mistake
Nothing we could do
After this is done
You can go your way
Don't forget
This is how
Everything should be
Don't you ever go
Now
You laugh forever you laugh
The winner and the best man
Corrupter
Shapeshifter
Your voice is the sound of nothing
Butcher of every artform
Peddler of deceit
Watching the hour hand drag
Destroyer of the past
We're smart enough to say we're sorry
Not smart enough to start again
Dancing in death's illusion
The pride before the fall
Candy for the children
Give it to them all
Fallen angel how you've changed
Poison runs through your veins
You were never a saint but now you're a sin
Spoiled rotten from within
Who clipped your wings so useless
Cut them yourself
Chewed off your own
Good thinking
Through the fever
Not the first one
Not the last one
I'm not sorry for you
And I thought you knew the same
I know truth will set you free
Cracked and crazy baby
My thick tongue hangs down low to the ground
Licking up the sweat coming off of her heels
She wants my teeth to wear
She wants my hell to bear
Well missy it's a lock for load
If you wanna grind hips don't do it alone
Don't save no dance no not for me
Just cut me out
Well you thought you'd tear my skin from bone
Just cause it was cold and you needed a coat
Oh you're getting so sleepy tonight
And you wanna go home but you don't have a ride
No time just taste won't touch for free
My salt your sweet
And you were there
I see right through you
We never even noticed that
There always was a reason
That we were never meant to be left alone
This feels like neverending
You are only the faded star of my design
Walk forth
You're the fulfillment of a fallacy
A creature from fantasy
Don't think that you ever knew me
Don't you ever see
Don't you ever see
Won't you ever see
You and I will never be able to end this
You say someday we can start up again
Without a plan no sign of the pressure
I say you're crazy
I hope you see my face in the mirror
You will never learn
You're forever dead to me
Won't you ever see
Your shadow
I made a big mistake
With you tonight
The way our insides burned
Like moths flying to the light
I know the games we play
Give us a way
A way for us to see if we still feel alive
We'll never feel like anything is wrong
The tragedy is not just our own sad song
Walls we have built and bridges we have burned
Deeper the hole the farther we feel from harm
Time is always right behind us
Like the lamb under the gun
I'll hold on to this forever
This is never long enough
Stumbling over dead forgotten
Catch you and the secret falls away
Falls away
You were drunken from delusion
Slipped and so the secret fell away
Fell away
I see you
Tears in your eyes
Yeah this party is a bore and you're the joke
Me and you
We are the light
Sit with me
Give me your hand
You should go your way
You are no friend of mine
Life still lives on lives
Red sea inside these walls
Commerce is your god
Cannibalistic flies
Monarch of your womb
Messiah of your thighs
How sacred is the web that must be spun
Your taste is on the tip of every tongure
Down lets stay down
Take me all the way
All the way down
Shout shout out loud
Make us proud for days
All the way down
Give to fire
Beyond the soul desire
Our trust runs out tonight
Everything we said dissolves
And now we say our last goodbye
Nothing to resolve
I never imagined you'd turn into this
But then the end was always close
We could feel it all along
Don't you know where
We could hide the lies
You were a mouth without a heart
An action without meaning
And you walk afraid
Reaching for the hands that turned closed
Quickly in my race
The music is very strong
I feel full of rage
With the ones that reject my dreams
I open my eyes and I feel metal
Flow all the veins of my body
The beatings of metal give me the life
My heart lives for metal
Long road traveled through
Thousands of experiences lived
My heart of metal will not die
Everything that I feel is true
Every day I need
My dose of metal
Wherever it is
Metal will never die
The headbangers are all together
The first riff will raise them
Will flow for all the veins
The dose of metal to live
True friendships began to grow
All met by a single reason
The love to metal united us
Forever to our final day
Every day I need
My dose of metal
Wherever it is
Metal will never die
Quickly in my race
The music is very strong
I feel full of rage
With the ones that reject my dreams
I open my eyes and I feel metal
Flow all the veins of my body
The beatings of metal give me the life
My heart lives for metal
Long road traveled through
Thousands of experiences lived
My heart of metal will not die
Everything that I feel is true
His soul is full of revenge
The pain drove him crazy
With his axe in hand
He will destroy you quickly
He lives hidden in darkness
Nobody knows when he will attack
The hatred doesnt leave him to see
He attacks without mercy
If he traps you are lost
Because he is the skull breaker
The murderers of his family
They walk along the streets
Without knowing who waits
Sooner or later will find them
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
The insanity says him that is a play
A bloody and macabre play
Will he continue killing people
Will he continue breaking skulls
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
Has begun a bad day
With the fists in high
The adrenaline is running
The adrenaline is burning
All in the streets
They show rage and violence
They accuse all the abuses
They want the head of the damned
Here we are
In the middle of chaos
The riothas begun
A true war
Both parts attack
Not measuring the consequences
Only blood and pain
The city is ruined
The tranquility erased
All will begin again
A great reconstruction
Here we are
In the middle of chaos
The riothas begun
Has begun a bad day
With the fists in high
The adrenaline is running
The adrenaline is burning
All in the streets
They show rage and violence
They accuse all the abuses
They want the head of the damned
Here we are
In the middle of chaos
The riothas begun
I have the power and force
I have a place injured in my soul
My dreams are like the fire
My dreams devastate all in their road
Destroying and devastating
Doesnt matter to me the pain that caused
I feel as my own fire burns me
My only worry is to fight steel with steel
Our projects and illusions
Our families and lives
They are in a latent danger
Each second of life to be the last
Power of fire
You burn our lives
Power of fire
You fight with the steel
Our projects and illusions
Our families and lives
They are in a latent danger
Each second of life to be the last
Power of fire
You burn our lives
Power of fire
You fight with the steel
Power
Power
Power
Of fire
The world day by day is worse
The power gives them the advantage
They satisfy the thirst of wickedness
They satisfy the thirst of impunity
They are damned murderers and lying
All the corruption they should hide
The damned impunity will always exist
And the politics is overshadowed
Thirst  eternal thirst  eternal thirst
Thirst  eternal thirst  eternal thirst
We are them affected same old
The violence continues exploting
The bloody wars will enjoy
We continue without hope in darkness
The faith that nobody will save
The divine images will be dispelled
The fight against evil will begin
The world scandal will explode
Thirst  eternal thirst  eternal thirst
Losing life remembrances of cries 
Frozen images of last sick days 
Recalling desolation no one cried my death 
The acrid taste of rotting takes my breath away 
My violet lips covered with frost 
The paleness of those walls is lost 
It's fucking lost 
The winter grows cold 
It takes me into the frame of dust and old 
The silence in me 
Please Death set me free 
Fallin' upon my buried coffin 
the snow freezes my last smile 
And the tears are crystallized 
But the pain remains in me 
Still and cold and dead 
My body lies under the ground 
A withered flower falls on me 
Upon the ice of my grave 
ENTOMBED BY WINTER 
Memories of life times lost in my mind 
Ages of a forgotten existence so far now 
Dusty shells of pictures buried by years 
Tell me who i am 
Tell me how to see my dawn 
Tomorrow 
Were we born to struggle and suffer  
Happiness is a short while 
Where we forget to be humans 
Hate is only a waste of time 
The cold is growing end of days 
Hold my body and take me far away 
Far away from this grave of  frost 
We must enjoy these moments of inhumanity 
Before they take our dream away 
ENTOMBED BY WINTER
Last night I walked again that soil 
places in my mind 
Remembrances as cold pieces of glass 
Blood red stained mirrors 
lie broken upon the floor 
A time so far  Something we can't recall 
I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
I can't describe the day 
when we crossed our solitude ways 
Deserted houses  Haven of mine 
Tombs under eternal fog and frost 
The pool of blood is turning cold 
as we watch our reflection 
becoming red as December dusk 
I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
You'll never cry alone in the rain 
The sleep will heal our solitude days 
They'll never live the meaning of parting 
Souls left alone in the night 
as tears flow with the pain 
Loneliness coldness and bloodlust 
Alcohol razorblades and the same old places 
Blood tears and semen 
the only human things will be left of me 
I love the night as I love your eyes 
You'll burn inside the cold lands of my heart 
Our way together towards inhumanity 
Our dreams without any God above 
I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
We'll never cry alone in the rain 
Only Death now could divide our solitude ways
Darkness enshrouded from within 
Bitter rest in overwhelming solitude 
Sleeping aeons and mountains 
To conceal the tearing grief 
A human life is not worth more 
Than a tear stolen in a frozen dawn 
Than a drop of blood on a yellowed paper 
Than a shiver in the sharpened rain 
No way out of this terror 
Distance like an empty winter night 
Pieces of me randomly scattered on the floor 
Shrieks of dying animals inside my soul 
Trapped among the mortal ones 
My mourning is in vain 
Unveiled dreams have turned to nothing 
Fed on the wrecks of unanswered questions 
A human life is not worth more 
Than a tear stolen in a frozen dawn 
Than a drop of blood on a yellowed paper 
Than a shiver in the sharpened rain 
No way out of this terror 
Distance like an empty winter night 
Pieces of me randomly scattered on the floor 
Shrieks of dying animals inside my soul 
Silence is trembling screaming its rage 
Screaming 
NO WAY OUT
Lying in a dark corner 
The black candle light is dying out 
Trying to refuse this suffering 
As coldness burns my pale naked flesh 
I faced my fears a thousand times 
Endless doubts  Life of paranoia 
I try to find a way out 
From this state of suicidal urge 
I watch with empty eyes the blade 
As tears begin to fall down my face 
Another night alone with myself 
At one with melancholy and depression 
I bleed because the dark is near 
I cry as i realize you can' t be here 
I need to caress your skin in the night 
But now my only friend remains this knife 
Why must i live with these fears 
I know my only tragedy is my mind 
Sometimes i think i'm wasting all the joys 
And with this bitter thought i fear to die 
I feel so jaded now so far away 
I can't face next morning with this pain 
Another cut lacerates my flesh 
Sometimes i think it will be the last 
I'm only trying to objectivate this hate 
I prove towards myself and life itself 
I only need to watch these fifty wounds 
I opened upon my body in the night 
I only need to stop these sick death thoughts 
And cry for joy when you'll be here again 
I'll watch you sleeping naked at my side 
I'll kiss you and this blood will stop to flow 
Everyone can kill himself one day 
Life brings pain and suffering on our way 
Cut your wrists it's simpler than it seems 
But in death you'll know

StaticCatafalque
Memories on Memories on Memories
Thoughts on Thoughts on Thoughts on Thoughts
Rainpins breathes the Air on all numb Sensegates
Sluiceblockades are to release golden Bells
NervecracklingWounds bombard last sane Craters
On Fire the Stormhorses of Benightment ride
to trample with Chaos all Orientation to die
and disease and lay waste to your bubbling pores
The soft murmurs poured forgiving 
and with envious assault laid waste my breath
And cut the seams that held together my breath
Lifeless I lie thoughts tear my mind and you fly
Slip the warm knife through my searing flesh
Nefarious agony slips inside my smile
this silent room
still all was weak
to echo through your soft murmurous heart 
and pierce your every word
To leave not a trace of those moments
that filled the empty halls and cold 
The word that crawled around inside falls away
that the vapours of passion drop to your feet
From this angle it almost looked human
But the hole in the ocean just swallowed me up
Down here you may hear a sharpened scream
forming featureless enfettered states
that have me tearing the walls of danger
down here all is dark and dazzling
in the swaying of the breeze
elusive gaze
the unmoving view
tenderness 
of a narcissistic funeral 
that injure my dreams
narcissistic dreams
Idle minutes devour 
Open space seething nebula
takes hold and strangles 
dripping torment Bright and lucid
Colours meld 
design that seem to dip and swerve
to fathomless depths where eyes can drink 
the sights of dreams
atoms solidify 
but truth through the separated darkness
With morningfall emptied
From the window the sky empties to nothing 
plunged into a diminishing perspective
from the dead branches
but before they cold leave
they spent a cold summers eve
tending the knotted despair
of a ravaged corpseMalcom King
Scots follow you
Into battle
We will go
Conquer Lothian
To the river Forth
Overcome the Angels
Win the war
Defeated Ecgfrith
at Nectan's Mere
Subdued the picts
we feel no fear
Forge a kingdom
Take you down
Cut to pieces
In blood you'll drown
Fires in the sky we saw for 30 days they shone
Unitedunited we stand
Unitedunited forever and ever
Into battle
Kill and fight
Forge a kingdom
Scotland unite
Malcom King
You won the right
Take the throne
Scotland united
It's the year 1018

to the battle of Carham
We will spell history
Get your steel brothers
We must fight
Hakon tries to steal
Scotish right
Norwegian soldiers on our land
Steal our Islands
We must defend
Their number's too great we can't win
God in heaven
Send a sign
Kneel and pray  the sun turns black
God with us  we must attack
In the dark of the sun
Alex king you did
win the day
You bet Hakon and
Proud Norway
We swept them off the battlefield
In their blood they lie
Death is dealed
Their king died on foreign land
United we were strong
we did stand
In the dark of the sun
The enemy's defeated run
In the dark of the sun
The battle has been won
I don't wanna be a hero
But I'll stand and never kneel
Freedom is well wort a dying
Come we'll fight with heart and steel
Beat the English at Sterling brigde
I will guard the Scotish throne
I myself skinned Cressingham
In his own blood he did drown
Fight  Freedom we fight
Stand  Scotland's pride
I am just a simple man
I'm afraid to meet my end
Braveheart they call me
If they knew if they could see
Edward's out to seek revenge
His army's great his soldiers strong
Come with me to fight at Falkirk
Send them back where they belong
I don't have the blood of kings
But I'd die for Scotland's pride
Even nobles follow me
Into battle side by side
Fight  Freedom we fight
Stand  Scotland's pride
Nightmares haunt my lonley nights
I must be strong and I must fight
Braveheart they call me
If they knew if they could see
I am just a simple man
I'm afraid to meet my end
Braveheart they call me
If they knew if they could see
Vengeance burns a raging anger
I have lost the fear to die
Braveheart that's what I am
I kill until my blood runs dry
The lust for battle in my veins
inspires me to take your life
Braveheart that's what I am
I kill until my blood runs dry
The lust for battle in my veins
inspires me to take your life
Braveheart that's what I am
I kill until my blood runs dry
I kill until my blood runs
I kill until my blood runs dry
He came in the dark night
Few men at his side
Black Douglas' arm for the Bruce
They could not loose
Stab Red Conym down
He won't wear a crown
Fight and kill we will
Win the Battle of Louden Hill
The heart of a lion
The blood of kings
A sword like thunder
Death he will bring
I am The Bruce  The King The Lion
I am The Bruce  The Master of war
March against me  pay in blood
I rule forevermore
The Bruce was crowned at Scone
His glory shone
Still the English are marching
We'll meet them at Sterling
One 'gainst three we stand
Fight for your land
The Battle of Bannockburn
A lesson they did learn
Goodbye my love I leave my fate to the king
I must be off to battle fortune it may bring
Fortune for the nobles
Death and Pain life will be sold
Goodbye my love I must fight and I may die
The king is calling I must obey
why do we have to kill
The Reaper laughs I hear him still
Screams above the battlefield
Steel and Blood a fate is sealed
The harvester of Death is out
Can't you hear him scream aloud
Into the battle into the battle
Can't you hear the screams from Flodden hill
September the 3rd of fifteen thirteen
We met the English at Flodden Hill
God knows we gave it all
A damned day I saw many fall
I stood with my king and he fought like hell
Pierced with arrows he finally fell
With the king fell Scotland's Pride
A damned day so many died
My fingers touch the solid stones
Strong and cold they keep me from home
Imprisoned like a wingless dove
Far away from the land I love
Lonely days count lonely years
I have cried a thousand tears
All that I tried to gain
Is lost the effort was in vane
At Carberry hill I lost my crown
My husband fled my luck went down
In England's hands I fell
18 years a living hell
The Scottish crown belongs to me
Yet I'm bound I can not flee
With iron claws England holds tight
All is lost no chance to fight
Silence  Silence Everywhere
Cold walls are my reward
Loneliness engulfs my soul
I've been true i gave my heart
Stained tears i cried
I long to be free again
To walk in peace again
Scotland cries her queen is lost
Agony's her friend again
Tonight I had a weird dream
I saw a demon eating men
he crushed Skulls to dust
His eyes filled with a black lust
The demon rules the battlefield
Religion rules with pain and steel
God is love
Hell is open
Searching for the truth
Searching for eternal life
Searching for the truth
You reach heaven but you're
Headed for hell
I've seen brother fighting brother
I've seen friends kill each other
Love is preached to manking
Just believe death you'll find
My king won another crown  for Scotland's pride
That is what we thought but we were not right
Now he rules in London  a faceless king
Sold his ancient kingdom to the enemy
Five laws
You gave at Perth
Betray the rights
We gained by birth
Cry cry cry cry for freedom
The heritage of centuries  you did betray
The blood of Bruce flowing in your veins
Freedom may be lost now and forever more
You gain a crown
We pay the price
You think you rule
But we will rise
By God's Grace
I'm the ing
James the 7th
Obey or death I bring
I hunt the Convenanters down
The Wigtownshire martyrs drown
Sixteen eighty five
The Black Year
Killing time
Believe in me or you must die
Killing time
Hang the victims hang them high
James Stewart reigns
Blood on his hands
His people tortured
By his own commands
Revolution sweet revenge
Hunt the tyrant off the throne
Sixteen eighty eight
The fall of The House of Stewart
Killing time
Kill the tyrant he must die
Killing time
Hang the victims hang them high
Rumours know that rebellion will break out
crown no doubt
Armed and ready stand
My rights I must defend
Steel is in my hand
The clan's are marching `gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory i will find
Rebellion on my mind
The town of Edinburgh fell soon in our hands
Defeated the English at the Battle of Prestopans
I walk alone through burning towns
My sword is in my hand
But the battle has been lost
And there is nothing to defend
At Culloden in seventeen forty six
Scotland's fate was sealed
We wrote a bloody history
Wounds that never healed
Fight for death or glory
Fight at Culloden Muir
Die in pain and anger
Die in pain and anger
I still see Gillis MacBean
Standing wounded from the fight
Back to the wall he fought
And thirteen Redcoats died
But the Clans were beaten and destroyed
Their wives are raped in shame
Prince Bonnie's on the fight again
The rising was in vane
We were a people free and brave
Heroes stood tall
But history is merciless
Now we are to doomed to fall
The battle of Culloden
The end of Scotland
As we raise our swords to the sky
We destroy we defy
Fight to die
As we rise our swords to the sky
Vengeance is our life live to die
Endless battles we give our blood
We sacred warriors we fight for our lands
but we want more
We want to conquer the world
We fight but we're not immortal
Only warfare is immortal
Only warfare is immortal
We're looking for power and might
We want to rule
Our duty is to kill and destroy
Steal treasures rape women
Our only god is Satan
We live to kill we fight to die
We live to fight we fight to die
The black unicorn is our emblem
When you see it on top of the muntain
This is the sign of victory
Then we return but our enemies can't wait
We have to go back to warfare
Into hell's well
Beyond the edge of the black forest
Where trees burn where birds and wolves
Servants of Lucifer sing satanic incantations
Here's the gate to hell's well
Here's the beginning of your pain
If you fall into hell's well
thousands of fallen angels servants of Lucifer
will drink your blood eat your flesh and offer
your soul to their master the bringer of light
This is your slow going to Hell
Into Hell's well Lucifer will damn your soul
Now you're haunting Hell's well
You are a fallen angel
If you fall into Hell's well
The seventh cross will be your emblem
Blood will be your wine
And Lucifer your master
Dark shadows over the graves
Deep silence only whispers
The Angel of Death is calling my name
Strange feelings I'm gonna die
Midnight in the graveyard
The Black Lady Queen of Hell
Wants me as her bloody lover
She's drawing me into the grave
I can't resist
Dead leaves over the path
I'm frozen I must die in the name of Hell
Midnight in the graveyard
The Black Lady is rising from death
She's taking my soul
Black candles around my grave
Light up the shadow of the lady like a ghost
Queen of carnal pleasure
She takes me into the grave
I'm her eternal lover
Midnight in the graveyard
Oh my lady let me die
I've crossed a pact with Satan
When funeral pyres ablaze the black moon sky
Seven newborn children I've to kill
Seven chalices with blood I have to fill
Before the sun rises again
Under the blazing sjy the barbarian horde
Sons of Lucifer await blood
Bloodthirst
Then they will return to hell
I've crossed a pact with Satan
He gave me power and might
Wealth and imortality
So holy weakings be scared
I will desecrate you all
Now I'm your master
I've crossed a pact with Satan
When funeral pyres ablaze the black moon sky
Seven newborn children I've to kill
Seven chalices with blood I have to fill
But if I break the oath
To Hell I will go
In flames I will die
Diabolical sorcerer open the grave
Diabolical sorcerer draw the magic circle
Diabolical sorcerer unearth the dead
Ravens clouding the woods
Filling up the air with lugubrious melodies
The forest is all darkness
Only one dreadful red light
Showing the eyes of Hell
Devilish litanies coming uo and down
Sometimes with laughs sometimes with tears
The ravens are cawing annoucing the beginning
of the ceremony
I conjure you Spirit of Hell to arise
In the name of all the powers of Hell
Diabolical sorcerer now you're satisfied
Diabolical sorcerer give the reward
Diabolical sorcerer let them burn
to ashes and rest for eternity
The fire is up the hill
with your mighty sword
Glory to war glory to the immortal warrior
Listen to the messenger
drink the blood of victory weaking have to die
Death and destruction your only might
Glory to the war glory to the immortal warrior
As the sun beyond the eastern mountains
Beyond the dark seas The Shadows of Massace
The Flames of Conquest the Wrath of Warfare
Honour the son of the mighty god of war
The Immortal Warrior
Under the thunderstorm under the lighting
The white wolf is roaring to death
Like sign of evil gudied by lust and blood
He's wandering the black mountain
Searching for a bloody sacrifice
White wolf King of Darkness
Majesty of Blood Guardian of the Black Mountain
The full moon is up
Thirsty for blood the white wolf obeys Satan
The Lord of fire his master
White wolf allegory od sacrifice and death
Torture and pain and starvation
The forest deep and dark
The mountain balck and cold
His territory for devilish sacrifices
White wolf King of Darkness
Majesty of Blood Guardian of the Black Mountain
Darkness cold wind storm and fire
Call the white wolf
And the sacrifice shall begin
Like a call from the deepest darkness
Touch me three times with your magic wand
I will tell you the tale my lord
The one about the apocalypse
No more sun no more dreams
Only dark desert and cold lands
The stars will die the moon will be frost
Invisible forcers will keep you
Burning in the endless fire
But there is that other one
Who's name is never pronounced
Banished form Hell from every kingdom
From every book
When time comes for the throes of death
He will be the apocalyptic king
The sword piercing your heart
He will bewitch your mind
He will keep you awake
In fear and the unknown
I can't explain you won't understand
The dream is gone the falling deep
Under the spell spoken in tongues
In the colors of Hell
In the ringing that chimes inside me
So drag me down deeper still
Poison the poison the poison
Poison the poison the poison demon
I am lost again everything's gone
And more alone than I ever have been
Out of my mind and down on my knees
I'm losing more than I'll ever get
And even if you want to you can't ever help me
Nor can I ever hope to reach you
But I love to fall Need the rush
Poison the poison the poison
Poison the poison the poison devil
I am down again everything lost
And more gone than I ever have been
I'm not here to stay not made to last
Total destruction is the way for me
And when I kill I kill
When I kill I really kill
Yeah when I kill I kill
Treachery I will betray you all
With a poisoned kiss filled with deceit
Smiling turning my back
And leaving you all behind
In chaos and drunk in desperation
Trying to escape this meaningless life
A child of death playing with fire
So sing for my soul 'cause I cannot be saved
Poison the poison the poison
Poison the poison the poison god
Behold your grave deep screaming and insane
Beneath the ground your corpse will rot away
The thief of life the silent bird of prey
So where will you go and what will you do
When death is coming knocking at your door
You can cry and pray wish it all away
But death is coming knocking down your doors
My soul is still my own it's free but I am caged
Black sky above  Evil is alive
Soon you'll see what will be
The great demise of those undefied 
May nothing be their epitaph
You  Can you explain the coming sorrows
And see beyond the gates of eternity
You  Can you explain the coming terrors
And find the reason behind this mystery
Free your soul and let me be gone
Free your soul and let me be gone
Free your soul and let me be gone
Free your soul and let me be gone
My soul is still my own it's free but I am caged
Black sky above  Evil is alive
Soon you'll see what will be
The great mysteries of death revealed
And nothing is there at the end
In the year 1999 and seven months
From the sky shall come the great King of Terror
Attack
Burning skies devastation the time has come
The true face of Satan a terrible storm of fire
A monster of power and energy
Total release of the starving anger
Rising across the world
On wings of death the fed on famine
The Apocalypse unleashed
1999  Revolution 666
1999  Revolution 666
The year 2000 marks the new beginning
Must tear down to recreate
The death of the old is the birth of the new
It can't go on like this forever
Something must happen  Something must die
Unity and pride strength in numbers
Nothing to lose but the chains that bind us
Raise our fists and rise against
Awakening of the beast inside
1999  Revolution 666
1999  Revolution Blood shall flow
Ahahaha And your pretty world is going to Hell
Welcome to Planet Satan

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law
No limit the law
And oh I'm hating you like I've always hated you

Welcome to the dying of the heart
The path of pure damnation
The dark horse will bring glory
The pale horse will bring death
Now in the House of Deadly Dreams
I have seen the truth of me
It is finished
Back again in the symbolic winter night
I will leave you dead in dreams
Laughing in triumph in bitter passion
Weltering in blood cruelty and nameless pain
But killing you is killing me
And dead I shall till the end of my time remain
I'll tear you down and make you look at me
I have no soul my face turned to a mask
Cold winds of death blow straight into my heart
I'll tear you up and rob you of your life
My dying heart can't hold when sorrow detonate
Watch out
The night is magic metalelectric
Your mind goes manic wild and satanic
In flashing lights and violent sound
Where bodies rain and faces scream
God Shock  Devil Lust
Electric night
Come and let those fuckin' demons out now
Let it out  Come let yourself go  Go insane
Driven to insanity I am what you think
Adrenaline rush going totally blind
Energy aggression mayhem and chaos
Harder and faster ain't gonna give in
An explosion of deathnoise a shockwave of power
This is the way we take our revenge
God Shock  Devil Rock
Electric storm
Come and let it blow your mind away now
Loudest shit you've ever heard

No future baby we're going down
But I'll always remember those electric nights
God Shock  Demon Rush

Let Him in
And let's raise some Hell tonight
Hell tonight let it burn
Let Him in
And let's raise some Hell tonight
Hell tonight let us fuckin' burn
Roar of distant thunder breaks the summer breeze
Deep waters arising tidal waves unleash
The wind has now turned into a storm
Panic in your eyes frightened you realize
There is no escape from the earth
Armageddon has come it has only just begun
And there is no god above to hear you cry
Shattered heaven
Great comets are coming all animals going insane
The sun burns hypnotic blue
Faster and faster till the center cannot hold
The end of the world is true
Now the final fire explodes across the horizon
As your eyes are totally blackened out
The coming dark age of a world in fright
Armageddon has come it has only just begun
And there is no god above to hear you cry
Now the final fire explodes across the horizon
As your eyes are totally blackened out
He is the Fallen the Desolate One
The castaway banished in darkness
When I am betrayed and left all alone
I can feel His call in my soul
The calling for me to stand as proud as Him
The Devil and the darkness
He is my weapon my rage and my sword
The spirit of total revolt
They say that He's evil then evil I am
Committing each sin with a smile
My enemies are those who try to rule my life
Follow my dream in the shadow of death
The calling of Hell the calling of Satan
Follow my dream in the shadow of death
The calling of Hell the calling of Satan
Dream death Hell Satan
Dream death Hell
The Devil and the darkness
Prince Loneliness  You hated one
Vengeance be thy name thy kingdom to come
Destruction be done in heave as it is on earth
So that I never shall bow my head down
Son of Fire spread your wings
And the victory shall be ours
And the glory  And the power
Forever  Satan
I charge you I charge you  You cursed Jehovah
And every enemy of spiritual freedom
The sound of my heart is my only law
And my choice is to follow the way of the rebel
Lucifer the fallen lonely Morningstar
shall rise again  The Day of Revenge is at hand
Follow my dream in the shadow of death
The calling of Hell the calling of Satan
Follow my dream in the shadow of death
The calling of Hell the calling of Satan
Dream death Hell Satan
Dream death Hell
The Devil and the darkness
You have seen me fall fall from grace
Now watch me rise rise against you all fuckers
Now it's time for you to be afraid of the dark
Hunting my life is war and now I'm pissed
Fighting you better keep out of my sight
Enemy I'm gonna strike you with naked fist
Can't you see what your lies have done to me
In for the kill
You rule the world but I can't see a reason why
In for the kill
Don't you try  Don't you try to bring me down
In for the kill
Primed for hate prepared to fight I'm gonna win
I'll give you
Prowling like the insane hungry starving wolf
Hiding Outside your window in the black
Wanting you're like the little wellfed lamb
Can't you see what your lies have done to me
In for the kill
You rule the world but I can't see a reason why
In for the kill
Don't you try  Don't you try to bring me down
In for the kill
Primed for hate prepared to fight I'm gonna win
I'll give you Hell
Pray to God and send more cops
Searching the lights go out another dies
Hunting Bringing war I'm drawing near
Fighting This time you're gonna pay the price
Suit  tie I'll make you scream in naked fear
Can't you see what your lies have done to me
In for the kill
You rule the world but I can't see a reason why
In for the kill
Don't you try  Don't you try to bring me down
In for the kill
Primed for hate prepared to fight I'm gonna win
I'll give you Hell
Come into my room I bid you welcome
To show you my world and yours to explore
You want to know danger feel the lashing of skin
And taste blood on the lips of a kiss
The shadow in my smile
The powers there to find
The glitter of death
In my eyes
Reality dies hot bodies pulsing
Time is destroyed in sexual magic
Grabbing your hair unashamed lust
And you're begging me to
Can you feel it deeper down
How I am fucking your soul
Deeper down
Fucking your body and soul
Hand in hand with pain and pleasure
Winds of sin at my sails
Sailing the seas of satanic dreams
Sinking through the waves of orgasmic rush
To another plane in the spirit world
And down into your endless depths
And the chaos comes crashing down
Do you know the shadow in my smile
And the powers there to find
And can you see the glitter of death in my eyes
Feel it deeper down
How I am fucking your soul
Deeper down
Fucking your body and soul
Body and soul flesh and blood
Heart and mind spirit and seed
From the depth of my soul
Body and soul flesh and blood
Heart and mind spirit and seed
Flesh and blood heart and mind
Feel me in your soul flesh and blood
Heart and mind deeper in your soul
Brains decay but the engine's still roaring
Yeah I'm high but Christ is not no
The maladjusted the scum of the earth
You're only food for the bitter harvest
The snake fights fools
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth
Come on let's kill this parasite
So does the bastard live in me still
I walked unto the altar and I saw the fear
Won't you take my hand God  I'm your son
And fuck you hard because you always want more
All hail the Nazarene rotten to the core
Attack paradise
And rape angel white
To be mastermind
Just cut all gods' tongues
A tight grip on me
Ha ha I burn in Hell
No one makes me slave
God remains insane
Burden of no taste
Life's reality
If I had a choice 
I would cease to be
But can death destroy
The Hero of Hate
Reborn addicted 
Let my blood go free
Free
Slavestate birth
The unstoppable forces in everywhere
For heaven lives only in your head
Worship fools
The storm of sin you can't resist
Weak fate Go down
The mystery man lurks in the dead man's heart
Jesus loves you
Feel the time
It grows in you it feeds off you
Burns down dreams
Kills the life that you have left to live
Fear the one
Who offers you inner peace
Hell within you
You come down with blood on your face
Hear he's closer
Prepare to accept your end
Shadows surround you
Shed a tear for the ones you hold dear
Oh by my side you walk and smile when people die
You're Death
Death by my side
Hell within you
Uncontrolled cause of split desire
Crush a vein
Feel death flow under your skin
Death by my side
On by my bed you wake and wait to take my hand
You're Death
Death by my side
Convulsing worlds in its consequence 
Yet dainty and smooth in its motion 
Veritable only in a glimpse
Barely perceptible movements from the centre 
Point out the changeability of the instances 
Monuments constructed for ages 
Incrementally staggering
Former reliability becomes unreckonable 
Abstracted mere from the steady course of time 
Wearing the countenance of unease as a mask 
What was once familiar sheds its face
A perpetual motion machine of alteration 
The fostering gale can no longer be denied 
Long ago has belittlement lost its sense 
Still grief and paralysis canalize the force 
Impelled squarely by sobered lucidity 
We humbly walk a foregone way
Ratios thoughts ordaining your cubicle
The secured wrapped path dwindles
Veering mazed in a ring
My confidant undertow  whereto
Welcome my sanctimonious friend
Plunge in ineffable truthfulness
Unknowing but foolish
Feed the sea with your dreams
Omnipotent amplitudes coupled with hope
Lower sharpened with yearning
A blackened warped picture
Gobbling your boastfulness
Timeless depths conjuring fameless
Fly my prideful jester
Unreal glances nail of distress of your entity
Embedded in an unenslaved range
As the light fades
And hope evades
When darkness descends
And all joy ends
When dreams turn to dust
When life seems unjust
All colours turn to grey
And illusions melt away
When trust is betrayed
And frustration ambuscades
When friends turn to foes 
And the walls echo your woes
When dark clouds cover the sun
And the last shelter is gone
When you`re naked facing the storm
And all you get is fleer and scorn
When forebodements haunt your dreams
And your deepest fears are redeemed
You creep back into your cave
Hide yourself and hope to feel safe
When nightmares turn real
And pain is all that you feel
On a permanent escape
But there`s none and that`s your fate
Yet a new crack of dawn draws near
Autumn taking in
But I know that's not the cause
Halting reclusion drags me down
This life hesitates to be enjoyed
Not the slightest prospect of change
Vicious circle 
That I'd thought to have escaped
A lasting state of worry prolongs
Another mirthless year goes by
Another hopeless day
In another mirthless life
Regarding life's blithenesses
Like unattainable jewels in the display
Full of yearning
Yet aware they can't be mine
Grievously sensible 
That sudden griping feel
All activates irrelevant
An existence most fatally reduced
Conversant becomes that state of mind
Forming my personality
The longly missed pass of being spared
Falls into oblivion
Are witnesses of trickled felicitousness
Weigh floods on your mind
 Restless eyes crying soundless
Dried up herbage coated with glory
Of distressing transformation 
Drill clefts into transitoriness				
 Seething tears of your reality
Opressed hankering for redemption
Straitjacket of your soul
Solidifying floes to the fire				
 Raving in uncontrolled stagnation
Misty adumbrations laughing wise
Penned up in the infinite cosmos
Strange birds of prey circulate idly			
 Mystifying messengers of consolation
Hide in your cocoon
No occasion to crave
No one reaches you
Entangled in a plexus of fundamental lies
I simply can't imagine any other way 
This play must be screened off
Before they smell the bogus 
Driven by desperation 
Only an attempt to escape 
Abysmally desponded  
The shame is even stronger
Than the menacing fear
Of what awaits beyond
All affairs completed
Left you one last gasp 
Helplessly raising your arms 
You will watch me sliding
Down
Into my secret silence
Down
Into my silent void
Agonizing remorse follows my redemption
Terminating my ailment has destroyed much more
Don't ever try to fathom
Don't search for causes
Don't you try to join me
Don't escort me going
Down
Into my secret silence
Down
Into my silent void
Come alone horrid eyes
Bone from bone sigh to sigh
In all dying there is a certain beauty
To travel the seas of temptation
And the velvet skies of pain
Sodomize the sacred in the velvet skies of pain
Lightning the fuse of death
We march towards the twilight
In apocalypse and pain
Never to see the light of day again
And when the birds of burning flesh return
Sweet child I wish you were dead
Sweet child I wish you were dead
Dry your eyes now little one
Shut up and listen hear the screams in the night
Rage of fire
Rage in the night
Dry your eyes now little one
My rage grows stronger so burn
Like a hunted child alone
Face my demons of falling desire
Rage of fire
Rage in the night
Dry your eyes now little one
The flames get higher so burn
Look up to the sky
Do you see the flaming eyes watching you
Can you feel their anger
Let the madness lead you
No compass on this earth
Shows my direction
Voids of death and misery
Soon we'll have our victory
Withering the bliss of gods
we wandered dared and won
Rise and shine in the night
My pride salutes me until I fall
The wicked children praise my name
then writes it in the morning sky
All litlle devils are dancing in ecstacy
Inspired by the taste of horror
Proud to be insane forever
Proud to be insane
Let out the killer in me
Raise your hands above your head
Close your eyes and you'll be dead
Broken dreams of insanity
Anger will be my victory
Inspired by the taste of horror
Proud to be insane forever
Proud to be insane
Let out the killer in me
The healing nails sting my bleeding heart
Takes my breath away
Tear myself apart
The little girl in my bed has a gun to my head
Looks into my eyes
And says she want me dead
I'm not a boyscout
I'm a lunatic
Lunatic
The bitch is dead
Lunatic
The bitch is dead
The fat lady sings tonight
That voice disgust me
I'm not a boyscout
I'm a lunatic
I ride the psycho path in pain
Into the foreign shores
I'll never walk again
Just call my name and I will be your enemy
Just call my name and I won't be answering
I will be your enemy until the darkness fall
Blinded by the morning light
I'm not afraid to die
Eat my flesh and drink my soul
it's no use holding on
Feed my dreams with your own soil
Let me feel your pain
Come watch the acid sights I see
Crawling up towards me
Do they want me well
I ride the psycho path to gain
The power that the sane never will obtain
Just call my name then I will be your enemy
Just call my name and I will be insane
Shine for me misery
Devils rapture their coils
Suffer the fathomless end
Until we parche with sermons again
Strangle me slowly
Enter my palace of pain
Cover your screams
'Cause the wind will carry all your words away
Pass me the bottle
Pass me the venomous wine
Pass me this deadly brew
And I will drink and die again
Shine for me lust and thorns
Compromise carven in suns
Hatred of my own feet
I will never be able to walk this ground again
The rain has waited too long too long
Shine for me Misery
Seen vagely from this dim and misty place
Words like hunted flesh
They return again and again
Calling up the stirs of pain
Walking down those stairs again
I am barely the shadow of my former self 'cause
I NO LONGER CARE
FUCK YOU ALL OUT THERE
We've crowned a king with no soul
When all doors are closed we walk alone
We know you've seen us you always did
And every time you close your eyes
You make us fade
Don't you ever wonder if we sleep at night
If we sit in silence you think you're right
In the end you were never right
You were never right
We are crowned by our errors
And we're lost in the lone
Dare not look in the mirror
We've crowned a king with no soul
We have lost this to silence
There's no one left to fault
Dare not look in the mirror
'Cause it's full of holes
We have lost this to silence
There's no one left to fault
Dare not reach out and falter
When no one's left to call
Dare not reach out I falter
Cannot stand all your laughter
Reach out and touch me
You'll need to scream loud to reach me
Brought into this world
Met by open arms
See I was born as hero
But deep inside this kingdom
I know that that's untrue
Given to many reasons
Lost my faith in you
Civitas
Civitas diablo
On and on we rise we fall
This king is crowned by errors
Lost right to the throne
So place your crown of errors
Your kingÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂno soul
On and on we rise we fall
I need to see
See the inside of me
Straight into the depth to unlock it all
To set all free
I know you fell the same
Today I lost my way
Becoming numb must wake a change
I used to live to stray
I used to choose the easy way
Becoming numb must wake a change
Becoming numb must wake a change
Must wake a change
Must rise to wake a change
'Cause no one knows our hearts
Not as well as us that's what keeps us apart
Distant
But we'll conquer anything
Defeat this world that make us slave
Becoming numb must wake a change
Must wake a change
Must rise to wake a change
So if we're not keeping silent
If we just let it surface
Something surely comes to set us free
We're not keeping silent
Must defeat the words that make us slave
Leave this world that makes us hurt
Becoming numb must wake a change
Becoming numb must wake a change
Must wake a change
Deep down inside of me
Deep into infinity
Here it lies the birth of me
And here it dies 'cause you're hurting me
And you just keep breathing me
And I just keep bleeding through
You rule no longer
The kingdom's ours and growing stronger
We rise
'Cause nothing's the same
You hide when no one's to blame
We rise from ashes and stone
There's no remedy
We rise
'Cause nothing's the same
You hide when no one's to blame
We rise from ashes and stone
We're the shells that have lost the capacity
Both to suffer to breathe and to bleed free
There's no remedy
There's no remedy
We rise
'Cause nothing's the same
You hide when no one's to blame
We rise from ashes and stone
Do you ever think it's over
That we already lost
We'll never be convinced to change
Do you ever feel it's over
We are the ones with too fast beating hearts
The ones who won't say that we are lost
But we have been fighting for much too long
We're getting tired
'Cause we have been watching our comrade's fall
So we throw ourselves with open arms
These open wounds and open palms
You watched and left us all to bleed
Drained these veins for all to see
But we're not falling
No
We are the ones with too fast beating hearts
The ones who won't say that we are lost
I threw myself at heaven's arms
And wore my open wounds to see
You swore yourself to me
You swore yourself to me
But we have been fighting for much too long
We're getting tired
'Cause we have been watching our comrade's fall
And we have been fighting for much too long
We're getting tired
We're longing to see
The barricades fall
Only breath in the darkness
Feels like a black undertow
Only breath in the darkness
Let what is left just unfold
Freedom unfold
Feels like a black undertow
Free
Unfold like a black undertow
The morning mist chase the night away
But inside this heart it never strays it stays
I know the swings how he tumbles how he sways
Freedom at last
Feels like a black undertow
Free
On hold
Like a black undertow
We're still in this together
Still in this together
Still in this together
Freedom on hold
Feels like a black undertow
Free
Unfold like a black undertow
I came with the harvest
I flew with the flames
We are the same
The black seeds of autumn
And cold winter rain
We are the same
Come
Come tear us open
Always felt that it was us not you
I am broken in two
Come tear us open
Always felt that it was me not you
I now that I'm broken
I'm broken not broken not spoken to
Not spoken to
Six months have passed now
We're weary we're cold
Are the fires the same
Still burning the same
Is the fire the same
Is the fire the same
So we came during autumn and left with the snow
Come
Come tear us open
Always felt that it was me not you
I now that I'm broken
I'm broken not broken not spoken to
Not spoken to
I need to disappear
Devoured and forgotten
Gotta hurry these lands
Before it is too dark to see
I have to disappear
Reach out show me how you feel the same
Scream loud these hymns are for the broken
Hey you know me my every turn
Hey you see me in front of you Ill never hurt
Hey hear me it is time I learn
Hey I know youre watching me
Setting fires to the sea winds I burn
Reach out show me how you feel the same
Scream loud these hymns are for the broken
I need to disappear
Devoured and forgotten
Got to hurry these lands
Before it is too dark to see
I have to disappear
Reach out show me how you feel the same
Scream loud these hymns are for the broken
I missed you since forever
I longed for you when I was hurt
Longed so long I can't remember
Were there ever days of heaven
Replace this pain with something new
Magic thoughts of white turned blue
I'm clinging to what seems a tale
Searching for the Holy Grail
And I've been missing you forever
And I've been missing you forever
Grand brushes of white and blue
Where one is Me
And one is you
Hope of highs soon joined by lows
And thoughts of why last sung by bows
That fire arrows that land in snow
Wake up hollow
Replace this pain with something new
Magic thoughts of white turned blue
I'm clinging to what seems a tale
Searching for the Holy Grail
And I've been missing you forever
We wanted to be caught in dreams that never end
But I will never fell like you
Came so close you I
Came so close you I
Came so close you I
Came so close you I
We fall like feathers
We fall forever
And we know you see us all
But do you really see the fall
The grand of I collapse
To contradict the past
So I'm sad time does not heal
And I wait and I drink while I bleed
I understand that we must leave
And I wait while I bleed
Time to leave
So we set sail on open seas
Where no one's known and no one's seen
We cruised forever
Without a lead of how to steer a ship that bleed
I one day hope the sun gives way
To rid the clouds that hides our way
If we could only strand on shores
Where I am safe but still so sore
And I remember the winds of autumn breeze
Still remember the days when we played kings
It's December
You can't silence the screams
And I remember a light to darkness change
And I remember
Pitch black and without sunshine rays
A noble grief stirred heart always ready to die
In sinister systematisation submission is golden
He was like an object that is being processed
A forcefed destructor ready for abomination
The vast solitude in him witnessed it all
Those self afflicting eyes
And their fear painted faces
Hosts to oblivion
Exploring the darkest of places
Stench of rotten flesh breathing down his neck
Every day seemed like an endless night
When would he ever wake from this void
No other voice than his own will ever tell
What was real and where he had been
What he had done
Did you bleed for the cause
Like the rest of his men
Did you capture the euphoria
How it was like to kill
Such a necromantic force behind it all
They sure did battle till the end
But when came all the glory
And who got spared to carry his body
Just pure death and too profound to be shared
Was it all a fabricated vision in his memory
To serve the wastelands of insanity
At the front
Life forever lost its innocence
Never to see the light of day again
He pondered his last few steps
Into the realms of death
With his hands bloodstained
Courage and consistency
Bravery and valor
Honor and pride
For what was it all worth
The battle raged on and on
Fuelled by the venom of hatred for man
Consistently without the eyes to see
By those who revel in sewer equally
We the prosperity of the future seal
Cloaked by the thunders of the north wind
Born to capture the essence of
The trails of our kind
Zero tolerance must be issued forth
Behind the enemy's line
So it shall be written
And so it shall be done
Discover and conceive the secret wealth
And pass it unto your breed
Become your own congregation
Measure the sovereignty of it's invigoration
We who not deny the animal of our nature
We who yearn to preserve our liberation
Are we not the undisputed prodigy of warfare
Fearing all the mediocrity that they possess
Consider the god we could be without the grace
Once and for all
Once and for all
Annihilate
The commotion breeding the perverse
For bloodbath is on your doorstep
A mass impending threat
The perfection of religion
Becoming our death
Do not respond blindly
To growing gardens in decay
Stand guard when visitors fall silent
Blow the candles out end the road here
No solace will be found
Within elements of the tribe
When covered with filth from all sides
Compassion will fail
Their promises are honored
In a mind controlled state
The absence of reality reason and logic
Prove failure of faith
Enriched by the presence of it's clarity
Darkness descends everyone dies
For wisdom aligns in our favor
Illuminated before our eyes
Uncover
A new beginning the inevitable dawn
Justice will be given where justice is due
And guide the righteous ones
Back to the final resting ground
To perceive the truly hellbound
Demonstrate superiority
Demons rate inferiority
Scatter the remains of the prey
Rise up
Let us fight
The thought away from our backs
And seed
On a cursed land
A lineage of pain
Then to burden
The  of the merciful
Who believe in
The bread of the soulless
For the faith you posses
Is nothing but disgust and arrogance
And your need for knowledge
Is an abundance of mockery and desecration
The pain in my heart is not thirst
For a heavenly body
Nor is the failing search for angelic power
It is the fire and it burns
It's just that you
Are in its way
Take part in the shadow of guilt
Please your soul with the wonders of sin
For where will you be
When the lamp is extinguished
But death comes not
With our message
Reverberations from the splendid inheritance
Will redeem the eternal corruption
Bring judgement over heads other than your own
Where you hide your shame in songs of praise
Then you shall taste the fruit
Of your own passing away
Like a flock of hellspawns
And stewards of the son of despite
By the evidence of our heavy burden
Lies their mind drowning
Left dessicated without power
Let us sit by and watch
Death and destruction's devotees revel
Let us sit back and witness
Innocent semen being poured
Into the arms of Armageddon
Let it pour more and more
Pure fucking Armageddon
Let it pour more and more
Reason faithfully defiles
On bloodstained hands
Where graceful motion
Are lost arts
There are only battles to be lost
In the kingdoms of the blind
For those who seek salvation
In the dust of the earth
Will only find wrath
In the sands of time
Engulfed by the desert
We taste death in the dry heat
The disciples of prophetic ablution
Had sworn to let the skeptics bleed
For great are their love for warfare
Henchmen of the disastrous creed
Watch us all celebrate in their name
The lambs of our time being slain
Awaiting the final perdition
Defeat against all and everything
For whatever adorned righteousness
For mankind so hated the world
That whoever believed the lie
To perish and receive everlasting hell
Man and his faithful ethics
Intoxicated by the fruits of the earth
Diabolical fanatikism so cold and grim
The perfect perversion bestiality incarnate
As instruments of torture
And leaving no room for sympathy
We bring forth the monstrous birth
To the worlds light
As all great art is made from suffering
So are we
Good in nature but evil by our own free will
Incestuously created by the will to kill
Time is here to walk the final abyss march
Bound to the force of the last holocaust
Pour free the gifts of grace
And slaughter the entire human race
Not permitted to redemption
When pain rises high in purgatory
A reality so convincingly justified
Feeding from Death Cult's gown
We bring forth monstrous birth
To the worlds light
Unclean is the unfolding and thought of the act
Without limitations in unknown ecstasy
Voluntary infected and soaked with acid
In fleshy sweetness
Imprisoned by lies and disobedience
Man's fragile behaviour
Must be strained with honor and glory it's told
But goodness brought nothing but eternal evil
When the tyrant of Eden granted the fruit
When heaven's glorious injustice
And pompous mercy
Invokes discardment as we are seen
The spark has started a fire
And suffering in the will of pestilence
The pathetic slaves kneeling in shame
Born with sin and mercy
Descendants who swear the oath
With a promise to undo the peace
To crush the richness of heaven's slaves
And triumph in coldness in honor of the Beast
The chalice of wrath is flowing over
Strengthened by rioting devils' sulphur winds
Glowing from the region of Belial's children
Bred beyond the defying mountains of indignation
The last signs of Christ's losing angels
Burning inexorably in the fire of the raven
Painful and pale is death
With haematemesis from the guild of light
Death's presence spares no one
The devout life is suffocated by its own tongues
The most precious soil is garnished
With poverty and hunger
Wings spanned over Darkness' deep abyss
Brought to life to devour
With pestilence and death
Indulging on sin and whorery
The supremacy of the bastards of the pole
Finds pleasure in the hierarchy of sin
An eternal life in paradise
Is perfection in Satan's dynasty
Are you born from the abyss
And have you sought the creed
That drape the shadows
Of your own thought
Is your heart mesmerized
By the fire that burns forevermore
And do the secrets from the flames
Hold the mysteries over which you preside
Reveal the infantile wound and regain strength
Free your spirit from those who lead in praise
Recollect the anger and the hate
For not shall your morals dissolve in pity
Righteous warmth accompanied
By deceitful tongues
Stay away from processed promises
Let them fear what you know
A malicious smile on their lips
To keep us all under control
Now it's time to rise and demand our due
Better lead than being led earn any victory
The burden of proof rests on your shoulders
As mortal manufactured waste
And part of the commonly infected
You prevent the ones worthy the gift of life
To surface on once a prosperous soil
As superficially bewildered whores
And succumbing to fictional truth
You are taught to preserve and profit
The life institutional lie
You worthless piece of shit
May we all depart from this world
And dissolve into nothingness
Compassion will not be granted
When life's value
Is point below zero
Human depravity is at our disposal
As the perfect tool to destroy mankind
The worst kind of them all
Modern times' ignorance the world disease
Appeal to death of every man
A living hate smoldering abyss
Seeks the easiest way to the feed the engine
Praising the final bloodbath
Uncertainty and guilt
Will no longer endorse our fate
There will be no remorse we kill to kill again
Killing all
Go ahead end it all we deserve no better
As a forever unblessed detonation
The great plutonium chord fulminates
Blinding the eyes of creation
Cutting off all life support
Sweeping away existence instantly
Iced desolate ruins linger
Leaving traces of our lovely humanity
The memories far beyond the reckoning
Have begun to lurk in the distance
Like visual objects dearly known
The grace of devils hands
As they walk with me like a medium
When I choose and require a burnout
Resting in expanded malicious force
Drained for murderous weapons
Knowing where you stand
In the magnitude of this thought
Looking at the spirit of fire and flames
Enduring on the throne of the black heart
A bringer of evil I am
And therefore also a carrier of light
As I use this focus through the dark
And face the sunshine in the dead end
Limitations do not exist
When you are ahead of the crowd
With the art of confidence
I reign at the throne of my soul
The value of this darkness unwinds
Travelling the other path
A hidden triumph
But obvious to the strong and wise
By understanding this reality
I remain in a twicecoloured cloud
With feet connected solid in the ground
And thus I get peace of mind
A bringer of evil I am
And also a carrier of light
As I use this focus through the dark
And face the sunshine in the dead end
Devoted to your own opiate
In escapades from discontentment
Are you shutting off from the outside world
To reflect on your mind shallow gutter
For this is your empire this is your intrigue
Here you own them all here you seal the deed
Contaminated from the spree of self salvation
To keep the fever flowing in the veins
Prominently manipulating heaven and hell
Does your sophistically discreet interlude
Maintain stories not to be revealed
In your search for redemption
Greed and lies become the savior
Through the lecherous eyes disgust withstand
For are not these the windows to your soul
Fatherly fornication of sweat lips in dismay
Repeatedly unlocking the vaults to the holocaust
But it will never never gain the strength
A surrender in superficial scorn
The rape of an ever unborn
Seeds have been planted in the name of the son
Until this day ungodliness is yet to be gone
The only way to comfort the defeat
Regrets can no longer find it's ways
Mirrored in the haze of a partaker's eyes
Satan My Master
I slit my wrists to drain me of my blood
Satan My Master
Up side down I turn the cross of God
Satan My Master
Receive this sacrifice this blood of mine
Satan My Master
I cut into my rotten flesh your signs
Satan My Master
Remember me when judgement day is near
Satan My Master
For all of those who said it could never be done
This is for you
Tormented by my every undying devotion for you
I have destroyed myself
This time it was all or nothing
I struck the match and turned away
Torch the fields and pray for rain
I have entered the eye of your storm
A pause in affliction
Cut the cord bring the plague
Start again
Ash to ash dust to dust
Start again
I'd give anything to return to nothing
If not forgiven will this all be forgotten
As this guilt will outlive us both
Dear God what have I let myself become
Once again I end up biting the bullet
Don't act surprised by now it's second nature
It happens over and over again
I only bend so far before I break
And in return nothing leaves me satisfied
But it's only a matter of time
Won't be long I smell the fuse burn shorter
And I'm not about to snuff it out
I'll take this head on till the end
Hear my voice no cries for deliverance
I've become the victim of my own defense
And there's no one to blame but myself
As the structure fails
I'll pray for the fall out
For I am what I create
As the embers rise
I'll be at the bottom
When it all comes down
I'll carry the weight of the world
Strapped to my back
I'll carry the weight of the world
Chained to my neck
I'll carry the weight of the world
Drag my face through the dirt again
I know I'm where I belong
For you're a constant reminder
Of all the rights that I've wronged
Give me the strength to move this mountain
To block this line of sight
This was more than I could ask for
Tear down the sky
Black out the sky
Sever these ties
As you further your tragedy
To prove to me you're alive
Sooner or later we'll have to choose
From this a new set of lies
Give me the strength to flood this valley
To wash my hands of you
This was more than I could ask for
Tear down the sky
Black out the sky
Sever these ties
So here I stand
This battered path laid out before me
And no one said this would be easy
But it's something I must do for myself
It's going to be a long hard road
Know I will let go
This time it feels so right to forget
This was more than I could ask for
Tear down the sky
Black out the sky
Sever these ties
So here I stand
This battered path laid out before me
And no one said this would be easy
But it's something I must do for myself
It's going to be a long hard road
Which I will walk alone
No footprints before me
Will I be the one that finds a way
Our fate unfolding
Is there something more then the roles we play
How deep the roots dig
And they sink into my skin
I see myself in the cracks of your foundation
And these walls will crumble by our hands
We don't talk much anymore
And we're not letting down our guard
We are not alone
Everyone is lost
Waiting on a second wind
Just believe we are not alone
Speak to me
What can be said while we're still being honest
Only then will these marks start to heal
And cleanse us of these demons
Take my hand and walk with me
Lead me to salvation
No footprints before me
Will I be the one that finds a way
Feel how deep the roots dig
And they sink into my skin
I see myself in the cracks of your foundation
And these walls will crumble by our hands
No we are not alone
Everyone is lost
Waiting on a second wind
We are not alone
Press rewind
Play it back in this dark room
It's been so long
I don't remember who we used to be
Go slow
Is it safe to come out again
In skin like stone
Now I can't believe anyone anymore
I wasted it on you
They were sinking or swimming
I was floating away
On our own
We see the world now for what its worth
Undo what's done
Before this heart destroys its host
They were sinking or swimming
I was floating away
Reach into her guts
Take back what's tangled up
I wasted it on you
Reach into her guts
We're just rehearsing who we think we are
Embrace this sickness with open arms
If you believe you'll run with ghosts
Pull out the arrows that poison your mind
Look inside and ask yourself why
Why would you really want to live forever
Every breath expelled together
In faith alone in place apart
Be there to meet your maker
Raise your eyes from sleep
Together you will be searching
The answers will never come
And I can't pretend anymore to be a part of this
And I'll leave my burdens at the door
But I'll never walk here again
Our fears ring true
We're on a march towards the end
Cover my eyes
But I still hear the deafening drums of war
Onward every twisted spoke
Let's make history
Let's make history stop
When there's nothing left
We'll be fed our father's dreams
And I find every time I face this skyline
I picture it in ruins
It's not going to stop
Our fears ring true
We are numbered with the dead
When I finally come apart
Every piece will melt holes into the streets
Onward every twisted spoke
Let's make history
Let's make history stop
When there's nothing left
We'll be fed our father's dreams
We can't let it happen like this
Burn it down
Burn it to the fucking ground
It's not going to stop
Revive a sense of hope
Amids these abandoned dreams
Rewrite what it is to feel
In hopes it will carry me home
Drift in and out
The light of morning drags me back
I need release
Separate this body from my mind
Send me home
My conscience there to send me off to sleep
When I need you closer
For when I wake I am greeted by shades of grey
I'll return to you
In dreams the sun sets in our eyes
In dreams we'll never be apart
In dreams I'll promise you'll never be alone
How much I wish your voice could send me home
Panic sets in
The room just spins
Here it comes again
Slipping through my fingers out of my reach
Nothing is picture perfect
Buried under the rocks of a landscape
Nothing here is picture perfect
Slipping through your fingers
It's out of your hands
Bleed
Holding on gets harder and harder
Giving up gets harder and harder
Release
The tension corrupts direction
I've lost control
Slipping through my fingers it's out of my grasp
Nothing is ever be perfect
Crippled by the weight of the downfall
Nothing here is real
Keep control
A lifetime of open wounds
Completely incomplete
Bleed
Holding on gets harder and harder
Giving up gets harder and harder
Release
The tension corrupts direction
I've lost control
The spell is broken
Masked in rituals to capture the sun
Bloodletting
Monuments of guilt
If I had one wish I'd stop all the clocks
Within me the spell is broken
We all are still alive
We radiate
Breathe now
It's in the wind that we give and we take
I have seen them
Within me the spell is broken
Home
At last
Homecoming at last
Now feel what is unseen
Within me the spell is broken
I will fight 'till the day I die
Like I did it before
Fucking killer has no remorse
He still stalkin' along deserted avenues
Blood thirsty demon evil morbid ghost
Develop from the back and brings the gravy frost
I hate music that you listen
Don't try tell me about this shit
Stop talk about that bastards
Stop think about that motherfuckers
You never heard my music on the radio
You never saw my music on the MTV
I'll never never never be a star
Tell me just 'bout you love and hate
Show me what now you create
I're got only my own words
I was born to make this fuckin' music
They said that my music is loud
And just thunder scream and shout
Fuck them all and let'em kiss my ass
I just wanna kill that motherfuckers
Once I had an awful morbid dream
In my mind I heard a cry and scream
All at once I saw the witch from hell
All around me start to chime like bell
Terrible dream cry and scream
I're been so fright
Nowhere to run nowhere to go nowhere to hyde
Can you see my future  Then I told
Do you see me in the crystal ball
Yes'she saidyour fate not by your side
You will die like fuckin suicide
Save or kill because life unreal
Ask yourselflife of death
I can't stop my nightmare just can't awake
Evil thoughts has come and creep like snake
I would lost my hope and start to pray
Oh my God Help meAll what I say
In the last rays of the setting sun
Retrace your life because the death no fun
It you realy wanna kill youself
Change your mind and you'll prevent your death
Stop this bullshit cause your life undone
I can help to become your death to fun
Immortal soul doesnt must to fly in the sky
Call my name if you gonna die
So you realy wanna be a dead
Get noose on your neck or bullet on your head
Wellcome in Heaven or see you in hell
Some one will tell me that you dyin as well
So you realy wanna be a dead
Pull the trigger and bullet will break your head
Your life is over your flesh will decay
But I don'tblame you just walk this way
Sell me your soul before you will die
I would be mercy and help you to die
Nightmare is over and I'm stayin alive
But I'm hearing words that ring in my mind
Latest night I see the light
That shining from the sky
It's the sign I can't deny
Tomorrow I must die
Deadly omen mortal message
I can't more resist
Take my life but save my soul
It's knock of iron fist
Black StarShine a light on me
Black StarPlease don't set me free
Black StarI can't wait anymore
Black StarIt was never before
Satan's riders came from nowhere
Command my soul in hell
Evil hordes fly like dragons
I don't want stop dwell
Black Star shinin' people people dyin'
It's the end of time
I're got decision in my mission
When I'm first in line
I prowl among all the people but I am so lonely
I'm so hateful that the fire rises within me
I know that it's gonna bring me power

Who am I to question
Every day to understand
This precious beginning
Now fading passing
This is the feel of sadness
Where will solace find me
Where will peace begin
Where will peace begin
I have the call to be true
Find a way for you
The peace be inside
Follow safely home
In my God in His smile
Nothing is impossible
Every day brings an awesome hope
Grace will lead the way
And joy will follow
My heart leaps at the sound of Your voice
Calling my name
And You are so perfect
In every way
A testimony of creation
Beautiful is Your Name
I can't wait to see Him when I wake
Fresh and new
Simple and true
Formed by mercy
Formed by grace
Earth and sky
In Your eyes
Blessed
Pure
You're more than I deserve
You're my blessing
You're my wisdom
You're my freedom
You're my mission
Fusion of blood and water
Industrial changes pulse
The black in eyes
The pins in veins
Parody of love
Comedy in the lost century
at a tail of the meaningless comet
Cold eyes of icons
as dreadful as all the darkest demons
Shackles of grief
Chains of wouldbe freedom
Game of masculine
Game of lust
Unrest emptiness
Glowing flower the Moon and the stellar fields
though with no respect to that magic harmony
Pompous entry in future
Suppression abstraction
Cold fingers of tomorrow
Stiff emotions
Refusal of the deeper sights
into our souls
Needles tongue
Escape entrance
Message to the worldlost
Too receptive hearts extorted
The walls of horror built around
and the cold eyes of icons
whose sights are as dreadful
as all the demons from the depths of this age
The sign of the cross
Satisfaction of crucifixion 
a nightmare upon the shoulders of mankind
choking a little spark of Spirit
in the name of the highest Truth
A slight suggestion of laughter
signifying your condemnation
Sacrifice of love to worship
the Unseen the Unknown one
are growing and blooming along with fear
It's not just a sleep a moment before awakening
but death with a malicious grin
a whiteness never before seen
The fear has blinded their lives
the Sin has become a part of their breaths
The rise of misery has begun
when the suffocation of souls has been done
That was the age of angels
The age of purity
Mere satisfaction of the natural needs
and a common help to feel the mutual solidarity
Development of tribal solidarity
in the name of surviving in a cruel climate
and fights with the killing raiders
The first swallows of the pious social values
the souls and minds slowly start to trouble
in the haughty manners and lies
A profit of the chosen ones
a profit from blood of the innocent souls
The beginning of a decline
Just the questions
and they have let the flames lick their backs
or maybe it was the other way
the sowing has been done
Secrecy of a life
What a chance to survive deep inside the globe
and the shape is its game
Atlantida Where
Role of man is to destroy to rape his own mother
and to laugh at the majesty of time
Role of man is to gnaw to change and to reshape
He forgot to caress the stars
because he has to extinguish them
and to put them below his head at night
A huge wall of sound inside the ears
and a great pressure in the eyes 
Chronos and his laughter
Try to kill a dragon with a needle
just like try to stop the Time
To adapt to the once created Earth
to attack a limit of impossibility
and to master Eternity
Though a mass can not swallow up itself
and a sea can never get dry
never hearing Chronos' laughter anymore
Just like then
but alone now
my body
pocked with cratersdrained belonging to nobody
Over on the horizon where I
so happy then
in the wasteland
Thrusting through the surface of the earth
like the stumps of your trees
breathingand yetnothing could be heard
pervaded by a cancerous smell
just like back then
timelessand mute
My senses were numb as I yielded
to the pain
slowly
Suddenly the fog began to rise from the valley
blue and tender
She rested on my brow
and sleep engulfs me after all those years
Under the sign of Christ we met
At the entrance of God's house
My eyes clasped hers and she just gave in
Desire in my mind
I crave her body to posses
I crave her soul
See me now with lustful thoughts
Redemption come to me
She is leading me into temptation
Innocent sinner victim of lust
Is this angel's or demon's work
Guiding me towards sin
What has she done to me 
always feared God
I'd swear I saw her in black magic
Was it real or illusion
No follower of Christ can be obsessed
with a dirty bitch like that
Wicked girl behold stay away from me
Innocent sinner victim of lust
Ministers are willing to learn
about women that haunt honest men
At night she comes won't leave me alone 
she is wicked and must burn
I knew while her tears fell to fire
That this was the wish of God
Flames of hell will clean her soul
and bring her peace again
Only the devil laughed in scorn of honor
In his envy he left
no work of God untouched
Then you cry out with a clear voice
This way lifting humanity
from this wicked fall
Since his wicked fall all the unhappy ones
blushed before their offspring
ashamed of their exile
Then you cry out with a clear voice
This way lifting humanity
from this wicked falleverywhere
Sed diabolus istud irrisist in invidia sua
intactum dionsit qua nullum opus Dei
Don't believe in all the things you've seen
Gray sky is full of crimson crosses
falling everywhere everywhere
The stone of wisdom
gives me a clear mind
The pain of sin will be cured and end
Temple with no walls
Stone altar of sacrifice
I call the powers
From the Dragon's breath
The Earth forces are rising
Let's fall in trance
In pleasure we'll face the death
Rebirth of Fire
Pagan Rites
Let's forget good and evil
Now starts the reign
Of pleasures of the flesh
Ancient rituals of spring
No church ever killed
Our feast of blood
Shall cross the boundaries of will
Give yourself to the Gods
of days long past
They whisper in darkness
On the night of Beltaine
Give in to the pulsing flames of lust
As voices chant with devotion
All around all around
I loose myself
The Goddess welcomes the Horned One
Priest and priestess unite
Tonight Light the flame of Tara
I will bathe in the blood of sacrifice
Feel the pounding inside
Tonight Swallowed by the tides
Across the river lies the land of the dead
A royal burial place opened by mortals
As we neared the end of the world
I could hear the gods call
Amenofis' daughter
Fate was sealed
make my embalmed body be reborn
make my blind dead eyes shine
Fate was sealed
You will never leave again the cold
So Titanic is your tomb
Daughter of Amenofis
wake up and destroy
all who dares to disturb
your eternal sleep
And the gods are shouting
it was written on your tomb
long ago that you must destroy
There will be no heaven or no hell to them
all who dares to disturb the silence
Spit on their jewels joy and earthly power
Tumble them in a flood of ice
Laugh at their faces drowning in the sea
Your sacred tomb no human hand can touch
Fate was sealed
The curse of the princess you will know
Power outlives her life
Fate was sealed
You will never leave again the cold
So Titanic is your tomb
Now I`m going to play
with the strings of your pain
So don`t hide your tears from me
High pitch screams give me delight
Bring shine of lust into my eyes
I will tear your soul apart
while I cut out your flesh
Please stop begging for mercy
Knives draw down a pentagram
I`ll make you burn in my flames
Black candles call out for more blood
I know that you can resist more
Look at me with your eyes in my hand
Pain Is all I ever wanted
Blood lust Is all I ever need
Pain I am the torturer
Knowing good and evil
But just don't give a damn
Cause I do just what I please
Your bloody skin makes me laugh
please stop your pitiful screams
Suffering purifies your soul
I know that you can resist more
Don't wait for divine justice to come
Master of life and death
Forever the doors of your black magic will open
Shining stars beneath your cape
And your sacred presence hits the heavens
Babylon glowing city of power
You`re the high priestess of Hell
Nothing can conquer you
Not even the sands of time
Enslaved to your light
Brother of the Dark
Page of power
Evil`s child
Enslaved by your light
Brother of the Dark
Mistress of indulgence
Your reign hails Satan our lord
Black goat of the infinite woods
You gave birth to a thousand souls
Mist covering your might
That free our pagan fears forever
In your domain shines ancient light
Let me drink your blood
Hear Marduk's whisper in your ear
Hear my prayer Shubbniggurath
Let me drink your blood
Hear Marduk's whisper in your ear
City of power you are the one
Theseus wore arms worthy of a god
To kill the son of the queen and the beast
In oblivion locked up by Minos
A human body ruled by a white bull head
Seven youths and seven maidens gone away
Sail the ship to sacrifice
Seven youths and seven maidens dressed in gray
Won't escape from the labyrinth
His spirit gets lost inside the labyrinth
Behind every corner awaits another hell
His heart is brave but young
An easy prey to confusion
Seven youths and seven maidens gone away
Sail the ship to sacrifice
Seven youths and seven maidens all in pain
Won't escape from the labyrinth
Two sisters wait for you Theseus
Choose Ariadne she mirrors your soul
Don't fall for Phaedra's acid charms
Don't fight Minotaur with no sword
Force killed by force not by fate
Fallen hero hoist a black sail
Your name heavens won't glorify
Only mortals will praise your deeds
Seven youths and seven maidens gone away
Sail the ship to sacrifice
Seven youths and seven maidens dressed in pain
I'm punished into the mud
You think noone could be right
Except you and your God
Who are you to give punishments
And tell who is right
Who are you to preach
Profligacy of life
I would accept your religion
If you could hold it yourself
Don't try to offer your visions
Because I have my owns
I suppose it's hard to be religious
When life can offer more
Don't despise those who live in sin
'Cause they only enjoy life
According to your confined outlook
I'm punished into the mud
You think noone could be right
Except you and your God
Who are you to give punishments
And tell who is right
Who are you to preach
Profligacy of life
This cult is older than time itself
Connect your mind to our chorus of souls
Experience the act of the putrid flesh
Search your place in this carnal abuse
Dig the soul and desecrate the grave
The time of the gratification is finally reached
I eat your eyes and I kiss your eye sockets
I splatter with your ravaged body
Nothing here on this fuckin' earth
Makes me feel so good
Oh my darling let me come
Deep inside of you
Hear my roar when I eat your ears
Feel my lust when I act to your corpse
Putrid intercourse makes my satisfaction
Search your place in this carnal abuse
Dig the soul and desecrate the grave
The time of the gratification is finally reached
Dismembered corpses lie in the yard
Taste of putrid is in your mouth
The evil world is so far away
Lusts are satisfied and
Graves are desecrated
The master raises his wand
And calls his faithful subordinates
He utters the unholy incantation
And starts this morbid ceremony
They pray for the vital power from unknown
So deceased corpses would live again
The wind of immortality
Blows the spirit into their souls
Mould under the tombstones
Ripples from movements of bones
Corpses rise from the graves
The invocation has come true
Cemetery has born to live
Legion of death performs their duty
The chosen are allowed to live
The others judgement will be death
Judgement will be death
Pray and beseech from your holy bible
Perform the ceremonies from birth to death
You have your own rights
Which deny the blasphemy
But what do I have
Atheist who doesn't believe
Knock on the doors and violate domestic peace
Sell the salvation and I spit against your faces
It's against my views and injures my soul
Your faith is weak and only a deception
The holy bible proves against itself
Your faith is your opinion about religion
But real believer believes always himself
Your forefathers preached
That evilness is Satan
Knock on the doors and violate domestic peace
Sell the salvation and I spit against your faces
It's against my views and injures my soul
Your faith is weak and only a deception
The holy bible proves against itself
Your faith is your opinion about religion
But real believer believes always himself
Pray and beseech from your holy bible
Perform the ceremonies from birth to death
Over and over again they tell when it's time
To leave this world where we live
The prophecy they predict cannot be true
If the year 1914 is the turning point
Why do we still live
Immortal life destroys your vision
Paradise world is not for you
Wars don't end when you believe in God
Humanity won't be saved
Burn the bible
Desert God and prophecies
Ignore the Jehovahs
And the life goes on the way it does
Shadows from beyond of the end
Surround those hypocrisy believers
Mist of the rising life
Folds believers into morbid death
Over and over again they tell when it's time
To leave this world where we live
The prophecy they predict cannot be true
If the year 1914 is the turning point
Why do we still live
Behind the black forest
Centre of the rotten field
There's a forgotten evil grave
Concealing enormous evilness
The bones have changed to dust
A coffin there never was
The tombstone is knocked down
God made this all properly
Six feet under lies the corpse
Flesh was simmered only skeleton was left
But did they see the dissoluteness
That within they religion was
All we imagine that evil is dust
Like the corpse in this unconsecrated grave
But Armageddon approaches all the time
And when the time will reach
It's turn to think to what to believe
Humanness is your weakness
Temptations are your enemies
Lies are your daily vices
And disbelief will be your end
Disagreeable impurity
Disproves existential adherence
Malevolence and desolation
Condemn the funeral souls
As retaliation of heathenism
Is immolation of humanity
Christian resurrection
Is only deception
Incessant morbid suffering
Dismembers humanity to despair
Believe in posthumous life or not
He gives me eternal malediction
But the natural forces make me see
That life will be preserved
My disloyalty has been condemned
To neverending damnation
But I have crossed the line of death
And seen the end of the devout souls
Morbid suffering buries your hope
It's no use to pray 'cause the paradise is lost
Believe in posthumous life or not
He gives me eternal malediction
But the natural forces make me see
That life will be preserved
My disloyalty has been condemned
To neverending damnation
But I have crossed the line of death
And seen the end of the devout souls
Infernal end disastrous lies
Your maggot has burnt in the flames of truth
And your soul wander in the eternal darkness
Pray and beseech help from your godly master
But there is noone to hear your screams
Infernal flames are licking your flesh
Lamentations accompany you to death
Morbid suffering buries your hope
It's no use to pray 'cause paradise is lost
Make a bow and reverence
Give praise to lord never forget his sacredness
Gather together harp the hymn
Make the confession and pray salvation
Satan in his temple
Buries your paradise
He leads your paths
To endless eternity
Godless is truth
You will it see
The death is definitive
It peels your flesh
Crumbles you to dust
Darkling beetles eat you at last
Your bigot is a disease
Like immortality
The only truth you will see
Is the moment that you live
Life has just begun
It never disappears
If the humanity dies now
Comes another way of life
Satan in his temple
Buries your paradise
Satan in his temple
Buries
In the beginning of the chronology
There were centuries lasting persecutions
The reason of fear was that Christians are
Messengers of Satan
In the middle ages the rescuers
Were burned at the stake
Putrid carcasses are only memories
That are left from their bravery
The autodafe death was their
Unwritten destiny
Cadaverous smell inside the coffin
Is their eternal companion
Their lord called God gave directions
Concept and fill the earth
It guarantees the good necessities
For invasion of Satan
Who
Is right me or God
Who
Can I anymore trust
In the middle ages the rescuers
Were burned at the stake
Putrid carcasses are only memories
That are left from their bravery
The autodafe death was their
Unwritten destiny
Cadaverous smell inside the coffin
Is their eternal companion
In the beginning of the chronology
There were centuries lasting persecutions
The reason of fear was that Christians are
Messengers of Satan
So cold so gloomy northern land
In the depth of virgin forest
He is asleep with disgrace
He summons me by hatred heart
I ponder on the sea of chaos
And decide in solitude
My journey will be so hard
The wintermoon's looking after me
The sky covered with weird clouds
The earth splits and swallows all lives
Before the final war every evil thing is ready
I left my land as master told I have no regret
Awaiting fate prepared altar loose my mind
The goal is nigh my steps are light I look back
Their bodies were buried in snow I pause
I find the way to the unseen gate
Go through the ice floe of nordland
In the sign of evil worship
I must open the gate of doom
Summon the troop of darkness in hell
Return of master commands us
Release from eternal freeze
Beyond the gates of unknown infernal gods
Helpless god don't know what to do for them
In the gardens of Eden angels rest on peace
Neglect watch and be sward with lust
No one become aware the other race revenge
Too late to repent it all went wrong
After days torment silence has come
New order was formed by them
Engrave in your mind and know taste of defeat
Curse your weakness and your deadly fate
And perfume of white rose shroud you
Phrase of lure wavw you slowly
You suffer from delusion and reality
Spiritual world is covered by chaos
In deluge of lust deep meditation
Shivery ensamble resound through the cathedral
Aeonian devotion and eternal oath
Do you feel it meanless bindings
I never blame you and pursuit you by disciples
May be fearful painful and lifeless oh my master
Dark oceans you cry writhing in the misery
Bleeding in the despair roar with your soul
You fell away from me my love
when I gave you the keys to my heart
You knew that I had intentions
and you knew it right from the start
Give me one more day
I'll give ya reason to stay
I wanna make you see but you don't listen to me
I'm trying to find a way
Standing on the outside
Looking in
I gave what you said you needed
Then you called me and asked for more
I'm sinkin down so deep but I just can't reach
Tell me what I'm fighting for
I'm feeling upside down
Headed for the ground
If you could only see it should be you and me
flying at the speed of sound
Standing on the outside
Looking in
Standing on the outside
Looking in
I've had enough
Livin' on the outside
It's harder every day
I feel I'm fallin'
Into the emptiness
I'm tired of livin' in pain
I stand in this lonely place
I try to survive
Give me a reason
To say I love you
Give me a reason
To show I care
Give me a reason
To keep on lovin' you
Give me a reason
Wasted days and nights
Fallen from your lips
Bleedin' through my every vein
You know it's hard enough
Tryin' to survive
You seem to think it's a game
A poison arrow
Straight through my heart
You know your aim was so true
I feel I'm fallin'
Into the emptiness
There's nothing more I can do
I stand in this lonely place
You know it's hard to survive
Give me a reason
To say I love you
Give me a reason
To show I care
Give me a reason
To keep on lovin' you
Give me a reason
I can't see your face anymore
through our broken past
I can't feel your pain anymore
I am free at last
this love is lost like a distant sun
in an endless sea
I tried to spread my wings and fly
nothing's left of me
I can't feel this love anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this pain anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel your touch anymore
though you're next to me
can't taste the tears anymore
fit of misery
our day is lost like a setting sun
that's all right by me
I gave my soul and you won't give it back
what do you want from me
I can't feel this love anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this pain anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I just can't believe
that I'm feeling this way
I finally see
this love just can't be saved
I can't feel this love anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this pain anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this love anymore
you turned a heart to stone
I can't feel this pain anymore
you turned a heart to stone
you turn you turn
the heart to stone the heart to stone
you turn you turn
the heart to stone
you turn a heart
you turn the heart to stone
You never saw me comin'
With your naive eyes
You're the right kind of spirit
With the right kind of time
Now you don't pay attention
We get off with a bang
Your reckless obsession
Washed away all your shine
I'm you disease
You embrace my infection
When I cross your lips
You pretend not to notice
When I tighten my grip
I'm your brandnew monkey
On your back if you please
Gonna show you no mercy
When I feed your disease
I'm your disease
I could never ignore you
Any time that we meet
No sign of it slowin'
When you're dead on your feet
I'm your brandnew monkey
On your back if you please
Gonna show you no mercy
When I feed your disease
I'm your disease
Thinkin' 'bout the days spent with you
All The Things that we used to do
Memories of simple things revolve around you
Visions in my mind keep coming through
It Wasn't you and i've known for awhile
How I Miss Your Smile
Funny how this all came to be
Miscommunication it seems
Looking back I realize the truth
I wish that i had listened to you
It' the simple things that change in our lives
Maybe someday I'll get it right
How I miss your smile
This foolish heart is broken there's no cure
And this lonliness is all that I have
We can't take it back the words that we said
Without regrets
Baby I admit that I lied
No Excuse for makin' you cry
I keep starin' at your picture every day
Please forgive me is all I have to say
How I miss your smile
Sometimes long roads
We must travel on
It's not easy
When we walk alone
Always searchin'
To see the sun
Then your bright eyes
Bring me back home
Sometimes it's hard to see the sky
Now I know the reason why
You are my oasis
My calm within the storm
You are my oasis
Always leading me back home
When I miss you
Into the day
One more reason
To keep the faith
Give me patience
Waiting for you
Till that moment
I'll be there for you
You are my oasis
My calm within the storm
You are my oasis
Always leading me back home
Who are they to say they understand
The way that I've had to live
Of all the words we've spoken
Such a tragedy to everyone and so much more
I need to know
Are we livin' in a picture show
I feel that I'm comin' to the point of no return
The pyre that will show us the way
The point of no return
The vision that releases all our pain
Cast down your promises
The revolutions that I should believe
As you touch the tender face of innocence
Not mutually agreed
Come from the other side
Written down only yesterday
I need to know
Are we livin' in a picture show
I feel that I'm comin' to the point of no return
The pyre that will show us the way
The point of no return
The vision that releases all our pain
Save me give back my soul
Hopeless world guess that I'll never know
So long into the abyss
I give myself into the point
The point of no return
The pyre that will show us the way
The point of no return
The vision that releases all our pain
There was a time when our hearts were one
Almost lost you somewhere in the storm
Wings of passion cold and hard to bear
I remember you were standin' there
As we look to the sky
Watching love pass us by
One more time we try to catch a ride
In our hearts there is a dream
Sometimes lost so it seems
Don't let love pass us by this time
I remember the tears of joy we shared
In the darkness when I held you oh so near
Like a dream I have lost you with the dawn
In the fields standing there alone
Searching for home
As we look to the sky
Watching love pass us by
One more time we try to catch a ride
In our hearts there is a dream
Sometimes lost so it seems
Don't let love pass us by this time
Searching for love
Sometimes so hard to see
Searching for love
Sometimes lost in our dreams
As we look to the sky
Watching love pass us by
One more time we try to catch a ride
In our hearts there is a dream
Sometimes lost so it seems
Don't let love pass us by this time
Say a prayer for the day that you first began
all the lies broken truth they don't understand
mesmerized by the world if they only knew
what will you say
when the angels come for you
what will you say
on judgement day
don't want to live without you
you are my world you are my life
don't wanna be without you
on judegment day
touch your heart take it out so they all can see
now exposed to the fate of your misery
I'll sedate all the fears that you say are true
now exposed to the ones that don't care for you
what will you say
when the angels come for you
what will you say
on judgement day
don't want to live without you
you are my world you are my life
don't wanna be without you
on judgement day
what will you say
when the angels come for you
what will you say
on judgement day
don't want to live without you
you are my world you are my life
don't wanna be without you
on judgement day
don't want to live without you
you are my world you are my life
don't wanna be without you
on judgement day
I've been wasting away
Waiting for you you
All the things that you say but never do you
Gotta stay away from the light
Gotta save what's left of my life
Even if it means without you
I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me
I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me
Still it's hard to let go after the show
Gotta save what's left of my life
Gotta save what's left of my life
I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me
I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me
I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me
I can't live anymore inside of this empty dream
I can't live anymore without you beside me
Gotta stay away from the light
Gotta save what's left of my life
Even if it means without you
Even if it means without you
It means when I'm without you
How did I get to this place
My indecision put me in this hole
Deep down walking with the dead
No resurrection it's too late
Release me give me wings again
Release me let me live again
Release me let me fly again
Releases me so I can rise again
I can rise again
Release me
Shadows wrapped around my soul
Taken all my feelings
Now they're left out in the cold
So high that mountain I must climb
I hope I make it while there's time
Release me give me wings again
Release me let me live again
Release me let me fly again
Releases me so I can rise again
I can rise again
Release me
There's no more wishin' wells or fairy tales
Those days are over now
And in the dark where there's no light
It's hard to fight what you can't see
Release me give me wings again
Release me let me live again
Release me let me fly again
Releases me so I can rise again
I can rise again
Release me
How did I get to this place
My insurrection put me in this hole
Deep down walking with the dead
No resurrection it's too late
Release me give me wings again
Release me let me live again
Release me let me fly again
Releases me so I can rise again
I can rise again
Release me
On and on we go again
There seems no point of view
Over under upside down
I don't know what to do
There used to be passion
Don't know when it slipped away
I look around at everyone
It happens every day
I need to get off this spinnin' merrygoround
I'm upside down
No sense in talkin' till the morning comes
I need to feel it once again
This fire is dyin'
I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
This fire is dyin'
I can't feel the passion that we had before
Anymore
Sitting in a place I said I'd never go with you
I need to know what you're lookin' fore
No sense in talkin' till the morning comes
I need to feel it once again
This fire is dyin'
I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
This fire is dyin'
I can't feel the passion that we had before
Anymore
I need the passion to live my life
Live my dreams the way I like
Give no reasons for what I have
I tried to love you
The best I can
This fire is dyin'
I can't feel it burnin' inside anymore
This fire is dyin'
I can't feel the passion that we had before
AnymoreBereft promises made unto me 
I always remember watching them fade 
Upon winds of blackened torment 
The promises' I couldn't see 
For they are just words 
And your words are empty 
LiesLies 
Mada hoathahe Saitan 
Lies are all humanity knows 
For if they spoke truth it would show 
Confusion and lies engulf me 
The bastard humans disgust me 
I scream alone in the mountains venting my hate 
Calling forth emptiness to surround me 
So that I may see clearly with my mind 
The words they use to try to blind me 
I can see 
No one keeps their promises 
No one ever cares 
And neither do I anymore 
Humanities demise is what I lust for 
Disgust for the standards set by you 
Disgust for your aims of mass control 
Freedom is your silencing mechanism 
That while you exist they will never be free 
Your lies of freedom I spit upon 
From birth you have calculated our control 
Born as a number on your little machines 
A number to check upon to keep under control 
Now to the blind I'll help you see 
You are one mind they are many 
Who lived centuries ago leading the fools 
Fuck your morals I have my own mind 
To decide what is best for me 
You know nothing of psychology only of fantasy 
And love of order in your tidy empty lives 
From lies you built the order of society 
From an early age so that they cannot retrieve 
Follow blindly but you'll never blind me 
I have only hatred for those in authority 
And the blind fools who follow 
So weak in spirit never questioning 
I have only hate for this fucking society 
So weak 
I have only hate for this fucking society 
I cry and my eyes spill blood onto the floor 
Acheron flows in silence 
And the noise intensifies my pain 
No will to speak 
Not even enough hope left to weep Anymore 
I travel on through the noise 
Searching for relief 
Distorting my mind 
When clear I laugh only through scorn 
For I have seen of the blackest 
And each sight hath taken from me 
Such misery 
Such sorrow 
Such desolation 
Close to death so many times 
When my hope's been shattered 
When my anger's been unbound 
And my torn soul has cried out for death 
Killing myself through constant abuse 
But I have always awoken 
My scars still bleeding 
And the noise it still carries on 
I look back at nothing 
Questioning my singulation for pain 
The torment the tears that flowed 
Living my death every day 
The foolish dreams of my once young mind 
Now void of hope 
Aged so quickly before it's time 
And no one could see or hear me 
Confusion was my only friend 
In the dark I grew 
I searched and found 
In the dark so long that now I may see 
But the pain still breathes inside of me 
Pain Pain Inside of me 
Rage intensifies my desire for revenge 
Hatred flowing in my blood 
For those who interfere with my life 
They caused me sorrow 
But pain will be returned 
My mind turns to execution 
My sadism fed by their obliteration 
Now to nonexistence 
The thorn in my side caused me pain 
My logic eradicates at the root of my problems 
Those who would give me pain 
Would also make themselves a thorn 
My cure is to remove the cause 
Remove the cause 
Windows of shattered dreams 
Laid out before me 
My broken reflection hauntingly stares back 
As once again I pick up the pieces of my mind 
Rebuilding myself again 
And I know what is done 
The smaller pieces lost 
They used to be large 
But now they are gone 
I cannot find my hope my joy or my life 
Just empty splinters embedded in my mind 
My scars start to bleed 
From my wounds of sorrow 
I watch the blood run 
A release of my selfhate 
And still the blood flows 
Scarred all over my body 
With each scar comes a memory of pain 
Awaiting the day when my blood is no more 
Maybe then the pain will be gone 
I await my death with both relief and with fear 
I sense that my shattered mind knows it is near 
Racing' cross the heavens
Straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet
Slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon
Blazing to the land
Now he's here amongst us
The age of fire's at hand
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
Everything he touches
Fries into a crisp
Let him get close to you
So you're in his trip
First you'll smoke and smoulder
Blister up and singe
When ignition hits you
the very soul of your being will cringe
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man
Where is he from
Exciter comes
For everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
He's come to make you snap out
Of the state that you are in
Looks around and make you
See the light again
So much selfindulgence
Results in shattered eyes
Predominant complacency
Leads to beguiling lies
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation bids to ask
When he leaps amidst us
With combustive dance
All shall bear the branding
Of his thermal lance
Cauterizing masses
Melting into one
Only when there's order
Will his job be done
Stand by for Exciter
Salvation is his task
Stand by for Exciter
Here he comes now
Fall to your knees and repent if you please
Who is this man
Where is he from
Exciter comes
For everyone
You'll never see him
But you will taste the fire upon your tongue
Racing past the heavens
Straight into the dawn
Looking like a comet
Slicing through the morn
Scorching the horizon
Blazing to the land
Now he's here amongst us
The age of fire's at hand
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
Stand by for Exciter
Sunrise wrong side of another day
Sky high and six thousand miles away
Don't know how long I've been awake
Wound up in an amazing state
Can't get enough
And you know it's righteous stuff
Goes up like prices at Christmas
Motorhead remember me now Motorhead alright
Brain dead total amnesia
Get some mental anasthesia
I guess I'll see you all on the ice
All good clean fun
Have another stick of gum
Man you look better already
Motorhead remember me now Motorhead alright
Four days five day marathon
We're moving like a parallelogram
If I can't be wrong I must be right
I should be tired
And all I am is wired
Ain't felt this good for an hour
Motorhead remember me now Motorhead alright

You've got something about you
You've got something I need
Daughter of Aphrodite
Hear my words and take heed
I was born on Olympus
To my father a son
I was raised by the demons
Trained to reign as the one
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you
Of your virgin soul
I'm the lord of the wastelands
A modern day man of steel
I gather darkness to please me
And I command you to kneel before the
God of thunder and rock and roll
The spell you're under
Will slowly rob you
Of your virgin soul
Sometimes I think this woman is kinda hot
Sometimes I think this woman is sometimes not
Puts me down fool me around
Why she do it to me
Out for satisfaction
Any piece of action
That ain't the way it should be
She needs lovin'
Knows I'm the man
She's gotta see
Pour some beer
Licks my ear
Brings out the devil in me
Hell ain't a bad place to be
Spends my money
Drinks my booze
Stays out every night
But I got to thinkin' hey just a minute
Somethin' ain't right
All this disillusions and confusion
Make me wanna cry
Oh the shame you playin' your games
Tellin' me those lies
Don't mind her playin' demon
Long as it's with me
If this is hell
Then you could say
It's heavenly
Hell ain't a bad place to be
Late at night
Turns down the light
Closes up on me
Opens my heart
Tears me apart
Brings out the devil in me
Hell ain't no bad place to be
I said hell ain't no bad place to be
Hell ain't no bad place to be
Hell ain't no bad place to be
Sail in gray
Eyes stare at black
Snow in May
Love you feel but not for me you said
Out of love
I feel like dying
No more your touch
No more to life
The sun I've missed
I'm freezing
Lucid soul
You're killing me
Master faster sweet disaster
Hazy dream
Hazy life
Say saw the sun
I say you're lying
I built in the name of your light
I can't escape I dream of you
Horny feelings haunt my mind
And I'm afraid I can't escape
How a dream can turn so black
Or it's again that female god
Or it's again that devil's mark
She's so real full of beauty
Everlasting like hope I hope
Please turn away and leave my tranquil mind
My christian flesh cannot stand a devil's night
Liar you wanna kiss her
Liar you really feel her
Horny feelings haunt my mind
I am afraid I won't escape
How a dream can be my dope
Or it's again that female god
Or it's again my female god
She's surreal full of beauty
Everlasting like hope I love her so
Please turn away and leave my tranquil mind
My moral eyes cannot stand your sinful sight
Please teach me father how should I love
Hold me mother I think I'm lost again
Lies so many lies to compose my life's song
Please sister help me I wanna live
When all love is gone
Please brotha help me a bright star to be
Somebody's running after you
There are times I do the same
But I cannot stand the way you live
I cannot simply follow sweet
How much I adored your inviting eyes
How much I hated to see you cry
Your love I wanted once not now
Feeling strange enough you cannot understand
Solid cold and ice
A snowing world in your eyes
Crystal tears hide your shine
All your love is dying
Love easy comes and easy goes
Tears always haunted me
Come in my life teach me love
Do you remember when we both watched the stars
It's what I'm doing now with my own life
I've missed the days I've missed the nights
I ride the wind I touch the stars I blow away
I wanna taste what fairytales say
My life I feel her vibes she makes me shine
My life fulfils my soul she makes me strong
What I'd ask my fair
Is to sort this world out
So to get rid of you
From this pity my self hold out
What I'd your gald is
To give you wisdom
So to understand
In what life my dreams are sinking
Said you care but you've never meant it
In what dream my life's sinking
Said you see but you've never seen it
Strange aeons
Are what I'm living in
What's bright fancy white
It's what everyone believes in
Strange love
It's what you do feel
I'd rather hate my self
In the name of my love I've got to kill you
Lowve
All of my love has come to its end
My feelings are lying down dead
One million nights for one million nights
it life
One million lies with one million lies
All those dreams that you've made now fall apart
One million days one million days
 me alone
One million suns one million suns
Humans a race so bloody weak
Strange points of view that make me sick
On that cross they wear their faith all is lying
It's a confused world that's slowly dying
How many times I've felt betrayed
So many times I feel insane
I have an eye for them all I grow strong
The traitor's kiss many missed
The beasts nobody dares to kiss
I'm just a child of this earth
That's how I got the traitor's kiss
What I feel what I think it is purely negative
Once you pushed me down to fall
I felt betrayed I felt alone
It's such a pleasure to meet you here again
Since you denied me I turned out mean
I wasn't really I had to be
It's such a pleasure
So many years and a wide lake of tears
Stay away away from me
A giver never again will be
It's such a pleasure
Since you denied me I turned out mean
I felt betrayed and still I feel
It's such a pleasure
And as the time goes by
So many years and a lake full of
Show me what you feel sister
Show me what you need
Show me how much you want me
Your kiss my lethal dose will be
My lethal dose your love will be
You my savior please take me away from here
You
Dear goddess I feel you
I feel you deep in me
My soul reflects your body
My senses bear your skin your skin
My lethal dose your love will be
Love meDeepest sleep milleniums away
A dream i've discovered in my conscience
Foot soldiers recruit my body for war
White sprites become targets for assault
Abducted i'm invalid and unable to breathe
I am gurgling there is peace in my nightmare
Such tranquil ambience in total darkness
Life is left behind I pursue a red light end
A sinful man is kneeling in the garden
Begging for redemption and forgiveness
Civilizations subjected to gruesome disasters
For not accepting the valiant tale of god
A trembling sky and a symbolic sky
Formed the habitat where the innocent disappear
There they said he cried blood
And the son of man was betrayed
The brothers engage in the final aberration
Carrying the pitiful cross unto the sons of sons
Where the father masturbates on their doctrine
And in the crystal ocean they forever perish
Strips of flesh form a path to the cemetery
Old trees look menacing arching above
A flock of mourners will kneel in his honour
The churchyard holds a most suspicious past
Guests were readily overcome with odd symptoms
In a number of days they'd he consumed by fevers
The Nazarene now crawls to Bethanv
To feed his lying mouth and lepers
Delicate paintings hang beside the once saviour
Lately a certain howling can be heard
And hordes ride freely into the vineyards
Conspicuous
Conspicuous imagery adorns the nunery
Secrets of the Key are rooted beneath the garden
When dogs pass above it they foam at the mouth
And blind nuns play with their own feces
The Nazarene now crawls to Bethany
To feed his lying mouth and lepers
Conspicuous
Figures robed in black sworn to secrecy
Blazing candles placed in the sing of Baphomet
Watching fires rise
Now we burn the skies
Bound by the spells from the ancient pagan rite
Gaze upon the ram the exalted Satanas
Now we clean the air with unholy scent
Spitting on the cross honor Astaroth
Watching fires rise
Now we burn the skies
Fear the stench of the cauldron
Satiate the beast
The precious jehovah
Lies dead in spite
Now drink from the chalice
Sip the pleasures of life
Soon we will be enlightened
Bow to the hermaphrodite
Goat of a thousand young
We thrive in the shadows
In darkness we preside
May the cloaked death carry us
Into the flamelicked sky
May the minions rejoice
For our new millenium
Revel rebel indulge
While the blind sink into cold burial
Into Eternity
In lucid dreams I detach
Teardrops of deliverance
Quantum erasing science
 Obscure and esoteric
Beyond the hollow face
Extending timespace
Once concealed ignites to decipher
As I lay in absence
Leap into my dreamstate
 The parallel universe
Away terrestrial home
You're grown into cold
 The very substance of implanted truth
Avatar's view to unfold
In lucid drams I control
Astral projection my interstellar throne
Awakening to my judgement day
I revive to paint the stars my grains of sand
Flying within space and time
Departed for redeeming
As I lay in absence
Leap into my dreamstate
 The parallel universe
I'm set free eternally
By my dreamlike silver cord
I realign
 In the falling dark that grows
The pulse intensifies now realign
Take my hand and breathe me in
I'm the vile shadow within
Passing sands of space and time
Distorted face of the new formation
Worlds apart to entertain
Apparition beyond pain
Drift between dimensions
Traverse all the lights and shades
Escape through the astral door
Aside another downfall
My emptiness will dig a hole in your chest
The subliminal void guiding your quest
Dreams in a slumber you're in my control
Reforming the pathway I'll topple your throne
Deep inside off this mortal coil
Weakened light that casts no allabsorbing shadow
Drift between dimensions and take another form
Shadow people rebirth of morphogenetic code
 New formation
Worlds apart to entertain
Apparition beyond pain
Drift between dimensions
Traverse all the lights and shades
Escape through the astral door
Leap to another lifeform
In immortal streams I see you
Mirrored and lit by this heathen glory
These mortal realms are now overthrown
Desire for my infinite story
Shadow People
Flashing holograms of artificial life
In the darkest corners of the very mind
Away this chemical institution of oblivion
Discarded memories veiled in confusion
Pictures in my head like fiction
Blending through the nightveiled kingdoms
Gruesome revelations
Face twisting and quantum erasing
Time particles accelerating
Pihelated spiral ways to Sirius
This is the ultimate versus terminus
Born of memoryprojecting termination device
Supercharger if the planetary demise
Sweet and genocide dreams I see of a mankind
Like the cleansing rain
Wash away to reign
The storm is breaking to change everything
The storm is invading Erasing Rebreeding
Dust devils and cosmic storms
Spark the endless leaps to unknown
Universe beyond expanding black holes
Like a perfect chaos of macrocosmic scales
Astronomical body's hidden gateways
Blazing like a vortex across the brain
In layers of the cortex peel off the pain
Ant human God physical to spiritual
Control human delete
To be reborn
Depiction of mortality
A wasteland of lost reality
Heart of transiency
Beating to immortality
Sleep in cryonics' instant forever
Injected elements of perfection
Cascade through body
Pulse of regenerating
A remedy
Unreality
Your reality
My reality
Immortality
Let me crawl into your thirsty veins
And give the one last rush to take away the pain
I'm the drowning rain
Of immortal aeons  becoming eternally forever
Are you a God
Physical to spiritual
Delete human control
The vortex of the storms
Undress for the ruthless caress
Burst in the bliss of ignorance
As I vaporize for you to breathe
Let go succumb to my will
For abysmal pit of lives bleeding to feel alive
Of immortal aeons
Bypassers in disguise playing God to be alive
For lives
The great unwashed arises
Acid Christ tripping disciples
The serpent of light
In flesh I'm bound
Bloodline never found
Now see what I see
My eternal life
I'm your reptilian overlord
The fallen bastard son of God
Your liquid demons and angels
 Machinespawned human race
Now behold my legacy
Hybrid bloodline theory
And the great unwashed arises
Forever tripping disciples
Land of lost mysterious and plain
The place so arcane and so strained
Risen from the ashes of grace
Slaves to the mortal crown
The lords of the cold and decadent ground
Decomposed generations All consuming
Armageddon sun is colder
The dead weight of my soul
A burden of my frozen heart
The pulse of demise a few heartbeats away
Echoing flatline silence that will stay
Ending miles of radiant smiles
Detach your holographic self
Fragmented dreams the world shall befall
Shallow graves in blistering surface
Permafrost era overdrive
All erasing phenomenon
Hollow faces with a blistering surface
Permafrost era overdrive
A clockwork apocalypse
The pulse of demise
Time is ticking away day after day
Hollow faces with a blistering surface
Permafrost era overdrive
Mercury blood burning into the sulphur sky
Collapsed illusory order
Consumable time gets older
 Parasites in bias paradise
We're the army of ignorance
Marching towards the dying paradise
Hordes of the metamorphic kill filling the sky
Reflecting the total
Termination in a blinding blink of an eye
Intoxicated bliss
Decayed one last kiss
The countdown starts from here
Shape shifting face of deformed quality
Blazed by sun winds
Smokescreen beyond polluted unreality
Under oath for tainted declaration
Wandering soul alone so astray
Sworn to ungraceful definition
Fulfilling demise
I've forseen the end of the prayers' epic fail
By the fallen angel of retributions trail
Come and taste the flavours of the failed breed
Living to die for satisfaction guaranteed
Eye of the void  the show of your tainted dreams
 Children of abysmal machinists of the end
Shadows fading among the planetary collision
The fathomless descent
Deadweight world  nexus for perdition
Breeding from within  the void resurrecting
So depraved
Peel the rotting fruit of your extinction
A Godpuppet of abject transgression
Salvation through the joyride of devastation
So I lay my darkness on you
New residence for my poisonous bloom
Trapped
From the falling sky
Raining through quicksands of time
Blood covers the shattered ground
Womb of glass nurturing the faceless
Deadweight and all so real
Stuck in this feargalloped despair
Room of my thoughts collapsing
Lights are shutting as walls keep falling
Evolution chained inside and fading
In the house of glass I'm shattering
Isolated and restrained of breathing
Sands slipping through my hands
As we're trapped in an hourglass
Dead eyes stare but see no future
Face to glass with stagnated nature
Gained the absence of evolution
Timeless days and lingering motion
I keep on running for nothing
Time's wearing thin
I keep on sinking
Cannot see my seethrough heart within
Swallowed by the falling skies
Numbered and next in line Buried alive
Mouthful of quicksand of time
Locked in a glass coffin suffocating
I Can't Breathe
You keep on running running for nothing
And the time is wearing thin
You keep on sinking cannot breathe
 Your seethrough heart within
Trapped In Hourglass
Phantasm of deserted realms
Approaching glowing red
Felt the burning in my soul
Captured all All I've ever known
Lost in xenomorphic temples
Euphoria of nonexistence
Six hundred lightyears away
An explosion driven shockwave
Nebulous speed of lightyears
Cosmic collision of imminent mind override
Sight of my burning eyes
Xenomorphic
This celestial sphere breaking
Consciousness in the taking
Invading miraculous sway
Dark particles strain
Life craving binaural threat
Encroaching pulse of death
Transfixed like a deadweight bait
Waiting phantom limbs paralysed
Felt the burning in my soul
Captured all All I've ever known
Ageing and dying eyes closed Ageing dying
So many questions unsolved
Forever night unfolds
 I don't belong
Mesmerized ignorance
Settling for nonexistent will
Asepticism schism drilling in
Xenomorphic all consuming holographic thoughts
Departure of our will Demeaning
Rotting bloom evolutionary infertility
Spilling dead weight of the world that bleeds
Parasites swarm eating allabsorbing
Scavenging humanity will fall
Breathe the fall and feed on dark matter
Imprisonment in a body of pain  your last hive
 Obscure corners of mind that buries you alive
Cataclysm child walking in shadows
Lethal quantum running through the veins
Doctrine of descendants in the wake
Maggots of mayhem breeding serpentine silence
Sinister dimensional turbulence
Opened the bloodstained box
The great cold paradox
Look at the neglected world
A sight to behold for endless timespace
Cataclysm child wears a burden inside
A temple of needs Paradoxical work of artificial
The perfection made of scars
Exhale the dead weight in you
Raise the glass for abomination
Inhale the vague scavengers' nation
Bleeding feeding this tormenting sight
Sealing covenant death for eternal life
Feel the frost absorbing your warmth
This carnal prison burns so cold
Heed the will of the breathing paradox
Smothered beatings of the Earth black box
Spilling poisonous wine
Doctrine of failed design
Opened the blood stained box
The great cold paradox
How can I tell them What to do
What if I am crazy too
Should I tell them or should I not
Is this way to go or not
What if they will not understand
But to live like that I can't
I will tell them they'll help me
Other solution I don't see
Voices I hear
What is worse them or my fear
And once again
Voices in my head I hear
They are like pain
They want something they are near
They talk again
Do they have something to tell
Am I insane
Are they from the place called hell
Just look at her did you see
That is weird what might that be
Is she sick or maybe possessed
Or if it is God's plan it's the test
I tell you I know what it means
Punishment for our sins
You know it's not single nightmare
There is evil living in her
Voices inside
In my head night after night
For the reverend we need to call
He's the one will save her soul
He was doing that in the past
Maybe Julia's soul will then rest
It is too much how can we live
He will help her let's believe
Messenger of God holy man
Will he help her No one else can
Voices she hears
How can we fight with our fears
Can you help her please
It's our guilt
Do what shall be done
We know you killed
Dear reverend save her soul
She won't be the devil's doll
It's the only way
We know the price
But what can we do
Just see her eyes
In God's name we should act
She's possessed it's a fact
Does she need to die our girl
Maybe there is a way
She means the whole world to us you know
Just give us one hope's ray
Julia is possessed Listen to me
We should kill her
And let it be
Can't you see them demons of the night
Dark and nasty
They will not hide
Only death will save her soul
I know what to do
So now let's pray
I did it before
Do what I say
Yes maybe she will die
I don't know I won't lie
Candles sacred cross
My weapons are
God is with me yes
He is not far
Holy book and the stole
The demon will pay toll
Does she need to die our girl
Maybe there is a way
She means the whole world to us you know
Just give us one hope's ray
Julia is possessed Listen to me
We should kill her
And let it be
Can't you see them demons of the night
Dark and nasty
They will not hide
Only death will save her soul
Demon is screaming
Evil and loud
I am protected by holy ghost
Demon is growling
I'm not afraid
The battle has begun no way back it's too late
God will judge me
I know what to do
I am his soldier protector of truth
Cross will be my sword
I know that game
Just one look in her eyes
And I know what's his name
Don't judge me you can't
Fight evil with evil
In holy name of God I kill
To hell I won't bend
Fight evil with evil
Don't ask questions it is God's will
For demons I hunt
Many have died
But let God decide if that is right
I don't ask questions
I feel their hate
They do not understand it's my fate
Yes time to begin
What did you say
No turning back now it's too late
Bring me the candles
And lock the doors
I know he will try to escape I feel his force
The devil I see
End justifies the means
She needs to die
Her soul is in my hands
It's because of your sins
She needs to die
Exorcism I will start
With God's will on my side
Evil is here
We don't have much time
With the devil i fight
The end is near
Do you see
Yes the witch's mark
Right here on her arm
Take a look
Symbol of the dark
Which heralds big harm
The devil
Marks his chosen ones
And they feel no fear
The symbol
That was seen not once
Her soul it will tear
The evil is near
The mark of the witch
The mark of the horned one
What are your sins
Tell me what have you done
In my very old books
Seen it before
It's the sign of Sarah
The devil's whore
Did you know
Sarah was a witch
Many years ago
At the stake
They burned the devil's bitch
No regrets oh no
You know that
Witches should be burned
In pain they should die
It's God's will
Now it's our turn
Don't look in her eye
Or we all will die
Please take him away from here
You need to believe me
I've got something to say
There's no evil in me
I'm not the evil one
I'm alone and I'm afraid
I don't know where to hide
They don't want to listen why
There's no one on my side
Too late what have you done
I'm not the evil one
I know it's hard
To trust in me
Please just listen to what I must say
Hand on heart
Yes you will see
He is the liar take him away
They won't listen to your lies
Your soul will be set free
This is a holy sacrifice
God is speaking through me
You are the evil one
Like so many before you
I'll send you back to hell
I know truth is on my side
Demonic tricks I know well
What is going on here
What's that what do I hear
So stupid you are
Proud human race
It went much too far
Way to much grace
It is boring I'm tired
I just wanted to talk
The same story again
For so many years
The same mistakes you do
Thinking you should unlock
I have to tell you that
Future will bring tears
Why don't you understand
I won't let you kill her
The truth is hidden out there
Now you shut up and listen to me
Better understand my words
There's no evil in me
You bring only suffering
Please stop threatening me
You need to believe me
So it shall be done
You will die you will burn
This is my sacred duty
Some way I will find
Exiled you will be
You will die you will burn
You are the fallen I am not
I know what is in your mind
I know I am right
You will be burnt
You won't hide
I'll crush you down
Truth is on my side
I'll send you straight
Back to hell
I'll drive away this
Spiteful wicked spell
You shouldn't have come
I'll drive you out from here
I can promise you that
I will show no fear
Holy water's touch
It's too late you can't run
The ritual I begin
Holy Spirit Father Son
They are on my side
You have no right to tell me what to do
I'm one of many we created you
You pray to us and you call us angels
We created you before the ages
We created the human race it was a mistake
You're evil and greedy and you love to kill
Always here from above
We were watching you
We have seen what you've done
You're cruel and blind
Between stars we were born
And we are many
Better you listen to us
While you still have time
The earth does not belong to you oh no
You are guests our 'creation'  to say so
the plan was good and we gave you free will
But it all went wrong and you love to kill
We created the human race it was a mistake
You are evil and greedy and you love to kill
Stupid you are
And went to far
We know how human race will die
Big flaming sword of doom will split the sky
Will be too late
To change your fate
And there will be nowhere to run
In July of Two Thousand SixtyOne
In the sky you will see
Prophet of the end
You will know it's the time
For the human race to bend
I will tell you where we are from
There will be no time left to cry
When prophet of the end will come
Earth will die
But you still have time to change your fate
What will happen depends of you
You need to forget about your hate
You have to
To give you earth
It was a mistake
So wonderful was our aim
From Zeta Reticuli we here came
Now I will leave
Better believe
We're no demons we're creators
Of foolish human race inventors
In the sky you will see
Prophet of the end
You will know it's the time
For the human race to bend
I've gored my chest
Rushing into nothingness
My soul is gone my body's dead
a reptile shedding skin a brand new side of me
This is my revolution my conclusion
Of the world a wicked place
Filled with shallow selfish creatures
Tearing at my flesh
To whom it may concern
I'd love to watch you burn
A parasitic pandemic
The bane of my existence
No karma for the wicked Ignorance is bliss
The lucky ones are left digging through the shit
This is my revolution my conclusion
Of the world a wicked place
Filled with heartless evil creatures
Ripping at my flesh
Lights Camera Action
A superstar with a fatal attraction
Bare flesh with makeup to hide the scars
You look so glamorous begging from your knees
Doing everything it takes for a life of luxury
To lose integrity
Xrated and jaded your purity is penetrated
You've sold your soul
Congratulations you've made it
You love to be on top but you've failed
Welcome to Hollywood
Where all your dreams come true
Abandon everything
This is the price of fame
Gag on this it'll take you to the top
27 murdered in the streets
Peace to violence violence to peace
A public execution becomes reality
Immortalized for the world to see
This is the price of freedom
This is the price she paid
Innocence betrayed
Open your fucking eyes
It's time to realize
This happens every day
Tehran a place of protest
Ancient necropolis
Images ingrained forever
Angel of Iran a nightmare that never ends
We raise our fists in your honor
We the people ice in our veins
Pandemonium all hope is shot
A voice of a generation
Yet she didn't say a word
A face so unforgettable
Until we meet again
Neda angel of Iran
Neda the world won't soon forget
Your face the cause you died for
Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night
Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Playin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time
Some will win some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding somewhere in the night
Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
Out of the ruins
Out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children
The last generation
We are the ones they left behind
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
Living under the fear till nothing else remains
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the thunderdome
Looking for something we can rely on
There's got to be something better out there
Love and compassion love and compassion
Their day is coming their day is coming
All else are castles built in the air air
And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
Living under the fear till nothing else remains
All the children say
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the thunderdome
So will our story shine like a life
We leave only a mark
Will our story shine like a light
Or end in the dark
Give it all or nothing
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome
We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the Thunderdome
WE ARE THE CHILDREN
OH I WONDER IF WERE EVER GONNA CHANGE IT
Nothing else remains
THE LAST GENERATION
HM WE CAN LEAD YOU OUT OF THE RUINS
OUT FROM THE WRECKAGE
OUT FROM THE WRECKAGE
Baby I don't understand
Why we can't just hold on
To each other's hands
This time will be the last
I fear unless I make it all so clear
I need you so
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
And learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up
And let us in
Baby I think tonight
We can take what was wrong
And make it right
I need you so
Baby it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood makes me whole
I need you so
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
And learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up
And let us in
She said Come on baby I got a licence for love
And if it expires pray help from above
In the midnight hour she cried more more more
With a rebel yell she cried more more more
In the midnight hour babe more more more
With a rebel yell more more more
More more more
She don't like slavery she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to be me babe
What set you free I need you hear by me
Because
In the midnight hour she cried more more more
With a rebel yell she cried more more more
In the midnight hour babe more more more
With a rebel yell more more more
He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the seven eleven
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
I walked the world with you babe
A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain babe
A million times for you
I'd sell my soul for you babe
For money to burn with you
I'd give you all and have none babe
Just just justa justa to have you here by me
Because
In the midnight hour she cried more more more
With a rebel yell she cried more more more
In the midnight hour babe more more more
With a rebel yell she cried more more more
More more more
Oh yeah little baby
she want more
More more more more more
Oh yeah little baby
she want more
More more more more
Do you remember a guy that's been
In such an early song
I've heard a rumour from Ground Control
Oh no don't say it's true
They got a message from the Action Man
I'm happy hope you're happy too
I've loved all I've needed love
Sordid details following
The shrieking of nothing is killing
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and
I ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair
And I'd quit but the planet it's glowing
Ashes to ashes fun to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an alltime low
Time and again I tell myself
I'll stay clean tonight
But the little green wheels are following me
Oh no not again
I'm stuck with a valuable friend
I'm happy hope you're happy too
One flash of light but no smoking pistol
I've never done good things
I've never done bad things
I've never done anything out of the blue wohooh
I want an axe to break the ice
I wanna come down right now
Ashes to ashes fun to funky
We know Major Tom's a junkie
Strung out in heaven's high
Hitting an alltime low
My mama said to get things done
You'd better not mess with Major Tom
Fallen on hard times
But it feels good to know
That milk and honeys just around the bend
Running on bad lines
Wed better run as we go
Tear up tear up the overdraft again
Oh dear prime minister
It's all such a mess
Go right ahead and pull the rotten tooth
Oh mr president
you've been put to the test
Come clean for once and hit us with the truth
Looking for sunshine
Oh but it's black and it's cold
Giving us a hard time my friends
Handing us the same line again
Fallen on hard times
And theres nowhere to hide
Turning on the peace sign
And it's back to the wood
Soon there will be raised a holy stink
Somebody wake me
I've been sleeping too long
Oh I dont have to take this lying down
You can keep your promises
Shove'em where they belong
Dont ask me to the party
Won't be around
I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
and I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed the cat's in the cradle
Oh I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away I should've walked away
Is there any just cause for feeling like this
On the surface I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet but then blow it again
I've lost and found it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy no give and all take
Oh I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away I should've walked away
It was a long hot night
She made it easy she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment is gone
I followed my hands not my head
I know I was wrong
You could have a steam train
If you'd just lay down your tracks
You could have an aeroplane flying
If you bring your blue sky back
All you do is call me
I'll be anything you need
You could have a big dipper
Going up and down all around the bends
You could have a bumper car bumping
This amusement never ends
I want to be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
Oh let me be your sledgehammer
This will be my testimony
Show me round your fruitcage
Cause I will be your honey bee
Open up your fruitcage
Where the fruit is as sweet as can be
I want to be your sledgehammer
Why don't you call my name
You'd better call the sledgehammer
Put your mind at rest
I'm going to be the sledgehammer
This can be my testimony
I'm your sledgehammer
Let there be no doubt about it
Sledge sledge sledgehammer
I've kicked the habit
Shed my skin
This is the new stuff
I go dancing in we go dancing in
Oh won't you show for me
And I will show for you
Sshow for me I will show for you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I do mean you
Only you
You've been coming through
Going to build that power
Build build up that power hey
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
Going to feel that power build in you
Come on come on help me do
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you
I've been feeding the rhythm
I've been feeding the rhythm
It's what we're doing doing
All day and night
You got me running going out of my mind
You got me thinking that I'm wasting my time
Don't bring me downno no no no no
Don't bring me down
You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm tellin you it's go to be the end
Dont bring me downno no no no no no no no
Dont bring me down

One of these days youre gonna get it right
Don't bring me downno no no no no

You get me crawling up to you everyday
Don't bring me downno no no no no
Don't bring me down
I can feel it coming in the air tonight Oh Lord
Well if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
It's all been a pack of lies
I can feel it in the air tonight Oh Lord Oh Lord
Well I remember I remember don't worry
The hurt doesn't show but the pain still grows
It's no stranger to you or me
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
And I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
She's running out again
She's running out
She's run run run running out
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
I've been alone with you inside my mind
I sometimes see you pass outside my door
Hello is it me you're looking for
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much I love you 
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow
Hello I've just got to let you know
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying I love you 
Hello is it me you're looking for
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying  I love you
These mist covered mountains
Are a home now for me
But my home is the lowlands
And always will be
Some day you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arm
Through these fields of destruction
Baptism of fire
I've watched all your suffering
As the battles raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms
There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Every man has to die
But it's written in the starlight
And every line on your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms
From Genesis to Revelations
I walk through every gate
Searching for the path to enlightenment
Step by step
Against the odds of humans
Walk through the gate
Accept
Make a choice
Keep walking
Never give in
Embrace it
Light the fire
Never look back
Hold your head high
This is your last chance
I suffer with every page of this life
Every chapter is suffering
A maze of inhumanity lies before my doorstep
A thirst for knowledge
Embracing every aspect of creation
Born to a great existence
Without mercy or compassion
Forced to live in isolation
To nurture the power of the gods
Listen
To the ballad of ordinary flowers
Listen
To the story of the god of nature
There was a silence of many words spoken
By the incarnation of wisdom
In the heat of the night
I call upon old forces
I know nothing of submission
Im the great god of nature
This existence
At the mercy of my own humanity
I conquer the light
And expand
I breathe under water
I drown in the air

Follow me into the fire
Follow me into the fire
Fueling the corporate machine
Everything must stay the same
Collective disbelief
Harvesting horror
While fearing it created it
A nation of frustration
Elected misery
Passively consuming
Headline propaganda
Externalizing pain
Spreaders of hate
Blame upon the blamers
This war is in all of us
Kill
Resurrect
Resuscitate
Declaring the enemy
Throwback history
Our scars of silence
A monument of ignorance
Confessions of fear
The ultimate sacrifice
Carnage or feast
On the edge of sanity
Keep us tight
Keep us small
Make us believe you're 8 ft tall
Sell us high
Buy us low
According to the protocol
Attention is an asset Follow me into the fire
You critique the mainstream Into the fire
You manipulate the mainstream Into the fire
And while you're busy keeping your integrity
Society is catching up
And you become the mainstream
You become the mainstream
You become the mainstream
You
Authority through iconography
Authority through ipornography
The pig must fear
What the pig must fear
The blood on your hands
Is none of your business
You're not the soldier
You're the gun
Follow me kill
Follow me kill
Follow me kill
Follow me killWe are the light
We are the fire
We are the setting sun
So sick so sick of living with no purpose
You built these walls to hold us down
Why don't you come down from your throne
Watch them fall to the ground
We will claim victory
You can't defeat us
You can't defeat us
Brick by brick piece by piece
Brick by brick piece by piece
We will claim victory
We are the light
We are the fire
We are the setting sun
You built these walls to hold us down
Why don't you come down from your throne
Watch them fall to the ground
We will rise
Take the throne
You will fall to your knees
You will fall to your knees
Born in the land of the heartless
Bound by the chains of the soulless
Our years as slaves behind us victorious
Brick by brick piece by piece
We will claim victory
We are the light
We are the fire
We are the setting sun
We will claim victory
You can't defeat us
You can't defeat us
This is not right
Thinking everything's OK when it's not
This has got to end
We fell so many times
How much longer can we fake it
This has got to end
This has got to end
We're rotting in filth
With no one to blame
We're not machines
This is such a shame
Such a shame
We can't fake what we never had
Follow the road and never look back
Search for a better life they said
Will it be alright We wanna know
When will it end When will it end
Constantly on the run what have we become
Will it be alright
We wanna know
When will it end When will it end
I will find hope I will kill pain
I will kill the thought of loneliness
We will find a home we will kill the hate
We will kill the heartless
Will we get it right
Thinking everything's OK when it's not
This has got to end
We fell so many times
How much longer can we fake it
This has got to end
We can't fake what we never had
Follow the road and never look back
Search for a better life they said
Will it be alright We wanna know
When will it end When will it end
Constantly on the run what have we become
Will it be alright We wanna know
When will it end When will it end
I will fight for you if you will fight for me
I will die for you if you will die for me
This blood is true you see
The only thing we have left is our family
We will rise overcome
Now is our time
We will rise and conquer
Everything this world ever stood for
This blood is true you see
We will rise overcome
Now is our time
We will rise and conquer
Everything this world ever stood for
Don't you go and leave me here
All alone in this sick dark world
I've got these demons to fight
They make we weak and I can't do this all alone
I've fallen oh so far
But if you leave me right now
I won't I won't I won't make it out
This isn't all about you
This isn't this isn't all about you
This isn't all about you
Don't you go and leave me here
Don't you don't you go
You blame yourself you get depressed
You pull yourself down till no one's around
But you stay right here you cling to the past
And in a moment time stood still
In one single moment time stands still
You take the edge hold it against your veins
Time stands still
Think about your actions everyone's reactions
There's so many others that love you
If you were gone
Would time stand still
If this were me and you were in my place
Would time stand still for you
I know this world is such a dark dark place
Dark dark place
I know this world is such a dark dark place
Dark dark place
You blame yourself you get depressed
You pull yourself down till no one's around
But you stay right here you cling to the past
You blame yourself you get depressed
You pull yourself down till no one's around
But you stay right here you cling to the past
We need you back
Don't you go
You're tearing us apart when you blame yourself
Don't you go
You stay right here we need you here
Don't you go
You're tearing us apart when you blame yourself
Don't you go
You will stay right here we need you here
We need you
I'm here to put you in your place
I will bury you
I will bury you
Forgive Forget
I laugh at the thought of that
Yeah you better run
If the world could see who you are
Would you run would you run
You've lost your heart you've gone too far
Look what you've become you've become
I saw the aftermath aftermath of your blood bath
Six feet underneath a bloody history
Six feet underneath destroy your legacy
If the world could see who you are
Would you run would you run
You've lost your heart you've gone too far
Look what you've become you've become
I could turn this all around
'Cause I don't want to be like you be like you
But I know this is something I have to do
Make you wish you never saw another setting sun
With your neck under my knee
And my arm raised high
Someone's gonna die
Forgive Forget
I laugh at the thought of that
Yeah you better run
Six feet underneath a bloody history
With these thoughts on my mind I'll never sleep
Devil devil devil
I'll be dead before they find me
You held the thoughts in the back of your spine
Feeding me hope for something I would never find
I'm pathetic pathetic
You're the heartless the heartless
I'm a trainwreck a trainwreck
You're the heartless
When you look into the eyes
Does the rain fall through the deep blue skies
Are you too blind to see you're just a devil
With these thoughts on my mind I'll never sleep
Devil devil devil
I'll be dead before they find me
I'll never sleep with this pain so deep
There is no place to shake this agony
No way to break these chains
It's in my heart you see
There is no way to save my life
When I'm sleeping next to the devil at night
I'm pathetic pathetic
You're the heartless the heartless
I'm a trainwreck a trainwreck
You're the heartless
When you look into your eyes
Does the rain fall through the deep blue skies
Are you too blind to see you're just a devil
With these thoughts on my mind I'll never sleep
Devil I'm sleeping next to the devil at night
Devil I'm sleeping next to the devil at night
Devil I'm sleeping next to the devil at night
Devil I'm sleeping next to the devil at night
Arms upheld unto the Sky
Blindly I Follow
Soon All will be Revealed
Searing Transcendant
Visions of Divine Intent
Worshipful Obediant
I Await the Burning
In Supplication
I turn my eyes toward the Sun
It Burns
I turn my eyes toward the Sun
Its Flames
Oh God it Burns
Refusing to look Away
In Agony
I become Divine
Obeisance I Make
Engulfed in Radiant Fury
Amon  Ra
The Hidden One
Takes my sight that I might See
Blinded I cry Out
In Gratitude
Tears Streaming
I Return unto the Sands
Burnt Charred
I behold no God
I Become Divine
Eaters of Human Flesh
Hath eaten unlawful Flesh
Upon our Brethren
They Have Feasted
Seed of our Father
We must now Avenge
In secret conclave we Gather
To rain Destruction on those Whom
We have Cursed
With vile Black Arts
And Tempestuous Rage
We vent our Wrath
Red Blood stains my Hands
And damns my Soul
You will drink the Black Sperm
Of my Vengeance
The Mighty Voices
Of my Vengeance
Smash the Stillness of the Air
And stand as Monoliths of Wrath
Upon a plain of writhing Serpents
I call upon the messengers of Doom
To slash with Grim Delight
This Victim I have Chosen
Feed upon his Brain Pulp
Rend his Throat
Pierce his Lungs with the stings of Scorpions
Oh Kali
Oh Sekhmet
Oh Dagon
Nanna Father of the Zonei
Eldest of the Wanderers
A Shadow out of Time
The Moon is calling Me
The Breath of the Old Ones
Whispers in my Ear
With inhuman Impatience
They Beckon to Me
I call to the Moon and Sin
I now possess the secrets of the Tides of Blood
I have traveled on the Spheres
And the spheres do not protect Me
I have Walked in the Pit
And the Pit does not protect Me
The Lords of the Wind rush about Me
The Lords of the Earth crawl about my Feet
And are Angered
A Wind has Risen The Dark Waters Stir
The lines of my life have been Obliterated
By my wanderings in the Waste
My fate is no longer Writ in the Stars
For I have broken the Covenant
Have the Gods forsaken Me
I cannot read the Omens
What sacrifice have I failed to Make
I call to the Gods
Do not cast thy servant Down
Wrought What have I Done
Atheos anarchas
No belief in any deity
No lies or false idols
No dogma shall enslave me
My words of truth
The tongue of fire
A cleansing of utter blasphemy
No law of man or god
No chains of servitude
Bind me to the unjust
Purify me in flames
I have no fear of retribution
Before no graven images
Shall I bend in acquiescence
Say not unto me
Thou shall not
The head of Ramses
Lies fallen to the ground
Brokencrumbleddestroyed
Left in ruins
Godless
Whisper silence in my Ear
Uncover the truth of Insignificance
Paint the anguish of the Private Soul
Reveal pathetic Tragedy
As sleep I dream of Death
Seething with Rage
Exquisite Rage
Amplify the Vision
Does it Matter
Does it Matter
Paradise Lost
Dreaming of Extinction
We wander through the Walls of Sacrifice
Sick winds brush against my Skin
Power of Extinction
Growth Intelligence No More
Mud Rot Skeletal Earth
Drown thy spirit of Kings
Society's walls break Down
Humans Pound Down
Dig I must dig Out
Surviving puts all tools in Place
Only peace comes in Death
As I sleep I dream of Death
Only Peace comes in Death

They utterly and completely Annihilate Me
I can hear the Howling of the Jinn
Echoing in the mountains of Kaf
Wretched Fallen ones of Khatti
Raise against the oppressing Sword
Encircled Abandoned Alone
I Smite the vile Hittite Foe
My Father Amon what carest Thee
For the Vile and Ignorant of God
My Father Amon what carest Thee
For these Effeminate ones
At millions of whom I groweth not Pale
Raging like Menthu like Baal in his Hour
Lo the mighty Sekhmet is with Me
I enter in among them even as a hawk striketh
I slay I hew to pieces and cast to the ground
The royal snake upon my brow
Spits forth Fire in the face of mine enemies
And Burneth their Limbs
My Chariot Wheels trample the Fallen
Cut to pieces before my Steeds

Gash their throats with Weapons of Iron

With Locusts and DiseaseYou can't control this
a neverending pain
You never cared too mach
About me man
You cannot stand this
but I'm shaking off my chains
You don't like to see this
New light in my eyes
No veils on my face
No fears in my mind
And now I'm used to lokking you
Fixedly in the eyes
And I swear to myself
You'll never hear me say
I feel so lonely tonight
And I wish that I could die
Too much cold is this place
And I think I won't survive
I feel badly hurt tonight
Cannot really stand this pain
Too many tears are in my eyes
I need love to make them wiped
But I say you are foolish
If you do think that I can be
Such a stupid
And you cannot forget this
'Cause I'm taking my first steps
To a new life
You consumed my emotions
Treading on them as if
Nothing were the matter
I can't tell you how long I've suffered
But it helped me
In getting stronger
Now I swear there's something
You will never hear me say
Swear something you will never hear me
Im trying to forgive myself
For every slip I made
But everything reminds me them
Trying to forget the past
To put the things apart
Why don't you try to realize
I'm dying deep inside again
This time will be the last one
But you don't understand me
Now I'm trying to find my way
And realize I have to try again
Tonight I'm changing
Feeling like never felt before
I am healing myself from every wound
I am getting hidden from shadozs no more
I've tasted the fear
On my knees I've stayed for years
And now I'm learning how to get free
Learning how to be
What you will never be
Now that you see
Who I am it's yours that fear
'Cause now I'm learning how to get free
Leaning how to be
What you will never be
I don't want to forgive you
For all you have done
I don't want to believe you
Your time has come
I don't know if you care but
I won't be there
When you will get my response
With all of my rage yeah
I don't want to be the one you wish
I don't know why you still persist
In your stupid lies and nasty things
Don't know what to do with your apologies
It's time to wake up and open your mind
To a different way in living your life
Maybe you will realize that
I won't be longer the object of your lies
You know I am so tired
No longer I1ll resist
Just listening to your lies
Without really getting sick
You know my rage is growing
You know my hate is deep
I am so cold inside
And you're not the one I wish
I feel down again
But you don't understand
'Cause you don't know
Who I am
You kill me
Before I can explain
How I feel inside
Against me
You turn
Indifferent to my pain
Indifferent to my tears
You kill me
You take my life away
You push me down
Against me
You turn
Indifferent to my pain
Indifferent to my tears
I don't know how to feel now
Inside
My mind is changing
I don't want to believe that
You kill
My feelings for nothing
I don't believe you will hurt me
Again
'Cause I'm growing and changing
Anyway I won't let you
Destroy
What I save from your foolish game
Nohing stays the same and nothing
will come back
But I don't forget you have hurt me
There's nothing left to fight for
No one to comply
With your wishes and with your absurdity
When I've closed my eyes
Not to see your face
And I've stopped to trust in you
Then I've plugged my ears
Not to hear your words
And I've guessed right you too
Had to face it out
With all of your force
But you couldn't know the truth
Yes I didn't open my heart to you
'Cause my heart is broken too
I won't be there
When memories will come back to you
And I won't be there
'Cause memories will come back for you
Touch me with your hands now
Let me feel these things
I never felt before
Look me in the eyes now
Let me see these things
I never saw before
Walk with me forever
Yeah walk with me forever
I don't want more
Touch me with your hands now
Oh let me feel these things
I never felt before
Find the reason to believe in me
Find the nerve to tell me what you feel
I just wanna be the friend you need
You take me on
And I think
You will always be my
Energy and extasy my energy
I need you to take me on
And I think
You will always be my
Energy
I never will forget your love
Extasy
A strange emotion on my own
Energy
It comes from everything you know
Energy
That's what you're giving me
I need you to
Take me on
And now I think you
Will always be
My secret dream 'cause
You badly won my soul
And now I think
You will always be my
Ebergy and extasy
I believe in myself
I believe in my skills
All I have to do is to change my life
Living it in a better way
I can begin to dream again
Everyday
Cleaning out my past from my mind
Wanna be somebody yeah
Not living in the shade
Beginning to smile again yeah
Now everything is alright
Everything in my life
Seems to be so fine
And if you don't believe me baby
I don't care
I don't forget the eyes
Of a man who cried
For your stupid lies
I couldn't save my mind
I never had that chance
Here's nothing I can change
I have to try again
I can feel you
With my hands I touch you
Oh my ru
Can't you feel me
In your water can't you see
Like I do
When I found you
For the first time I thought
 You are my Ru 
Don't you know
That I left it all for you
My Ru
I can feel you
With my hands I touch you
Oh my Ru
'Cause you are my Ru
Now I feel
I have to flow away
In you
And I feel
I have to follow you
My Ru
Yes I feel
a soul with no ligth searching for a sell
the creature god really wanted to forget
a forgotten soldier without wars
Look at my face
no say no
my gods called man
My lonely arms embrace the fields
the fields sweet purgatory
iÃÂ´m the owner oh the fields
were men have planted loneliness
The scarecrow
iÃÂ´m the scarecrow
fucking the scarecrow
a lost soul imprisioned in a fake body
scarecrow
iÃÂ´m the scarecrow
no coward lion on my way
iÃÂ´m the scarecrow
scarecrow
no girl called dorothy and no tin man
and fuck damy yellow brick road for me to take
im the scarecrow
iÃÂ´ve got no pain iÃÂ´ve got no god

cover his face with the hands
in the hole were my eyes wold be
in its botton lies a lith
if you look closely
iÃÂ´ll be in you and you and youÃÂ´ll be in me
alone
imprisioned

imprisioned

iÃÂ´me the owner oh these fields

The Hipocritical Tears of the losers

the ground were i belong now
my soul is free thereÃÂ´s no more pain
there are just questions
Anymore
It is night at the chemical terminal
Storage are gorgotte'n in the dark
Computers alert a sudden deflaction
Making thousand of rottening corpses
Toxin Diffusion
Take of the oxigen
Toxin Diffusion
Corroding my brainsI see ghosts dancing
On burning ice
Speechless and motionless
The realm of longing
Tear all crosses from their stalks
Nothing to be seen
I rise and smile at the ascending moon
Greenish cold blackened lake
Like an eye
Staring up into the sky
The lake just begins to freeze
The woods were like a poisonous spring
For pagans who danced around the fire
Like wicked dark creatures
All through the night it raged
Those hellish festivities
Descend among the damned
Bring fiends all over hell
Still alive but never to die again
Never ever to sleep
The ghost moon a world of halflight
In which great upthrusts of primeval rock
Showed as black velvet blobs
Against a creamcolored background
The moon's hidden face
Through the lunar night
The scarred face of the moon
Of unwary mariners
Licking smoothly as the beads of mist
Under the hellish retrofire
Of the circular eye of Mare Crisium
And the Marsh of Sleep
The flat bed of the sea of Tranquility
Under retrofire
The distant domes of the Sinus Medii
Like small silver blobs
Against the grayish mantle
Where lay the dread Ocean of Storms
filled with muted sounds
With a steady whisper
A bizarre forest of rock
That lay naked an raw
Under the lunar skies
A scene since the beginning of time
Beyond
Where the shadows lie thick
Like layer after layer of dust of darkness
Settled over generations
Lost in the immensity of the cold
Unearthly landscape
Black crags cleft with chasms
A vast cult of wizards
New sense of unreality
Harassments of the self
To relieve its cosmic ennui
Paraphernalia
The goat
So carefully curried and groomed
The pentagram
The five pointed star
Synthesi kai aposynthesi kosmwn kai ontwn
Nekra tis texnis symbola
There where dark embraces the lost souls
Taken from unholy acts in real life
Dead symbols of art
The mighty mother smiles
Over her fleeing her starscattered brood
As nigh falls over Yaddith at the end
We hurtle through the frigid gloom of space
To Zaoth or Shaggai or Kythamil
Leaving behind the ruin of a world
And little hope have we to long survive
The awful doom of Yaddith we evade
Will soon be snuffling at our heels again
When fires blaze forth on the skies
When the black goat appeareth before men
The minions of ye black goat
La ShubNiggurath
Crossover into another world
A world beyond ordinary experience
Where the pale wash of starlight threw shadows
Beyond both ends of the known visible spectrum
This is a new beginning
In the mysterious world beyond mortal eyes
The next dimension of living
From the invisible realms of life
Death is the end of one phase of life
And the beginning of another
All pain and sorrow are gone
Astral travel journeys in the levitation
Hold me close in your thoughts
For one last embrace
There are cycles to be completed
Help me rise
Toward gray snowclad peaks
The sun was descending
Into haze over the mountains
As if with blood
Far to the north rose enormous snowy peaks
Red tinged in a wan light like cold thrones
The shadow
To taste of providing revelations
They are raised above by their same nature
To develop unused powers
The awakening of inner lethargical powers
The frozen ones real estates
Cloudless nights the harsh grate of the sky
Gaze at its thousand winking eyes
Gaze and think and listen
Wait for a whisper
From beyond the blaze of lights
From beyond the gulfs of darkness
And gazed in dreams under the glory of the moon
Sounds creeping from the woods
Beneath the pale light
Rain falling in the trees
Under a cloudless sky
Silver moon barely peeking over the crests
Of the most distant trees
Mere arts of illusion
Reflecting the light from the moon and stars
Into the night the grate of the sky
Wavering in its shroud of darkness
Flesh gleaming under the moonlight
Crawling along the ground
Eyes bright and glassy
A glory to behold
The apocalypse of the seven thunders
An excised passage from revelation
Elements of fantasy
Over the sea of lights
The lonely voice of the stars
At the quietness of the world at a dawn
Suppressed prophesy
The key to the bottomless pit
Unsealed the abyss
Mourn the dead
The sky commenced to darken
Taking on a sheen
From beyond the gulfs of darkness
Mourn the dead
Like the formless fears of nightmare
The cold stars gleamed down
Under the slim horns of a crescent moon
Wave a magic wand and bring order out of chaos
Sakkuth the king  Sakkuth king of night
The stargod
Cursed by the ancient prophets
Worshipped by sorcerers
And savages and demons
The seed of Kaiwan the stargod
Descended from the sky
Long before mankind arose
From the starry voids
From the dark planet which circles the goatstar
For countless aeons
Served by countless demonspawn
And waiting to spawn again
Before dawn
Open the gate to HaragKolath
And perform the rite
Open the gate to thy world
Great mother
Witness this rite to the glory
The gate to other realms
On a journey into the sea of consciousness
Into its volume and into its depths
Awakening spiritual realisation of divine forces
Of inner power and strength
Standing in beautiful sandy cove
With high rocks and cliffs
The kingdom of the heavenly realm
Of seven immense energy fields
The vision of the seven spirits
Seven flames of fire burning
Singing under the moonlight
And blowing wisps of swirling
The lap of the black sea upon the golden sand
The golden light a reflection of the moon
Dark upon the waters
Full of illusions full of discovers
Full of illusions
Of beauties and treasures
Whispers of the stealthy attendants
Voices rising in the brooding darkness
In times of massive death and disaster
Men of broader intellect
In realms apart from the visible world
When the silver and sable of late twilights
Burned state
In the distance lay the still waters
Of a vast lake with the smooth
Glittered cruelly in the cloudless heavens
The incantation for opening the way
Fragmentary race memories
A veritable paroxysm of feverish activity
Lifted in shining grandeur towards the heavens
That come from some earlier life
Bemused minds
Wake up soldier and prepare your fight
Take up your weapon to defend your dreams
But your dreams are weapons in hands of others
Ideals incite anger but confound the mind
A normal day of war
Or day of life what are you living
Heeding your heroes
What would you do
Spill blood kill those like you
But your seated hero is he true or false
Raise yourself soldier it is only a fleshwround
A small obstacle can't stop your dreams
Every day a war every day of life
Look your friends are falling
No longer shines that sun food of dreams
While you fight don't close your eyes
or your sun will arrive at
Sunset
Rekindling my flames
Your velvet touch fills the room with my moaning
Come to me now
My white knight
Why do your hands tighten on my neck
It may break
Don't be afraid
I fire and pray that the eye of some pitying God
I fire and I kill him the monster dies
Looking at the inert body you fall into remorse
A demon falls suffering as the angels die
And your God also cries when a demon dies
It's not killing that annihilates he who kills
Take me away
The abyss of temptation is open wide before me
Don't hesitate
Demons cry
Forget it
I see my image reflected in you
Why don't you talk to me
I understand the emptiness in your mind
What are you my brother
Reflection of man's fear
For the coming of darkness
There is a dream to realize
Immortal
Created by a race which believe
That the light will shine
Immortal
I want to feel what you feel
I'm afraid I'll see only a shell
You hold me and a tear runs down your face
You're trembling but I can't understand
In my sleep convulsive shocks assault my body
But tomorrow cannot begin over again
Silent ghost surround me and whisper
All the visions that my mind draws
Desolation and pain
Too tearful eyes that fix on nothing
A cold wind my flow of tears
My scream echos
In the quiet valley
Among the silent shadows
In my inside
Everything I remember
Every face every look
Unforgotten suffering
Reminiscence
But tomorrow cannot begin over again
My outline design
In the pouring rain
My bloody hands
My pale face
Millions of voices
Every face every look
Unforgotten suffering
Reminiscence
Look around you everything seems calm
Look more deeply be aware of the pain
Powerful hands play every day
With the strings of puppets
Images and words deviate
The empty mind from reason
People follow everyday blindness
Like a sign from within
Trembling voice
Feel the fear but survive the abyss
Different doesn't mean worse
Trembling voice
Behind every corner behind every door
So you choose to go ahead
Like a sign from within
Trembling voice
Feel the fear but survive the abyss
You must follow the only road
Trembling voice
Running in the rivers of immense loneliness
The water its voice its dance only friends
The breath that lives mists my look
Pale moon where are you
Shining snow is melting in my hands
And pours her tears on the searing stone
No trying to escape now it's too late
Hold me tightly my spirit could die
Dimension where I'm going is unknown
In what image can I discover my sensations
In the sky of a cold winter of fallen stars
I cry I die
But maybe it's my face that doesn't know itself
The sad lights of the weeping winter
Breathing the colours of an ending
Imagine the end and bare trees
Like pale skeletons that speak no more
The icy season has made bare
That which you really are you didn't know
The voices of children I'll hear no more
Sometimes i feel like a moth to a flame
we live we die
and still we don't know why
Sometimes i feel the stone of Cain
the rain the sea
won't wash the blood on me
I'm walking on the tight rope
bowing at the empty chairs
that shade into the darkness
Is anybody out there
Sometimes you guess you're a prayer left undone
too thick to fly too thin to fall and die
You're walking on the tight rope
like a thousand times before
surrounded by the silence
You're walking on the tight rope
surrounded by the wall
of a thousand bolted doors
I used to dream we'd meet one day
and find a place called home
but still the rope goes on and on
Do we live to walk alone
I'm walking on the tight rope
like a thousand times before
surrounded by the silence
You're dancing on the tight rope
don't know what you're fighting for
Do we live to walk alone
I feel the wind that cools
my knees on the ground
a storm blast chases me
trees bend to the dawn
I went across the time
and all in a glance
I went across the time
and all in a whisper
A clear sky in my hands
the morning on the cliff
the dews of the night on my skin
It was a full moon night
one of those night that might go on forever
The mist was dancing on the stone floor
of the strange medieval square
a silent wind entangled through the archways
was ringing with the sound of distant steps
A minute or a century later
the man was in the middle of the space
It was a special night
the strangest night from now until forever
Then a cloud concealed the moon
and when the sky was lit again
the Mad Jester in a hood
stood beside the roving man
and though his eyes were shining
the man took on step back
because his lips were smiling
of a smile that chills to death
i was waiting for you
for it's time to begin
we've got something to do
I guess you know what I mean
Why should I listen
to the idle things you say
Tell me one only reason
or get out of my way
It's written in your name
It's screaming from your voice
You were born to play the Game
D'you still think you have a choice
So the man stood up in silence
while the jester took a band
then He wrapped it on his eyes and
put a gun in his hand
Within a century by now
I'll throw a coin in the air
from somewhere hereabout
you have to venture when and where
It's the coin of Good and Evil
It's the Guardian of the Dreams
If you get it with your one shot
you'll be free
The man was left alone
within his darkest world
and soon the deafening silence
was broken by a crowd
They crawled against his feet
they swarmed around his body
and all of them were blindfold
and covered with a shroud
On your own you have no hope
Give the weapon to your Pope
Listen to a Nobel Prince
I can do it with closed eyes
I'm your favourite politician
don't you shoot without permission
Need an expert here I am
I'm a military man
The square was full of voices
and faces of undead
a hundred million noises
resounded in his head
go awayStay far from me
You don't even let me be
Many years have passed by then
an still the night goes on
The full moon shines above the man
reflected in his gun
One day the man will break the spell
one day the man will see
that when he claimed to be himself
and when he strained to be himself
and when he chose to be himself
he was already free
Once more I left the labyrinth of madness
I acted the part within the mirror
Don't be mistaken
about what you are seeing
are you acting as yourselves
or are you wearing someone else's dress
The curtain rises
Only here only now
I'm the one I want to be
at last I am myself
Open your minds
Come in let the farce begin
The curtain rises
And the time is still
Rain and Mist embrace the cliff
they hide the trees
and cover the meadows
Lady Shore is getting stroked
by the warm touch
of warping water
And the time is still
Reefs are dipping in the sea
and seagulls sleep
inside their shelters
The almighty Wind
has flown away
the air is dark the sullen sky
And the time is still
I am sitting on the oak root
Oldman winter sist aside me
we look each other in the eyes
to seek something yet unknown
And the time is still
and the time stands still
How many are
the colors of the ocean
How many are
the songs of the birds
All of my life was spent
in search for emotion
And the time is still
and the time stands still
as the smell of damp
grass crawls from the heart
of salty earth
Runya's waiting at the harbour
for the journey of tomorrow
but before I leave my land I need
to stay here for a while
i will reap the sounds
and harvest the images
of the landscape
I will dream of once again
I will dream them once again
Walking slowly not to slide
on the rocks wet dew
Ben Rowi asked himself if he'd be able
of falling in a twilight world
The branches the different shades of green
the dead yellow leaves made him feel at home
laying in the underbrush
his stare toward the sky
he talked with the silence
I didn't hope you'd come
I couldn't be missing
it doesn't chanc every day
to meet a madman who wants
to know the small people
You can find yoursekf in the kingdom of fairies
if you swallow a primrose
Everything had suddenly become queer
the rain poured upside down
the pools reflected several moons
I sawheavenly creatures
dancing around dancing around
I joined them
Pay attention it's
a fay circle
don't dance with themyou might
Don't worry  it's funny
The dance was getting more and more frantic
I realized that time was flyin' away
I was an old man
During the dance time runs quicly
minute last for years
If you give me your eyes
I'll open your mind
and you'll discover the secrets
of the small people
I don't know how it came
I was made of steam
i was whirling in the air
I was ruling the skies
Maybe the fairy had joked me
maybe I was deadut death was not so bad
I was captured in a black hole
I woke up into the underbrush
I had finally fallen in a twilight world
but something seemed different
I wasnow I am
I didn't hope you'd come
Leaves are falling around
Drops of rain I smell the rain
keep on climbing
upon the misty mountain
waiting for
Catch the wind if you're still alive
catch the flowers
the water and the sun
catch the wind if you're still alive
Leaves are falling around
Dance all night
around the sleepy lake
waste no time
the moon is high
the season of forever
waiting for
The Dragon Knight will be as one with the Dragon
The Dragon Knight will fly as the Dragon
He will skim the night woods with eyes of Ithil
The Knight will dwell in the Wings of Evil
He will hold the Might of Anor
He will know the Ancients Wisdom
You've gone too far
Now tell me who the fuck
Do you think you are
Yeah I did all the work
And you still don't understand
Sitting here alone
With a drink in my hand
I don't want it I don't need it
Can't believe
If you want to fuck around
Just get up and leave
When the darkness starts to hold me
It is time for me to pray
Another night has gone
Another day will come
Another morning light
Take the chance to fight  break of dawn
You're making me sick
And you're telling me lies
It's taken too long to open my eyes
It's the final curtain
It's come to an end
There's no way you can pretend
When the darkness starts to hold me
It is time for me to pray
Another night has gone
Another day will come
Another morning light
Take the chance to fight  break of dawn
Try to tell me I was nothing
Try to tell me I was none
Try to show them I was something
One day I'll be number one
Still you try to pull me under
Still you try to shoot me down
Like a man I took a to stand
And learn to hold my head up high
And that's the reason why
No one can deny
I can show you
What you see ain't always really what you get
Anyone can be a hero
Try to stop me from believing
Try to take my dreams away
Still my ground I wasn't leaving
I will show them all one day
Still you try to pull me under
Still you try to shoot me down
Like a man I took a stand
And learn to hold my head up high
And that's the reason why
No one can deny
I can show you
What you see ain't always really what you get
Anyone can be a hero
What you see ain't always really what you get
Anyone can be a hero
We all thought they were crazy
No they'd never get that
Strange thing off the ground
Guess our vision was hazy
Cos they showed us all
And in a wink of an eye
They took to the sky
Yeah the world was wrong
The brothers were Wright
And it caused a big sensation
Yeah the world was wrong
The brothers were Wright
Cos they gave us aviation
They were the talk of the nation
And the crowds turned out
To witness for themselves
This new elevation
The folks stood in awe
And by the end of the day
They were all blown away
Yeah the world was wrong
The brothers were Wright
And it caused a big sensation
Yeah the world was wrong
The brothers were Wright
Cos they gave us aviation
Another empty feeling I just can't believe
That I miss your warmth thought you never leave
Gotta stop this sad and endless pain
Let the sunshine come into my life again
Gotta stop this hard and senseless rain
I'm lighting up  eternal flame
I'm standing at the edge of nowhere
Don't know where to turn
I know I got all before me
There's so much left to learn
Gotta stop this sad and endless pain
Let the sunshine come into my life again
Gotta stop this hard and senseless rain
I'm lighting up  eternal flame
Wish you were here to help me through
I need your helping hand
Standing here and losing ground
Like shifting sand
Gotta stop this sad and endless pain
Let the sunshine come into my life again
Gotta stop this hard and senseless rain
I'm lighting up  eternal flame
Gotta stop this sad and endless pain
Let the sunshine come into my life again
Gotta stop this hard and senseless rain
I'm lighting up  eternal flame
I see these strange illusions
A great dream is coming true
You caught me staring at you
I can't take my eyes off you
No need for talking anymore
I know you want it too
Like a moth to the light
I'm allured by you
Its growing so much stronger
Passion's flying high
Can't wait any longer
To start playing with tire
Another sin  Skin to skin
Skin to skin  Where pleasure meets desire
Take me in  Skin to skin
Skin to skin  Playin' with fire
Electrified by a touch a paralyzing stare
Wanting you oh so much
There's magic in the air
You look at me and I'm getting hot
I look at you and you play it cool
The place is good and the time is right
To feel your heat tonight
Its growing so much stronger
Passion's flying high
Can't wait any longer to start playing with fire
Another sin  Skin to skin
Skin to skin  Where pleasure meets desire
Take me in  Skin to skin
Skin to skin  Playin' with fire
Is it love that I'm feeling
You're the one you're in control
Feels like I am dreaming
So many years have passed
We've been up and down
Now we're hack at last
Gonna take the crown
All this time we couldn't let it go
Call on me we'll take it slow
Oh my God we can't stop now
Don't even try we're ready to blow
Walls fall down
Rock them to the ground
Walls fall down
Lose control and give in to the sound
So you like heavy
All around the clock
Hard yet steady
We're hungry to rock
You like it rough
We play it hard
Can't get enough
We won't let you down
Were ready to rock
Walls fall down
Rock them to the ground
Walls fall down
Lose control and give in to the sound
We are the sound and the light in the dark
We all just came here to rock
Walking down that alley
Deep inside your soul
Feeling like a lonesome rat
Trapped in a dirty hole
So stand up  again
Raise your fist
Get out of the mist
Don't give in to pain
That cuts you like a knife
Leave the past behind
Get back into life
Come back  for good
Come back  for good
The burdens that you had to bear
Were a heavy load
Break the chains and free your mind
Life is an open road
So stand up  again
Raise your fist
Get out of the mist
Don't give in to pain
That cuts you like a knife
Leave the past behind
Get back into life
Come back  for good
Come back  for good
I'm heavy duty
I'm a power pack
An everlasting fuse
Ready to attack
I'm full of energy
Like a battery
Put the pedal to the metal
Full speed ahead the only way to be
Like a loaded gun I'm ready
Pull the trigger set me free
Power Pack  on a high speed track
Power Pack  like a cannonball
Power Pack  gonna give it all
Power Pack  Power Pack
I'm a global player
And I've been energized
I'm a power cell
And I'm oversized
Supersonic madman
Fast and furious
I'm an accelerator
Now tell me baby are you curious
Like a loaded gun I'm ready
Pull the trigger set me free
Power Pack  on a high speed track
Power Pack  like a cannonball
Power Pack  gonna give it all
Power Pack  Power Pack
Scarlet snow is falling
From the wounded sky
A forsaken love is gonna die
All alone and knowing
It's more than meets the eye
I can't go on living this lie
Words can't describe
The way I feel
Is there a cure
For my heart to heal
I've been stranded on the edge of time
Don't know why we are here
Silent crying in the pouring rain
Where is it all supposed to end
The sunless sky
Looks like a sea above
I tried to turn the tide with love
Words can't describe
The way I feel
Is there a way
For my heart to heal
I've been stranded on the edge of time
Don't know why we are here
Silent crying in the pouring rain
Where is it all supposed to end
A guiding star
So close but yet so far away
Shining on for me
To light my darkest day
Locked in my darkness
With visions of demons in my mind
A world full of blackness
Making light hard to find
Was so close to madness
Chasing those ghosts around
Just fighting my sadness
Feeling that help can't be found
And then the sun came out
Sun came out  Driving the clouds away
Sun came out  Yeah the sun came out
Then the sun came
Turning my nightmare into day
Then the sun came out
Shrouded in blindness
Forced to believe the chips were down
With no sign of kindness
And silence the only sound
Was so close to madness
Chasing those ghosts around
Just fighting my sadness
Feeling that help can't be found
And then the sun came out
Sun came out  Driving the clouds away
Sun came out  Yeah the sun came out
Then the sun came
Turning my nightmare into day
Then the sun came out
Don't go under
When rain and thunder
Seek to plunder
The sunshine from your life
We're playing to win
A driving force in us all
No one can deny it
We all want to succeed
And the world spins
Fast forward in highspeed
It s never good enough
We've always got to seek for more
Rising up high
Adventure is calling
Learning to fly
Taking your chances
Rising up high
Where the eagles are soaring
Higher and higher we fly
Touch the sky
A feeling of freedom
We are looking for peace of mind
No one seems to look back
At what we all have achieved
Open your eyes
Everything is preconceived
It's never good enough
We always got to seek for more
Rising up high
Adventure is calling
Learning to fly
Taking your chances
Rising up high
Where the eagles are soaring
Higher and higher we fly
Touch the sky
Over and over again we sow
Seeds of reasons to be
Over and over again we grow
Who is now holding the key
One step at a time and we will see
You lie awake
Toss and turn at night
You're all done
For goodness sake
In love again
But you've got a heart of stone
You'll cross the line
You'll break the chains
You'll do whatever it will take
Still you will always be
The one for me
It's the driving force
You're the power source
All I think of
It's the driving force
So don't change the course
It's the bond of our love
Calling your name
In the pouring rain on my own
Who is to blame
Who can I trust
When pain is all I've ever known
You'll cross the line
You'll break the chains
You'll do whatever it takes
Still you will always be
The one for me
It's the driving force
You're the power source
All I think of
It's the driving force
So don't change the course
It's the bond of our love
Blood to free a soul you'll dwell here no more
Blood to free a soul you'll dwell here no more
Can you hear me I call to you
As sure as the air I know you are there
Only a breath of life separates us now
Blood to free a soul you'll dwell here no more
Blood to free a soul

Feeling the fire the funeral pyre
With visions of death in your mind
Destructive power the flames make you cower
The smoke burns your life falls behind
Step in the shadows beneath the gallows
Inviting you into cold sleep
Final words spoken and bodies are broken
Just throwing the rest on the heap
Stand and bear witness to all of the victims
Flung into the pit with a grin
Something is waiting to see death congregating
Strike up the fire once again
Past is confronted the holy are hunted
Compassions forgotten today
In the town square the stench of burned hair
The memory just wont go away
Pack your belongings the heat is alarming
Time to leave this evil place
Hot on your trail to bag you have failed
Dominions of night giving chase
Sun will not rise with all of the lies
Darkness descends in the end
No one is learning bodies are burning
Putting the knife to your friend
On cremation day cremation
On cremation day cremation
On cremation day cremation
On cremation day
Daylight receding in flames nightmares breeding
Reflections and boiling pools of blood
Step over ruins that might have been human
Broken bones lying in the mud
Life takes a vacation from this desecration
And demons fall out of the sky
Death's burning fire makes all of us liars
And most of us never know why
Sun will not rise with all of the lies
Darkness descends in the end
No one is learning bodies are burning
Putting the knife to your friend
On cremation day cremation
On cremation day cremation
On cremation day cremation
On cremation day
On cremation day 
Open your eyes and see the light
Close your eyes to the pain
Children run away to play another day
Sacrificial pit world has turned to shit
Crushing wall of dead the image in your head
A bloody ritual you are a fucking fool
You realize too late its time to see your fate
Don't want your pity lay me in the dirt
I leave this world not caring who I hurt
Don't want your pity lay me in my grave
My life is over
No matter where you turn your gonna fucking burn
Or you will lose control your sacrilegious soul
Bullets raining down and evil warlike sound
Nightmare comes alive there is no where to hide
Riots in the street the faceless dead will meet
Dreams of Damnation demonic celebration
Don't want your pity lay me in the dirt
I leave this world not caring who I hurt
I don't want your pity lay me in my grave
My life is overthere's nothing left to save
Open your eyes to the painpainpainpain
Cruelty after cruelty my heart is dead and cold
A soul so cold and barren Evillution
Repent is not an option I ask for no reprieve
I die tonight
Forget me I am gone for good this time
You might live to see the light not me my friend
I die tonight
Forget me I am gone for good this time
I die tonight
Forget me I am gone for good this time
Yes I'll be a responsible member
of this great and bless'd society
I've come to understand the wrongful nature
of gun ownership in the age of monarchy
But sometimes it's just so hard
to act like the person you weren't born to be
Felonious behavior Countless misdemeanors
Impersonating an officer of the law
Bonafide man of action How you like that
Bonafide man of action How you like that
You can't stop you can't stop progress
You cant's stop you can't stop no no no
You can't stop you can't stop progress
You cant's stop you can't stop no no no
I understand there's no victimless crimes
That being said I feel rather victimized
And I will seek substantial compensation
Whether legally legalish or otherwise
But sometimes it's such a hassle
Felonious behavior Countless misdemeanors
Impersonating an officer of the law
Bonafide man of action How you like that
Bonafide man of action How you like that
You can't stop you can't stop progress
You cant's stop you can't stop no no no
You can't stop you can't stop progress
You cant's stop you can't stop no no no
Diplomatically emphatically deny
any prior knowledge shape or kind
You don't know nothing about a Russian hooker
Some bloke broke in and straight up took her
They're bloody relentless
Call the consulate and burn the evidence
Don't speak another word just burn the evidence
Get your hands off me you don't know who I am
I'm a power player I'm a power player
Get your hands off me you don't know who I am
I'm a power player I'm a power player
The devil and me had a falling out
Violation of contract beyond a shadow of a doubt
Wherever he go whomever he meet
hanging his head in a hard rain
Where I'm headed I don't know
Down this path we all go
Grace and luck blood from stone
Got nowhere to call my home
What comes around goes around threefold or more
Now you can't get off of that killing floor
The devil and me bad blood and beef
An undisciplined child a liar and a thief
What comes around goes around threefold or more
Now you can't get off of that killing floor
Gotta get off of that killing floor
Only the dirt I do believe
As memory vanishes among the leaves
Cradled in ivy we will allow
the moss to prosper upon our brows
Only the dirt I do believe
Divinity vanishes among the leaves
Child of the city Mother of the Earth
Baptism by firefly pinch a parson's purse
Queen of Cups the Joker's blade is old and dull
Child of the City
Yet it slices us with the nicest miracles
Babe in the Wilderness Father of Creation
Spinning of the wind the gathering of nations
Professor on the Toadstool convene your class
Babe in the wilderness
In absentia please show your hands
And your feet Are you touched by a beast
False idol raiser play the town
Count up your blessings and melt it down
Immortal Dominator Governor of the World
Sic semper tyrannis The Fisher and the Pearl
The bearer of this letter is a charlatan
Immortal Dominator
In absentia please show your hands and your feet
And your feet Are you touched by a beast
False idol raiser play the town
Count up your blessings and melt it down
All your money now kid All your money now kid

Well you made me weep and you made me moan
When you caused me to leave child my happy home
I get satisfaction everywhere I go
Where I lay my head  that's where I call home
Whether barren pines or the mission stare
Bang bang bang bang Vamanos vamanos
Bang bang bang Vamanos vamanos
You told everybody in the neighborhood
what a dirty mistreater That I was no good
Doctor or lawyer I'll never be
Life of a drifter  only life for me
You can have your riches all the gold you saved
Bang bang bang bang Vamanos vamanos
Bang bang bang Vamanos vamanos
If I had money like Henry Ford
Lord I'd have me a woman yeah on every road
Invocation of the dummies requiem for a head
Cash in at the corner piles of street cred
I get satisfaction everywhere I go
One day baby you'll worry me no more
Bang bang bang bang Vamanos vamanos
Bang bang bang Vamanos vamanos
In the inner chambers of the president
You will find no crosses only pentagrams
1600 today's our day
I been working like a pack mule every day
And to think that some of it ends up that way
1600 today's our day
Went to the doctor to see what could be given
Went to the pastor to hear what he would say
Churchyard was empty schoolyard was bare
Wind in the streets wind in the air
Pockets of diamonds nothing to buy
Scream out hello and get no reply
Victims of zombies convene in the park
While any man with dignity makes an easy mark
How manycools of Addom Party cools of stone
Hart of the wood shudder Eusa roam
Shadows and phantom's convene in the snow
Among the low whispers are voices you know
How manycools of Addom Party cools of stone
Hart of the wood shudder Eusa roam
How's that hardcore fanzine Still take the piss
Y and T got records demos on cassette
Summer of the seven inch Too cool for school
I feel the spirit moving over me
There are clouds beneath my feet
When vegans attack on ten speed bikes
Tattoos with meaning American Spirit Lights
Congressional and DCPD
Lafayette Park undercovers
The saddest sight you ever see ever see
I feel the spirit moving over me
There are clouds beneath my feet
When vegans attack on ten speed bikes
Tattoos with meaning American Spirit Lights 
Copious note taker American Spirit Lights
I feel the spirit moving over me
I feel the spirit moving over me
There are clouds beneath my feet
When vegans attack on ten speed bikes
Tattoos with meaning American Spirit Lights 
Copious note taker American Spirit Lights
She said take a seat boy and I'll treat you fair
Snake charmers cold infidels get a running start
Opossum minister where you been so long
Families in their den staring at the box
Opossum minister hen done killed the fox
Eyes like clouds know you stare
Count the minutes by the rocking of chairs
Prathertown unincorporated
The masterplan unfolds silent sinister

Eyes like clouds know you stare

Money Mike Pistol Pete
both went running down the street
Police and snitches lover's lane
Hot summer Hot rain
Hit the bricks
The girl got her tricks
She's the Mississippi terror
and there's none the fairer
OTB was jammed
Paper changing hands
Nothing left but smoke and cellar
And a Woman with a black umbrella
Little Lewis lost his shit
10 to 1 couldn't collect
Fish Head Phil Itchy Ike
say they never got home that night
Shake the breaker
That girl ain't no money maker
She's come to cook all the books
and flaunt her good looks
OTB was jammed
Paper changing hands
Nothing left but smoke and cellar
And a Woman with a black umbrella
Don't let this summer go to waste
The enemy is preparing their children are you
Time to show them who's boss
Tell me why Dick Cheney underneath my bed
Hell no that ain't cool
Tendin' to the lips of a shrunken head
No sir that ain't cool
Come on now take one for the team
Stick it to the man stick it to the man
Raise the dagger high above Isaac
drive it down as hard as you can
Shiny Master Cadillackness halos suit you well
Shiny Master Cadillackness halos suit you well
Father father don't want to wear your uniform
Mary Mary keep me safe and comforted
Shiny Master Cadillackness halos suit you well

Shiny Master Cadillackness halos suit you well
Shiny Master Cadillackness halos suit you well
All you ready to prove your love to the Lord
As Abraham handed down his first born on a stone
Do you wonder what is right and what is wrong
We've been counting down your days
Going over every false THING YOU SAY
We wish it could be different
We wished you stayed the same
Tearing down our idols
living life OUR OWN WAY
Taking the chance to say
All my heros are dead
All my heros are dead
But we can't help but feel
Empty words they're all you gave
Struggling to take back our days
They build you up to watch you fall
Can't you see they can't be what you want
You build them up to watch them fall
Where did we lose control
We thought it'd last forever
We're come and count away your days
well that's what I thought
you always finish before we start
don't have to say a word
living for these moments
who's been let down
who's been dragged down
been through this so many times before
eats me inside
out of this world you know
trapped inside so many nights alone
I have to know
WHAT'S INSIDE YOUR HEART
WHAT'S INSIDE YOUR HEART
promises have been made
I've been let down
what's inside your heart
we search and we search for
the answers worth fighting for
GO
I have to get out break out
I can't be you
who's been let down
who's been dragged down
been through this so many times before
eats me inside
out of this world you know
trapped inside so many nights alone
seems now I'm in too deep
and it's never going to be the same
this is me take it or leave
cuz it's never going to feel the same
I can't be you
This is our city of the dead
Another life holds its weary head
We hope we try we live survive
Counting days trying to get by
Waiting for the calling
Anticipation in the air
We hope and dream of difference
City sleeping unaware
Break the silence WAKE THE DEAD
Running through these streets alone
I'll kick and scream let's break the hold
Cuz I swear and this won't render useless
I promise you we've come this far
And I'm not stopping I'm not stopping now
I'm not hiding in shadows
Wake up
Send out this message it's clear
You said you said you said
this time was gonna be different
WAKE UP THE DEAD
Coming alive
Something stirs inside
This isn't over yet
Shake off the dirt
Swallow regret
Stop living under the weight
Living under the weight of regret
Your regrets
DON'T LOSE HOPE
Don't let it happen to you
DON'T LOSE HOPE
Which side are you gonna choose
Cuz I believe I believe it's in you RISE
We said we said we said
This time was gonna be different
WAKE UP THE DEAD
So here I go again
We had our chance
half smile you look my way
run now and some might say
We all die alone
We all die alone
We all die alone
And I'll never forget what killed us
she screams to be alone
Going over it in my head
What's left what's left to say
We all die alone
We all die alone
We all die alone
Can we ever take back the nights
the nights we wasted on another fight
Does this really all end tonight
Does this really all end tonight
This is the rest
This is the rest of our lives alone
Can we ever take back the nights alone
Does this really all end tonight alone
TAKE BACK OUR NIGHTS
TAKE BACK OUR NIGHTS
TAKE BACK OUR NIGHTS
Take back our nights
your debt's escalating
whisper no regrets
run your mouth in circles
chewing chewing the flesh
your talk is cheap and it's going nowhere
think you're out changing the world
choking on each word you spit
those basement dwelling days are so far from me
moving mountains in your head
buying into all that's said
dive sink drown
caught up in this lie
dive sink drown
caught up in this life outside your own
your talk is cheap and it's going nowhere
think you're out changing the world
choking on each word you spit
convinced of your false visions
you're the sucker
KEEP TALKING
keep talking away
KEEP TALKING
cashing in all your petty words
keep talking away
it's so far from me
living like you're dead
I did this to myself
the summer air burning in my lungs
one more glance till I come undone
let's stop this rising sun
bright lights can see
they always shine right through me
leaving me an open book
of halfways and couldhavebeens
taking us to the end end end
and that summer changed us
it's best I admit that to myself
stuck trapped in memories
the tragic tale of you and me
can't get back to the way we were
nothing else mattered
it was us against the world
it was us against the world
always us against the world
now it's just me sucking in that summer air
what a summer I had no care
how quick it all crashed down
not willing to bend bend bend
and these struggles changed us
it's best to admit that to yourself
stuck trapped in memories
the tragic tale of you and me
can't get back to the way we were
nothing else mattered
it was us against the world
that morning came too soon
what were we suppose to do
one choice torn in two
I know what you were put through
and I thought we had it
we didn't have enough
we can't go back
we'll never go back now
THIS IS THE END
THIS IS THE END
This is the end
I want to see you here with me
and I want to tell you what you mean to me
but I'll save this I'll save my breath this time
I think it's almost useless
we both know we both saw the signs
still I am ASKING WHY
ASKING WHY
I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling inside
so is this story over or has it just begun
you can only wonder and we can only wonder
these days have been too much
I hate being stuck in the inbetween
means to an end
me taking your hand and moving us ahead
I wish that it could last
cuz I still feel our past
OUR PAST
will we ever feel this way again
means to and end
close my eyes and I'll be dreaming away
if things were different I'd be able to say
I'm still here
but I'm still here
RETHINKING MY DECISIONS
OUR DISTANCE SEPARATION
and I'm still here
from the start of the day
to the end of the race
we thought we had this all figured out
without a moment to waste
but we choke we choke on our words
we waste all of our days
throw off another year
living our lives is our greatest fear
from being useless to being used
another chance to live PASSED BY US
this on the tip of our tongues
the silence of our lives
but this flame keeps burning
we'll never lay down and die
this isn't hopeless
this isn't hopeless
we'll keep on fighting until the bitter end
this isn't hopeless
this isn't hopeless
we'll carry on
forget about the boundaries
we'll leave the past behind
with every step we take
we'll finally redefine
WE'LL CARRY ON
we are the bright lights
let's not stop shining
this life will always be worth living
from the start of the day
to the end of the race
we thought we had this all figured out
without a moment to waste
WE'LL HAVE OUR WAY
WE'LL HAVE OUR WAY
WE'LL HAVE OUR WAY
we'll have our way
right now I'm feeling useless
it's all the same
it's all the same to me
this curse is growing stronger
this isn't how I thought it would be now
I would pave the way
but I've got nothing to say
thinking out loud
who do you want me to be me
we saw WE HAD A VISION
we heard BUT DIDN'T LISTEN
I never could accept
what they would offer
what they would offer
what they would give
my battle's not against you
I'm fighting with myself
because I'm pulled in each direction
they're all the same with different names
falling apart fall down fall
falling apart fall down fall
falling apart fall down fall
FALLING APART
we can't pretend
we can't pretend
that we've ever been safe
can you hear the sound
believe
believe
BELIEVE
find your reasons beyond
feed the urge take it beyond
BELIEVE
find your reasons beyond
feed the urge take it beyond
I was looking forward to this day for so long
I had it all planned out
I was hoping it'd all work out
I was losing patience
you know it's never been my best trait
counting minutes hours counting days
then it dawned on me
unpredictabilty
I told myself everything's just fine
you worry too much it's gonna eat you alive
I was looking forward to this day for so long
I had it all planned out
I was hoping that it would all work out
would all work out
now I feel exposed
like a black light on the wall
in a darkened room
all the dirt appears
you can see my fears
I don't want to let my guard down
you know I never had the feeling
that you would prey on my insecurities
because I never had the feeling
that you would prey on these insecurities I have
why is this wait taking so long
why is this wait taking so long
counting minutes hours counting days
I'm losing patience
don't think this means I'm walking away
don't think this means I'm walking
I won't let fear get the best of me
now it's up to me I wouldn't change a thing
I won't let fear get the best of me
DON'T THINK THIS MEANS I'M WALKING AWAY
now it's up to me I wouldn't change a thing
DON'T THINK THIS MEANS I'M WALKING AWAY
THIS IS MY FINAL GOODBYE
now I can say it's real
and I can feel the pain
all I do is reason
I wanna change things but I don't have a say
SCREAMING EXPECTATIONS
they've got me by the throat
I'd rather die than bleed
let's forget those things we said
can we erase from our minds
the agony of uncertainty IN OUR LIVES
well I've seen it come and go
and I've had the time
I've had the time of my life
ALL THIS
WITH YOU
trying to be strong
and I've seen the time
I've seen the time go so fast
ALL THIS
WITH YOU
THIS IS MY FINAL GOODBYE
my final goodbye
I'd rather die than bleed
let's forget the things we said
I'd rather die than bleed
let's forget the things we said
I'd rather let this die than bleed

So far away from you
Livin' lovin' I'm on the run
So far away from you

Hello central give me doctor jazz
He's got what I need I'll say he has
When the world goes wrong and I've got the blues
The more I get the more I want it soon
I see doctor jazz in all my dreams
When I'm in trouble bounds are mixed
He's the guy who gets me fixed
Your answer will show  that dead is your king
I look in your eyes  confusion within
You lose all your pride and scream as i bite
In a starlight slaughter  vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter  rise of wolf kind
My Hymn to the moon piercing your mind
Your science will fail
Your eyes turn blind
Starlight slaughter  vengeance will be mine
Starlight slaughter  rise of wolf kind
The first was the last one
The last one to fall
He sounded the warning
And put out the call
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold
Stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
The men on the shoreline
Guardians of old
They prayed for a warning
They ran from the wall
Remorseless invaders or traders with gold
Stand or run
We bring the fire and the flame
Agony and pain
Sword of the ocean carve me your name
Feel  take my hand
See  wasted lands
Cause I lost my fire and its tearing up my soul
Got to fight if I want it
So tired of liars theyre filling me with shame
Got to fight and get stronger
But the road is long and treachery awaits
Valhalla rising  Im taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising  I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire is the seed
Take my hand
No more wasted lands
I restored my fire now its filling up my soul
Even though I was broken
And I fought the liars  the worst of all was me
All the false words Id spoken
As I travelled on I realised my fate
Valhalla rising  Im taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising  I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed
Take my hand
No more wasted lands
And now I finally see what's been revealed
Valhalla rising  Im taking flight
Let Valkyries guide me to my destiny
Valhalla rising  I burn tonight
Let ravens fly and give my soul release
The fire was the seed
Take my hand
Time to reap all the violence they have sewn
Kept you down with their torture
Crushed your bones
From slavery your rebellion screams of fire
Too late 'cause you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder shake the ground
Two thousand years spent imprisoned
You were chained
Born a stallion but broken down  hurt and malmed
A fury and rage ignited in the tears
they'll pay and you'll never be their pawn
You've grown too strong
You're the Storm King
Ride the lightning
Rule the thunder shake the ground
Unleashed by my hate 
Flesh torn away from the bone
A fire that burns  a fever that never subsides
By the silvery sheen 
The moon will decide who will die
I've found the strength to live alone
I've left my kin I've left my home
By silver light I'll carve my own
To last and live my power's grown
Embers  burning runes
Sever the ties  destiny calls
Black sky  silver moon
I'm gonna rise  you're gonna fall
Summoning fire  men of the cross stand aside
A heathen belief  northern revenge is at hand
No masters or kings 
The cry for my freedom resounds
The passion is free 
The bloodcovered snow is the sign
Embers  burning runes
Sever the ties  destiny calls
Black sky  silver moon
I'm gonna rise  you're gonna fall
He's alive  the stories were right
And now there's a lesson to learn
Took his land and curse him as damned
But now he will make them all burn
Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies the shadow's arrived
Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt
Running free the beast inside of me
Will join in his howl to the moon
Every sense come alive
And the passion ignites
'cause his beckoning call brings us doom
Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies the shadow's arrived
Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt
Blood will stain the land
As the hunt will take command
Tonight the grey one's arrived
To reveal all the lies
Blood will spill
I follow the hunt
Chase and kill
Follow the hunt
Blood will spill
We follow the hunt
Chase and kill
We follow the hunt
One night in November my soul found a heart
In glistening frost by the light of the stars
One night in November my soul found its home
In the glow of the moon I was born
All my grief washed away
It's the end of my plight
No mourning was left
Only feral delight
All my grief washed away
By the blood that was shed
In the glow of the moon I was born
Hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Nine days t obring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Eight brings me sight
Seven gives me light
Six days and wounds are healed
Strength has returned
Bless the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
Praise the mighty Thor
Blood will stain your shores
Swear I will return
Prepare yourself for war
I will hide all trace
Count the days
Nine to reach my fate
Swear to return
Nine days to bring the change
Destiny fulfilled
Five proves me right
Four ends the fight
Three two and one completes the change
Then I will rise
You speak of hell and how you fell
Looking out for something new
You broke the law you've seen it all
Really nothing more to tell
Steel will guide you right
You speak of pain and always claim
You never really had a chance
But there's a call to break them all
Listen now or try in vain
Steel will guide you right
Rule them all
Rule with an iron hand or you will fall
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed  put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid web of lies web of lies
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed  put on a pleassant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
Build a solid we b of lies web of lies
What separates us is a plan
There's a wall that separates us and divides
Hide the greed  put on a pleasant smile
Break the fall yet you're ashamed to be alive
All these lines on my face getting clearer 
The past is gone 
It went by like dusk to dawn 
Isn't that the way 
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay 
Yeah I know nobody knows 
Where it comes and where it goes 
I know it's everybody's sin 
You got to lose to know how to win 
Half my life 
Is in books' written pages 
Lived and learned from fools and 
From sages 
You know it's true 
All the things come back to you 
Sing with me sing for the year 
Sing for the laugh sing for the tears 
Sing with me if it's just for today 
Yeah sing with me sing for the year 
Sing for the laugh sing for the tear 
Sing with me if it's just for today 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away 
Dream On Dream On Dream On 
Dream until the dream come true 
Dream On Dream On Dream On 
Dream until your dream comes true 
Dream On Dream On Dream On

Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away 
Sing with me sing for the year 
Sing for the laugh sing for the tear 
Sing with me if it's just for today 
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
I felt so anxious for what we had in store
But then you took that away
For all your dreams and desires
That I couldn't provide
I've got my hopes I'm a fighter
I won't answer what you need answered
I won't say a word I won't say a word
And I won't say a word I won't say anything
Bury me in ecstasy and take the pain away
Oh you've gotta be kidding me 
I won't say a word I won't say a word
And I won't say a word I won't say anything
Bury me in ecstasy and take the pain away
I'm just selfish
I won't retreat 
Now I pray hearts been slain
Tears come down I'm broken down
I'm waiting for my life to end
Dear God please let me leave
Far from home I'm all alone
This soul is way too deep
I've left behind my happy life
And I'm still asking how I died
Lay down Now we pray
Now 
Lay down Now we pray
Now
I'm walking through the cold of night
So I can see your face I can see your face
At your window I will stand
Your smell I will embrace
My eyes in yours and yours in mine
And now I know just how I died
Lay down Now we pray
Now 
Lay down Let me pray I pray
Now Oh
Lay me down Stand back get away
Lay me down Stand back get away
Lay me down Stand back get away
Lay me down Stand back get away
Lay me down Stand back get away
Lay me down Stand back get away
Lay down
Pray now

please just don't cross that line that line
There's nowhere to go to hide
There's nowhere to run tonight
please just don't cross that line 
There's nowhere to go to hide
There's nowhere to run tonight
please just don't cross that line line line
If I was a puppet you'd be my master
If I was a puppetThe wind freezes my bones
While I'm riding through the darkness
Searching by the ruins
Where the Arcadia Gates wait
Old spirits call my name
And show me the way of wizards
Beyond of reality
I'm deep in the nightmare land
Looking at the sky
The dark rainbow
Rises in my fantasies
Mystic globins frightem in the night
Whith your bright eyes
You can't go on
Said one voice in the forest
Welcome to insanity hall where nobody scape
Arcadia Gates
Twilight of lost dreams
Arcadia Gates
No return never more
Arcadia Gates
Mirror of imagination
Arcadia Gates
I'm a foreign in this insane world
Wise an oaks of the wood
Tell me your forgotten secrets
Guiding in the stranger
The Lord of Illusions shades
Take me away from this place
I need come back to my father land
Twilight guardians
Help me to return
I see in the ravings
Galaxies travelling
Across the space and time
Magic fairies
Reveal for me
The holy creation dying
Now I understand
All the questions was the answers
A new life begin
And today I have a second chance
Arcadia Gates
Twilight of lost dreams
Arcadia Gates
No return never more
Arcadia Gates
Mirror of imagination
Arcadia Gates
I'm a foreign in this insane world
One black hole rise
And I fly to my dimension
You will learn the lesson
Arcadia Gates
Twilight of lost dreams
Arcadia Gates
No return never more
Arcadia Gates
Mirror of imagination
Arcadia Gates
I'm a foreign in this insane world
The sands of time
Are running more than speed of light
All dimensions
Are taking us to the same place
The gate is open
And you can see a great new world
Like a dream a red moon shines in the sky
I can feel the emotions growing in my heart
When I see the great world under my eyes
I'm lost and tied in time
I'm living
Beyond hills
Where a castle flies in the high clouds
The knights ride
Across the mountain of black Crystal
In this kingdom
Space and time don't exist
Just nights and days where I will live forever
Long live to the kingdom
Tree cheers to the holy child
All of your power
Will be to reign with might
Loyalty and courage
Your sword will revenge
The oath of the justice
He is the choice of saints
The royal crown of your forefathers
Braveries tell histories across the time
Dynasty and Destiny
The honour is in your face
The wisdom will be the key
the way of great glories
Horns sing a new age
The throne is relic of skies
The temptation of power
Is a dungeon in a dark night
The wisdom are like a dragon
Lord of everything
The holy graal for gods
Hail the king of kings
Tales from the spirit of gold
Hunters come in the night of glory
Prophets lying and creating gods
Proclameting darkness my master fall
Break up point one thunder cry on
Forgotten realms move like a dragons
Fist full of fire and immortal kings
Earth and sea dominion without peace
Monsters and demons spreading in the air
A preacher calling for one great attack
Freedom We don't fall out
Cry On Magic forces on
Spikes shining under sun and moon
Sailing with the night corsaries
Came and fall for black steel crown
Sailing with the night corsaries
We flow in the wind on the seven seas
The purple horizon kill the waters
In deep ocean the galleys lean
Keeping reaches hide for the centuries
King of pirates slaving the coast
Cannons sing the tunne of the battle
Ships are boards with iron and fire
Rum is the fuel for ours desires
Seven seas
Distant skies
Old fortunes
Waiting for us tonight
In the storms
Crossing waves
Bright steel
Killing in the hands of braves
Excalibur is living
Camelot are always here
The woods of Britain hear the druid call
Arthur Pendragon needs the Holy Graal
The magic parchment
Reveal for the wizard Merlin
Said that Camelot
Will fall down by your own blood
Sir Mordred the evil knight
Rides in the shadows with pain
Sir Mordred the evil knight
His misery is sad like the rain
In the mists of Avalon
The lady of the lake is dancing
Old knowledge are hiding
There are rituals of godness
Oh Oh Oh Oh
On the round table
Your brave knight are tired
But the search is over
and the kingdom remains strong
So the Mordred Armies
With hate and swords attack
In the edge of lake
Father and son die for the crown
King Arthur The Britain cry
Four fairy queens have taken your soul
King Arthur The Britain cry
The holy sings vanishes of this world
In the mists of Avalon
The lady of the lake is dancing
Old knowledge are hiding
There are rituals of godness
Oh Oh Oh Oh
The king rises again
From the Island of the Dragon
The king rises again
To help us in the dark ages of our Kingdom
I am a creature from the Underdark
Where no humans or dwarfs
In the dungeons get survive
Look to me and feel the fear
While you is take to die
I can hear your last words
In the caves said goodbye
We don't see
The light of the stars
Visions come in my mind
Evil Loth
The queen of Drows
Creeping for the dark
Listen the elf songs
Singing all your horror
Trought the underdark
A risk for everyone
A millions miles from home
Trought the underdark
You will know
Now hear my screams
Who I am I'm your end
Troubling your dreams
Dephts of Toril hateful laughters
Trolls watch in the walls
My mortal trap is wait for you
Down for the underground
They will come
In the winter night
Whith bright axes and your might
Stoling cities
For all the lands
The death in your hands
Listen the elf songs
Singing all your horror
Trought the underdark
A risk for everyone
A milions miles from home
Trought the underdark
Alone in the darkness
Walking on the Ice
Thinking in your mission
Waiting for the fight
Its comes face your fears
And afronting over the montains
Under the stars
Under the sun
All taverns of the kingdom
The bards sing storys of fight
Sir Lockdunam
The cold steel is your might
How can I feel thousand battles I saw
Strong like a storm listening the called of war
My spirit is a drum that conclamed the warriors
Death is redemption to goes to Valhalla
The sunrise in the westland
Following in your dreams
No rest for the Knights
Forgivening your sins
The battlefield is burning
For the mystical souls
With the bright armors
Braveries on your own
The time is getting over
And everething you hear
Are echos of the past
All that you see
Is the fire in the sky
The human race believe
The end is coming near
All turning to darkness
They are living in fear
For salvation you will die
Now is the time
To fight and survive
The time is not a desease
Waiting for something can salve your souls
Running to eternity
New millenium bring freedom
Freedom to the land
Bring us hope in the wings of rason
Take us faithfull hands
The people deep in trubles
Broken all the dreams
Make war for proud
So our civilization
Never win
We are not walking
To destruction of life
Is just the first step
For a great evolution
To the human kind
In this farway lands
The blood of my soldiers
Walking on the earth
Waiting for a great moment
Estorys of skills
About the Silver Squadron
Souls living in the forest
In your battlefield requiem
Agony and despair sufocate in the air
Storming over my head
Swords and axes ripping the flash
For who can wait the sunrise
tomorrow under the skies
For who can wait for the fight
It's your battlefield requiem
The wings of dragon
Draw in my arms
I grasp my blade
Forged in fire
One rason for fighting
A conquest for glory
The gods are blassing
With the wind and the power of steel
In north lands covered
By snow and brave
Where man cultivate the ground
His arms and shields hang up in their walls
Looking at cold sea
The wind sings a new conquest
Odim lord of Valhalla
Save all the clans over the horizons
I see the distant coast
And high rocks of my country
I may die but I'm strong
Good bye my brothers we must fight
Crossing every ocean and
Running trough the battlefield
Strong like hammer of Thor
Gods of Ice
Marching under grey sky
Master of thunder storm
We'll win the war because
We're Gods of Ice
No mercy for strangers
Invading and burning dales
Killing men children and women
Tears cannot stop the barbarian fire
Valkyrias take care for souls
Of our fighters
Dead for Viking honour
Let all of them living forever
Marching under grey sky
Master of thunder storm
We'll win the war because
We're Gods of Ice
I drink in the skull of my enemy
To celebrate our victory
For the proud of my brothers

I am not the enemy we are not the enemy

Ancient hate and sorrow
Painted black
Unleashed from the dark past
Unleashed for mankind
Hear
A voice from the deep dark night
Black as the eyes of fear
Black as the future of life
Dark is the sound of the end
From now on all happiness must die
Forever
Forever as the end
You have your eyes to see
The darkest season of humanity
Its just a matter of time
Seconds minutes hours no This is the end
AH
An eye wide open on everything
An eye to surrender
The future is Black
AH
Black as the deep dark night
Black as the eyes of fear
Black as the future of life
Run escape from your world
Made of realitys scars
Proud to be still alive
Traces of blood are falling
Hear The abyss is calling
Hear it well Its your name
Its time to pay your ticket
Its time to leave your life
They are coming
Wolves are still hungry
Corpses are still bleeding
Ripped and eaten by
the ravens of death and pain
When rain falls wolves gather
They find the light of day
They find the path to oblivion
Turning you from beast to prey
The voice is calling
The voice is howling
Hear it well its your name
Death is coming
Death is coming
Death is coming
Death is coming
Wolves are hungry
When rain falls wolves gather
They find the light of day
They find the path to oblivion
Turning you from beast to prey
Eating the flesh
And grinding it to the bone
Ripping out of the body the soul
The rage is coming forth
Wolves are still hungry
And corpses are bleeding too
No one is laughing out loud
But the smiling death
As the black rain flows away
As the night reclaims its preys
A black journey through desolation
Im immersed in a sea of shadows
The longest night enthroned
The longest pain Ive proved myself for
Riding the raging storm
Yeah I hate this fucking world
Hatred Hatred Hatred
To hope is to die
Night please blind my eyes
Future turns to grey
Welcome the sound of decay
It comes down like rain
It flows in rivers grey
Its colour is the end
A trap in a sea of sand
As warm blood on a sword
As fog covering the world
A voice from the dead
Yeah Im talking about
Hatred Hatred Hatred and Hatred again
Yeah I see now I know
Now I despise weakness seed
Now I see yeah I know
You are the cause of my disease
Come on come black tide
Flow in violence and painful ways
Show me your disgraced hands
Clean the filth out of this world
Come on come black tide
Get humanity exiled far from here
Take everything away with your dark waves
I want to be alone on this planet earth
Light without traces of hope its standing above
A black tunnel A maze of torment
Im going where all laments die aside your light
My world is almost dead as its purity
I am the truth you would never hear
Into the frozen dimension unto the eternal pain
Hatred for yourself Pain is so sweet
The world doesnt need you
The world wont wait for you
The world will show you obscenities
The world is just putrid scum
I was born to be an exception
A pillar of disgust and hatred
In the deepest chambers of my mind
What I am people cant understand
It keeps me warm on dark cold nights
Traces of blood are crawling behind
In the deepest chambers of my mind
where my ideas go blind
From my head to my spine
Cutting the throats of disease and singing
The last rhyme the last song so sweet
The last hymn to hail the beyond
Before drowning in a sea of blood
in a sea of blood
Fields of ruins
It looks like a desert
Winds stand silent
Hate breeds the earth
The world is in ruin
Cover of blood
Piles of bones
Rivers of skulls
The ground is now full
of deep red scars
The world is in ruin
Cover of blood
Blood red torment
Blood red storm
Blood red coloured I was born
The world is in ruin
The world is in ruin
The world is in ruin
I march upon its death
Who called it home
Had to find a new one
The world is in ruin
No hope this feeble time
A march upon the shadows
A march upon thy night
The world is in ruin
Palaces stand aflame
Mirrors are broken
Now the ground has my sign
The sign of Satan
I am ready to be blind
Blind to the world Ive seen That I dislike
Living filtering
The underworld
All your joyous emotions
Cast in the coldest stone
Nothing I feel nothing I await
I have nothing positive to say
Endless reactions so endless pain
Death shall hit its target again
Living filtering
The underworld
All your joyous emotions
Cast in the coldest stone
Trying to make more time
Present is unknown
Cut your flesh and spill your soul
This is your last dawn
Tormented  By an ancient plan of gaining space
waiting for the storm
Its time to put an end
To love and happiness
Present is so cruel
A retribution of madness
Marching on the storm
Going ahead without piety
Freedom is hunting me
In this blackest cloudy sky
Leave your mortal life behind
Possessed  By torments of past memories
Devoured  By an hunger of centuries ago
Explosion  Is the sound of chains broken
Infection  Is the living hate through my veins
I am what you cant control
I am fire in its purest form
I am built with the sound of anger
I am what you cant complain
I am water blue and drained
I am built with the spine of horror
waiting for the storm
Disease in spiral downwards
What I felt in that moment in time
Marching upon an altar made of flesh and bones
An abyss of fury instead an age of reason
Im getting my freedom back paying with your sun
Do you hear steps at the door
Do you reckon the smell of
It's lifethe the dark that binds you
Frightened by your own smell
Bitterness will run you through
Silent screaming
Turning twisting the alphabet
Frantic eyes
Awaiting the answer
Splinters of a poem
Fragments of what you used to be
Habitual and gullible
Rundown memoirs is all that's left
Do you wish to sleep
Do you aim for the shadow
Do you feel infected
It's lifethe the dark that binds you
It's the cowardice that pulls you under
And takes you to the end where it begins
Release the world is waiting on your arrival
Do you know about atrocity
Do you that everybody's gone
Do you know that you're on your own
It's lifethe the dark that binds you
I demand nothing but I want it all
what privilege do we have under the sun
that gives us the right to the throne
will forever wander alone through the years
but I won't let you near
begging for you to understand
the fear that lives in my soul
which is an untouched spring
read what is written on the silent mouth
what is written in the soul
for which is written in the shining silence
we all have to read
my body will be bent from the burdens
when the shaking floor of lifeforce
reveal its chasm underneath
if only one could be two steps ahead
I often dream of huge numb buildings
jetblack sinister architecture
being installed when nobody sees
Their appearance so sudden
that few would take notice
And when I wake up
I imagine being crushed by one
imagining it's weight it's silence
and the absence of excuses for a havoced life
and the privilege of a 22kilometer tombstone
Jotun
A body of black
that carried no reflection
defying it's own room
unearthly eggs of decreation
There would be colonies
mushroomscattered forever out of context
rising spores from a dying world
to pollute to chase away what's left
Sunwhite pulverised desert stone
and serpentine lizard mouths
Pales away the pyramids
rewriting 4500 years of history
raping the statue of liberty
outplays the acropolis
inverting the fjords
invades the NY skyline to
Jotun
Can we identify them
as the flint buried in our reptile skulls
or the timebomb coded in our DNA
Shame marries the guilt
introduces itself to the
concept of total loneliness
Sensations repressed
make friends with
Suicidia and
here the leeches begin to
suck away the lust for life
Thus
Escape takes lead
into a world unknown uncontrolled by all
where border are erased and potential infinite
Chosen cells glands and transmitters
blast the body with joy
Astral feet running
up to dimension covered with gold
stairs of glowing ectoplasma
safir onyx and buzzing vibrations
A dead man banquet
food for the gods
There's only 1 real world
our earth is but a shadow
Created from a child's heart a living jewel
from now on abode for a soul in its setting
Now
sutting the bloodline
retie the bleeding roots
to a heavenly ship of glass
and let it drift in passive arrogance
in a oneword dialogue with the stars
Tried of dull ages I walk the same ground
Collecting the tragedies still
Hollow ambitions in a hollow mind
Carried my cross to the hill
And how I lust for the dance and the fire
Ceep of the nectarine sunset to drink
Spill me the wind and its fire
To steal of the colors
Shattered hope became my guide
And grief and pain my friends
A brother pact in a bloodink penned
Declare my silent end
Naked an dying under worlds of silent stone
Naked and dying under worlds of silent stone
And how I lust for the dance and the fire
deep of the nectarine sunset to drink
spill me the wind and its fire
to steal of the colors
I am I am
I'm the moonshield
Your self control makes me feel alone
I've tried confidence had it for breakfast today
I've lost the perfection a mess without words
The image I project  me without me
The picture that I scanned is borrowed
Slowly all that I believed in turning into a lie
To aim and miss my supernatural art
Spending to much time with myself
Trying to explaining who I am
How come it's possible
I wish there was a way
Suddenly I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay
I need someone to break the silence
before it all falls apart
I need something to cling onto
before I break you in parts
So afraid of what you may think
And all the plastic people that surrounds me
I have to find the path to where it all begins
To teach the world my supernatural art
As we build a brand new planet
Let's reconstruct and get it straight
Unlock forgotten skills
Travel to a new dimension
Solace from the dark seduction
Take heed we are the new invention
We're the settlers of year zero
Let's reconstruct and take it back
Leaders of our time
Heading for a downfall
The threshold of revolution
Take heed the last freedom call
Blanked out fire etched on the crystal display
The sees are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb
Collect the word add some gold and give it back
The sees are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb
From a thousand branches
Spreading the new voice
As we're heading for the throne
Connect evolution will begin
Call me by my astral name
Breeding fear through wordless tongue
Heavenly thirst  unspeakable pain
Emptied from all human motion
Confront the faceless wrath
Beckoning silent from a sphere behind space
Through twisted ruins of uncompleted dreams
Sights of towers reaching for the moon
Clawing at the skies  they gonna pull it down
Beyond all galaxies
through timeless eaons of frost
Unearthly hunger  angels descent
We are entering dimensions behind space 
Beyond all galaxies
through timeless eaons of frost
I can't tolerate your sadness
cause it's me you're drowning
I won't allow any happiness
cause everytime you laugh I feel so guilty
I blame the needs that you feed
cause selfish eyes would not see
Am I forced to have any regret
I've become the lie beautiful and free
In my righteous own mind
I adore and preach the insanity you gave
Sell me the infection it's only for the weak
No need for sympathy the misery that is me
No need for sympathy it's only for the weak
On bleeding knees I accept my fate
I've lost the ability to paint the clouds
cause it's me you're draining
I'm stuck in this slowmotion dark day
cause everytime you run I fall behind
Far away is a place where I hide
the truth that have to be locked away
And so I hear my voice again
The tale of the bitter man here I am
Shake the silence and hear what it says
The tranquil pride that become the lie
Geology is digging through
my brain
a manta engulfing the world
to throw it up once again
to a guild of a lifted dagger
Neowolf but older again
than the Lupus itself
linked its fur to the gyroscope of time
a collection of failures
A diabolical sequences of stabs
written in cunning stone
from the fossilised of thieves
our lives dies
I see the nursing allmother
spitting out a trail of termites
in the mouth of her firstborn hope
breast ripe with smogfilled rebellion
Apathy dressed in violence
white insectoid legs
curse her lips and mouth
receptive only to pain
I parish and nobody will know
as my mouth remains still
my heart awaits me filled with gravel
as the pain grows with each touch
since I marked her out from my tower
reality focused through forbidden lenses
she owns enough of preciousness
a penalty given by the source
but I still have no choice through
the hinderens frighten
a labyrinth closing at the edge of space
but they never allow
she's shut for all beings but one
I give I scorn I threat
egoism dictates human relations
a world where fashion outshines morality
here success is written in bloodred colours
designed by the thirst for power
gather the faithful and propose a toast
to the epoch of indifference
an all to ordinary story
with aftertaste so bitter
forced to be someone I don't want to be
I'm losing myself sinking deeper down
I'm caught in the world wound web
a time represented by the void
an excuse without content
stuck in the abyss of existence
with a content void of excuse
an all to ordinary story
this is my story
with an aftertaste so bitter
sinking deeper down
I'm caught  I'm cage
I'm gone
As I aim for that bright white day
Conflict serum is my aura
It seems that life's so fragile
I guess I'll fly some other time
I lack from superhighway thoughts
Won't live as long as the city lights
Soaked by underwater times
Electric splash on a midnight drive
Wish I could rape the day
just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely
Guided by the pinball map
The driver still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify
Before we injected this common pride
Sometimes I don't belong
Release me from your world
Pacified by the small things in life
I wait for earthquakes to rearrange
Never been able to use the force
I only have it read to me
Despite all the misguided faith
Maybe I'll find a place in this mess
Early morning moments
A glimpse of joy
But soon it's over and I return to dust
As I try to be
Everything and everyone
I waste away
in your world the day is no threat
in my world there is an absence of light
genetic superior cell controlled
by the fathomless and unbearable
a radical new Form of plastic and rage
biologically optimized
but with a strangling pulse
in your world you find me worthy
in my world I parashoot my life
a virtual drugstore populated
by the fathomless and unbearable
machine meat and blood
in an intimate relationship
the new  superior 
more effective than all the preceding
when we can no longer
cry and reality is torn
then it's easy to forget
that the responsibility lies on us all
in your world the night is no threat
in my world the darkness
transforms to a vision of hell
populated by fathomless and unbearable
Welcome here the squirrelwheel begins
fasten the left hand belts
Remember not to think too much
and your trip will be numbingly pleasant
Noncaring is the easiest way
but to secure a passage to the 2nd plane
you have to complete level one
Their deadsmile lips turn on their TV
while urban gravestones scrape the skies
This is episode 666
destination chaos
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself
War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end little he can do alone
You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give
Caress the one
The neverfading rain in your heart
The tears of snowwhite sorrow
Caress the one the hiding Amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time
We reach for the ones whoever dare
You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give
Caress the one
The neverfading rain in your heart
The tears of snowwhite sorrow
Caress the one the hiding Amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Reaching searching for something untouched
Hearing voices of the neverfading calling
Caress the one
The neverfading rain in your heart
The tears of snowwhite sorrow
Caress the one the hiding Amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Baptised with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself
War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end little he can do alone
You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give
Reach
For handheld heart through life
For the dancer to arrive
Reach
And catch me before I fall
Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time we reach
For the ones whoever dare
You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give
Reach
For handheld heart through life
For the dancer to arrive
Reach
And catch me before I fall
Reach
For a friend whoever cares
For someone whoever dares
Reach
To catch me when I fall
Reaching for the doubting one by heart
Hearing voices calling
Catch the one who's falling
Reach
For handheld heart through life
For the dancer to arrive
Reach
And catch me before I fall
Reach
For a friend whoever cares
For someone whoever dares
Reach
To catch me when I fall
Sweet little words made for silence
Not talk
Young heart for love
Not heartache
Dark hair for catching the wind
Not to veil the sight of a cold world
Kiss while your lips are still red
While he`s still silent
Rest while bosom is still untouched unveiled
Drown into eyes while they`re still blind
First day of love never comes back
A passionate hour`s never a wasted one
The violin the poet`s hand
Every thawing heart plays your theme with care
Kiss while your lips are still red
While he`s still silent
Rest while bosom is still untouched unveiled
Drown into eyes while they`re still blind
630 winter morn
Snow keeps falling silent dawn
A rose by any other name
Eva leaves her Swanbrook home
A kindest heart which always made
Me ashamed of my own
She walks alone but not without her name
Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field
Mocked by man to depths of shame
Little girl with life ahead
For a memory of one kind word
She would stay among the beasts
Time for one more daring dream
Before her escape edenbeam
We kill with her own loving heart
Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field
You smile without a meaning
How's the smile with a fist in your mouth
What's love without a feeling
Something i never will know
Burn me in a fire
Just to see if i feel
Try to hang me higher
To see what i mean
See if i feel
Find me
I can't fight back
Even though im trying to find my way home
This is the shame i call myself
Looking in the mirror
The cracks just appears
This life got no reason
To walk this thing we call world
Just give me a reason
Just like a stone
Come and bring me home
See if i feel
Find me
I can't fight back
Even though im trying to find my way home
This is the shame i call myself
I can't fight back
It's just one ticket away
When i look around and all i see is misery
I can't always be the one you want me to be
I am fading further far from reality
Something is missing and can not be found
The link between us is falling apart
So i close my eyes and now you're gone
the random hero lives on
Something is missing and can not be found
The link between us is falling apart
I'm fading away im fading away
I never thought I'd see this day
I never thought I'd feel this way
I never wanna feel this way
You were all i ever needed
I can't take the pain
I don't wanna feel this pain
Something is missing and can not be found
The link between us is falling apart
So i close my eyes and now you're gone
the random hero lives on
Something is missing and can not be found
The link between us is falling apart
I'm fading away im fading away
I've searched and never found a way
Follow the visions and let me decay
I'm so sick and tired of this
It's time for me to find a way out
Out of this purgatory
If this came to and end
I'll make this better
But you gave me no reason
And now you face the floor
I'll call it vengance
A thing i never knew existed
Oh no you burn all the bridges behind you
You better fly away to your paradise again
It's the only place you know
Where death is most alive
I can't get you out of my head
Some stories is all i have left
Your picture slowly burns
Burns away from my heart
Have you ever looked into their eyes
And said a little prayer
Have you ever looked into their hearts
And wished that you were there
Have You ever loved someone
And always known that they don't fucking care
Oh no you burn all the bridges behind you
You better fly away to your paradise again
It's the only place you know
Where death is most alive
I've faced the fact and none will bring me down
none can ever take me down
If you only knew how good this feels
I thought that this was the point of no return
But you were a fake a fucking joke
none can bring me down
You are a fake
just a fucking fake
You've been standing in every corner
Is this how you feel alive
It's like the times when you were a kid
A travesty you've long forgotten
Now you walk the streets like a ghost
Earn the money that you can keep
You're just a fucking whore
And guess i know why girl you got no confidence
girl you got no confidence
But what can bring you down so low
Girl whats inside of your mind
You better start to listen
You can not live like this
I hope your mother is proud
You spred legs for a dollar
And guess i know why girl you got no confidence
girl you got no confidence
But what can bring you down so low
Girl whats inside of your mind
You are forever lost
And girl you tried so hard
And now you have seen the stars
They can't bring you back
And guess i know why girl you got no confidence
girl you got no confidence
But what can bring you down so low
Girl whats inside of your mind
You are forever lost
And girl you tried so hard
Now you've seen the stars
They can't bring you back
If i just could smile for just one more time
Would i be a better person
If i did things right and make them write
Would i be a better friend
No you'll be alone forever
My vision fades and its all black and white
Through all this nightmare bring me back to life
OH MY GOD
What the fuck is wrong with me
I just make everything worse
OH MY GOD
Another bit of emptiness
There is no escape from this living hell
Something i must live with every day
And now the scars are deeper why
But none seems to care
This is something i must live with everyday
You found me half hanging
You found me all to soon
You turned your back and walked away
OH MY GOD
What the fuck is wrong with me
There is no escape from this living hell
Something i must live with every day
And now the scars are deeper why
But none seems to care
This is something i must live with everyday
Never try to run me over
I'm comming back with twice as much
I will hunt you down to the end of world
There your road will end
Become alive I'll detach your soul
Now put to rest your final breath
This anger just builds up
Don't try to hide
Make your final bow
Don't fuck with me
There's nothing that can stop me
You better run for your life
You better start to fucking run you motherfucker
Would be a fucking dream come true
Enough shit said you're done
Become alive I'll detach your soul
Now put to rest your final breath
This anger just builds up
Don't try to hide
Make your final bow
Don't fuck with me
Never try to run me over
I'm comming back with twice as much
I will hunt you down to the end of world
There your road will end
Become alive I'll detach your soul
Now put to rest your final breath
This anger just builds up
Don't try to hide
Make your final bow
Don't fuck with me
There's nothing that can stop me
You better run for your life
You better start to fucking run you motherfucker
Realize what you've done
You better walk the line
Pathetic and divine
As you trying to breathe
Can you see the anger running through my blood
You face the world in another direction
Don't come closer
None will remember your name
When you're dead you're out of the game
This is what you left behind
These paper wings can't make you fly
Succumb to release its your final demise
Can you see the anger running through my blood
You face the world in another direction
Don't come closer
None will remember your name
When you're dead you're out of the game
I wish i could be there once again
As we growing strong
None will remember your name
When you're dead you're out of the fucking game
You face the world in another direction
Don't come closer
None will remember your name
When you're dead you're out of the game
I wish i could be there once again
As we growing strong
None will remember your name
When you're dead you're out of the fucking game
When you just walked in i put my legs on the run
I never looked back i was kinda weak
I hope some day that things will change
It feels like i slowly die
So wipe your eyes
Before you drown in a pool of filth and disgrace
There was nothing i could do
To erase this pain i feel
Have i found a reason not to lie
We all got demons that lies in our bed
Don't look behind just keep on moving
Because those things will never die
You can just hold on we got to move on
Because those things will never die
What do you want from me
I'm just a loser
Don't look behind just keep on moving
Because those things will never die
You can just hold on we got to move on
Because those things will never die
What do you want from me
I'm just a loser
You smile without a meaning
How's the smile with a fist in your mouth

You can just hold on we got to move on
Because those things will never die
What do you want from me
Set in the quiet a cause and effect
Dragged down weight you always want more
You are the problem
Losing control urges are rising
I won't remember anything
I would not feel anything
Suffer as I have
You always want more lost in the fire
Match No match you set it yourself
Dragged down youth
Now you overbreed with curses and killers
You are the problem
Losing control we must remove them
I won't remember anything
I would not feel anything
Nobody took away anything
That was you
Knowing so little and living so glib
You are the problem
Now suffer as I have
You're only living once
What don't you understand
Can't change the world in a day
Mortal fears fan the flames
Unconscious energy
Is all you may ever be
Can't change the world in a day
So they choose to throw it all away
My only crime in your eyes
Trade deception exchange for pride
Praise bigotry on all who sleep but never I
They want you fucking dead
What don't you understand
Can't change the world in a day
All belief is just a game
I want you fucking dead
What don't I understand
Can't change the world in a day
But I'll try to do it anyway
My only crime in your eyes
Trade deception exchange for pride
Praise treachery on the weak but never I
I'm a legion on my own
No one needs me no one knows
Can't change the world in a day
I don't like it here anyway
I can integrate but only to a limit
Overpopulate not enough to go around
Just play along and you'll succeed
Just pay your dues
They're fucking lying to you
I am not the best but few are ahead of me
Sometimes I'm in check
Other times an egotist
Make trade make cash
Fit in at last just to distract
Just play the song and you'll succeed
Just pay your dues
You're fucking full of shit
I don't need to integrate
I hate the facts I hate the game
I hate belief I hate your faith
I hate your face I'm gone
I fake my soul
I don't mean to hate
I guess it comes naturally
Make trade make cash
Fit in at last just to distract
Just pick a side and you'll succeed
Just pay your dues
Fuck you
Winded and failing on a standard of life
Beckoning rivals for war on another day
All of the angels will crumble and see
They are the demons defending tragedy
We are alone covered in dirt
Begging for reason logic and might
Picking a faith as a plea for reward
Deeper inside you know that it doesn't work
Follow equations of matter and space
Trust not a witness trust what is verified
We are alone covered in dirt
Bearing our anger wisdom and dare
Share what you know
This is what I believe in
And it takes no believing
It's a science and changing
While the meek are denying
With the wealth that is flaunted
We could cure all the haunted
Yet the faithful are lying
To preserve all the fear
Placing all my bets on vivid dreams
Romancing collapsing
Even if all dies here I have my place
Surrounding withdrawing
Lay blame on intentions or call it on fate
I'm looking around but never the right way
I want to return to a place of purity
But I hope that I am welcome
Who am I to say I love waiting
Naively privately
Real yet surreal my own to feel
Transgressing regressing
And life is sort of twisted that way
I'm looking to preserve an era called home
All feasible doubts unwelcome
We're passing the time and trying to keep sane
A matter of perspective and all views change
I want to return to a place I called home
But I hope that I am welcome
One bleeding all the others follow
Clueless in the hollow
Too aware stepping out of line
Forget the claim of crime
Drink poison slowly through your eyes
Just as they've designed
Those awake maybe know the answer
Never care to tell
Lights perfect times out of time
Rage taking me out of mind
Only I can finish this
It's all burning down at your hand
You chose giving in
Overwhelmed insane
Damning venture in blood
Destroy just to create
Your choice ever clear be it rare
Disown all of which makes you care in vein
Damning venture in blood
Create to be alive
A venture in blood
I am all I create
None of my answers
Satisfy questions
Everyone's theories
Never could speak for me
Paradoxes never ending
And I'm dead that's my name
Pain that's my name
Since the beginning
Shattering slowly
Burning all bridges
Maybe you're better off
To forget me
Keep what I've done
And I'm gone
Hard to find
Free again all at once
Anywhere is the same
Time all at once
But hope hard to find
Why
If you want educate alternatives
If you want we can kill them collect
Make a sound you have tipped off everyone
Look around now they're waging a war
If you want we can take down popular
If you want we can blind them with facts
Make it sound too loud they will shut you out
Look around at their ignorance
If you want educate alternatives
If you want maybe they'll open their eyes
Make a sound I gave up on reasoning
Look around I gave up on hope
If you want take the torch and carry on
If you want take and bury the worth
Make it sound I am leaving everything
Look around I am killing me
Allegorize all I know whatever it be
The modern obsolete
Value is contrived
If you want educate alternatives
If you want maybe they'll open their eyes
Make it sound I gave up on reasoning
Cause IÃÂ´m tired being pushed by you
I know what I can be look out
IÃÂ´m hard headed IÃÂ´m about to blow
IÃÂ´m gonna show you what I wanna do
And I know what I can be
Let me tell you how I feel 
IÃÂ´m Alright
IÃÂ´m alive
For the first time in my life 
I was born with a broken heart
So I can tell you what itÃÂ´s all about
But I know what I can be look out
Tomorrow thatÃÂ´s another day
Take my hand donÃÂ´t you be afraid
Cause I know what I can be
Let me tell you how I feel 
IÃÂ´m Alright 
Cry cry wonÃÂ´t help you know
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Look out baby IÃÂ´m a powerhouse
You can have a piece of me
Cause no one knows what I can be 
IÃÂ´m Alright
She said that I am all that she needs
But donÃÂ´t try live your life through me
Now sheÃÂ´s down on her knees begging please
Together forever
Together whatever
She said that IÃÂ´ve got a heart of stone
Hey girl why donÃÂ´t you leave me alone
Sometimes I wish I never been born
Together forever
There is a demon within us all
Stay confront the hate inside you erase it
I have seen much better days
But hope still flows within my veins
I still have faith my mind can change
And drop these thoughts that plague my gaze
Have you learned to test your mind
False perception can make us blind
Dont let the evil control your sight
We are all in this together
Though our symptoms are not the same
It is not permanent see less
What is the purpose of hatred
In those whose walk at offbeat paces
This stone cold heart of snow
You pride yourself on alone
If brings out misery
Only if time would pass you up
To make the meaning antique
We'd live so mirthfully
You would forsake those who show no harm
And abnegate their thoughts
The pain you seek in us
It is the pain you secrete
Live with passion
And evict your convictions
It is still clear
That you can cure yourself through reevaluation
Rise
Our world is moving forward
Close your eyes and it will leave you behind
End the obsession
And cleanse the selfish oppression
We aren't of the faint of heart
Hardened that cannot endure a sin
Live with passion
And evict your convictions
It is still clear
That you can cure yourself through reevaluation
Call me god
If you believe in the faulty
This is the worship of mavericks
It is the bane of our desires
And its been going for too long
For there are greater ideals
Its so pathetic how youve been living
Through the visions of someone else
The pedestal its placed above the sky
Do you wish that you were granted this
A life composed of inscience
You seek the elation
The fix of novelty at your demand
I want to break
right through this worthless investment
You seem to deem as something real
I see youre infatuated
Synthetic deities will not fool me
So realize the path youve chosen to take
The sea of contingency was right before my sight
I need to realize that Im adept
Its through acknowledging our capability
And brace the waves of society
You will meet thousands of wandering souls
But who will you let define you
To perpetuate the growth of camaraderie
Ive seen your eyes they gleam with antipathy
Ill risk my chance on someone else
Dont make haste to satisfy your current state
From the virtues you hold on to
Genetic drift
the chance of influence
its in my blood
I know I'm prone to react this way
I knew our thoughts and they could not relate
Provide the clarity I need to hold stability
I think Im torn between the space
We have come too far to break this down
Is this the way that well end this
That makes us pray for you
Its over twenty years youve lived in fear
A symbol of hope to everyone
So hang in there please the worst will not come
and so I will not hold my breath
The wind is still blowing
Amongst the hills of this foreign place
Sharing our hearts illuminating our states
And though this flight wont last forever
I know its one I wont soon forget
Stay and bring your life to this circle
The stories endearing were high off the harmony
This feels like home but is it where I belong
My mind cant decide
So pour the liquid of reason so we can surmise
A bluesky design and leave the past behind us
Look at this gathering
We are the products of leniency
Tonight we are one
Entranced by the greater surroundings
Our spirits rekindled by a central flame
There is no feeling thats quite like this
This is the last time well share this space
Tonight we are one
It starts with conversation
Disconnected and its just the beginning
To know that pressure builds when
Were the victims of selfdoubt
I cant seem to break down the barricade
Ill stay to maintain whats left of this
Dont want to burn down these bridges tonight
Ill run the risk of failing again
The darkness has risen and taken my vision
To places I cant describe
Youve used to define me
point of view
but its mine and I stand by what is on my mind
couldnt care if you smite my
judgement
I smile in prize fight
so far Ive been living to please
decrease tension
now Im just thinking of me
I wanna venture
step to the deep end forever
sail ships of relations into great weather
simmer down
you bitter clown
I see that frown
and body language that matches
unlatch your heart and just relax it
At your command and its lacking an exit
With every step there is a sense of security
I was wrong and I cant believe
That its taken me this long
To recognize adversity within me
I have tried to extinguish these demons
What does it take to see the silver lining
Yet Im the critic without direction
Its time to let this go
Ive stricken down your words
With nothing more then a baseless perspective
And Im cheating my own mind into believing
Your thoughts are worthless
You dont deserve this
I thought Id be your voice of reason
To guide you to a better place
But I cannot dictate your direction
This has killed my way of interconnection
And its leaving me in a strain of remorse
That I just can't shake and decide to relegate
I know I need to ease the blame
Take a look inside
There wasnt anything that seemed amiss in me
I would just dismiss the force that I portrayed
It was the frailty I couldnt see in me
And I was wrong
It was the frailty I couldnt see in me
Its only silence that youll be getting from me
These lines are broken and lack utility
Who knew wed grow so far apart
From sheathed hostility
Seem so far away
There is no value in playing games with me
Respect is gone the bond undone
Distance read as giving up on our amity
A change thats made through reformation
So if we meet again and if the air is cleared
so take it all back now
gonna take this back my one thing
it's coming do you want to fuel my one thing god
down cause its gonna be my thing take this back
me
this back

White cold sea
In the far far north
There's no thrills
Just wind and pain
Come with me
Unholy Divine
Stay with me
Unholy Divine
And take me there
Cry with me
Unholy Divine
Laugh with me
Unholy Divine
And take me there
And kiss me hard
And close my eyes
And say good night child
Red cold sea
In the far far north
Theres no thrills
Just wind and pain
Little fifteen
You help her forget
The world outside
You're not part of it yet
And if you could drive
You could drive her away
To a happier place
To a happier day
That exists in your mind
And in your smile
She could escape there
Just for a while
Little fifteen
Little fifteen
Why take the smooth with the rough
When things run smooth
Its already more than enough
She knows your mind
Is not yet in league
With the rest of the world
And it's little intrigues
Do you understand
Do you know what she means
As time goes by
And when you've seen what she's seen
You will
Little fifteen
Little fifteen
You help her forget
The world outside
You're not part of it yet
And if you could drive
You could drive her away
To a happier place
To a happier day
That exists in your mind
And in your smile
She could escape there
Just for a while
Little fifteen
Little fifteen
Why does she have to defend
Her feelings inside
Why pretend
She's not had a life
A life of near misses
Now all that she wants
Is three little wishes
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while
Little fifteen
Crime
Always mine
Always there
Crime is the servant of time
Always mine
Always there
The end of secrets
Is still a lost dream
The tale of wiseman
Smells like a dead lustful old corpse
But you believe and pray
There is no chance to get away up high
Dark nights and mornings
Still strong our faith will die
Dark nights and mornings
So hard to speak without lying
Now all children are free
All churches are burning in the name of truth
The final calling
The light I see in the end
The final calling
It's only a dream it's nothing else
Crime
Always mine
Always there
Meine Damen und Herren
Wir haben Elefanten
Wir haben Affen
Wir haben alles
So silent
I came into your room
So silent
I unsheathed my knife
So silent
I came into your room
So silent
I unsheathed my knife
So silent 
When the dark wood fell before me
And all the paths were overgrown
When the priest of pride
Says there is no other way
there is no other way 
So silent
I came into your room
So silent
I unsheathed my knife
So silent
I came into your room
So silent
When the dark wood fell before me
And all the paths were overgrown
When the priest of pride
Says there is no other way
So silent 
I came into your room
So silent
When the dark wood fell before me
And all the paths were overgrown
When the priest of pride
Says there is no other way
Die in fire
I don't want to listen to your lies
Die and suffer
Delightful to my ear
My hammer looking for the giants
My hammer waiting for the giants
Angry thunder in his free cold eye
Goats are running through the skies
All these Midgard creatures want to survive
Begging for another day
For one night
Die in water
Dark stinking as your mind
In deep underground
Die like worms you slut
My hammer looking for the giants
My hammer waiting for 
Angry thunder in his free cold eye
Goats are running through the skies
All these Midgard creatures want to survive
Begging for another day
For one night
Close to your soul
In pure light
Delicate like wine
From these hills
Red finger tips
Red water
Spinning down and deep
To unknown
To cold dark sleep
It's all you need
The way of your dance is
So quiet
Bleeding forever
Your wings of fire
Another desire
It's all you need
Never cry
Never ever inside
I feel this endless night
Never cry
Never ever inside
Never cry
Never ever inside
I feel this endless night
Never cry
Never ever inside
You poisoned a holy heart
You raped an innocent mind
And opened a sealed estate
Your arsenic instead of my blood
Brought the bitterness in
My quiet world
You offered illusions
In a cute package of words
You made me thirsty of what I despise
I was bandit and banit
Because of you false
You poisoned a holy heart
You raped an innocent mind
And opened a sealed estate
Your arsenic instead of my blood
Brought the bitterness in
My quiet world
Come on
Zealousy
Yield the relief to my craving body
Zone of nothing zone of fire
I wished to overcome you
But I became a victim
Of your unconscious conspiracy
You offered illusions
In a cute package of words
You made me thirsty of what I despise
I was bandit and banit
Because of you false
And I was suffering so hard
But my suffering is a proof of my higher rank
Thus finally I won
This was that he told to himself
Approaching to the foot of hill
Where was entrance to deep damp cave
And shelter for the Talisman
With knowledge gained from Shamballa
Will you deliver seven stones
To places marked on this map
By your own will not by debt
From first steps I was encountered by breeze
Some more walk and last of stones will be placed
On stalactites crown where he never be seized
But my thoughts is now about cooper sheets
Which were brought by Delphi priest
Diagrams cast me into mist
Seven stones hidden under the canopy
Seven places with hidden supremacy
Not allowed to shine simultaneously
Each await for his time of the legacy
Related with bodies of celestial
Located at places perennial
Called to be shields from enemy
In time to wake up from vanity
 But I dont
 I dont want to hear a word
Because of you Im here See
 What can I
 I dont want anything
 So its my fault and Im to blame
What else to expect from you
 At least tell me Oh why we are here
 Something that I
 Say it O finally say it I'm begging you
 had in dream
 Tell me what it was and was I'm a part of it
 Took possession
 What do you mean you had a bad dream
 on my feel
 So this is a scandal from silliest dream
 How can you blame me for this
 Why are we on Wawel hill
Now she's in cave and lying unconscious
Fell thru the hole on the top of Wawel
The Troll Castle
At its end the great shadow delights human eye
With drawbridge over moat the towers blazes tall
In the troll castle
Troll castle dwelling of tale winds
Troll castle
Troll castle
The shadows' rune chanting from this crowd
They turn your vision's images also your words
In the troll castle
Troll castle dwelling of tale winds
Troll castle
Troll castle
In lichen covered brances on pines and spruces
And moss wreathes the root of the stem
Where dwarf birches blaze in the autumnal glow
Fallen leafs dance in the wind
In joyful ornament
Of the time of four powers
Where the flat rock lies runed
Of skalds greatest is the north wind
and never is it scorned
A kingly fulfilment
crystalline ice desert along its shore
The blood freezes for it slays
The cold loosens its snare around lake and slope
The bitter wolf weather is gone
Around creeks the water smoke vÃÂÃÂ¤per5
In joyful ornament
Of the time of four powers
Where the flat rock lies runed
Of skalds greatest is the north wind
And never is it scorned
A kingly fulfilment
For these may not be mentioned by name
Then the agony pendulum starts its eternal going
And he took these in his arms
Lulled by inebriation in whirling leaps
Broken lives with men like him
Girls in groups with blackened hands
Knights in shining shattered limbs
The time has come for you to lose
All you fought for a living soul
The time has come for you to lose
All you fought for
All you ever never had
Flicker the flames burn your hands
You know he'll take you down with him
Flicker the flames burn your hands
The Wiccaman he'll trade with you
Girls in black with blackened hearts
Knights in shining rested armor
Flicker the flames burn your hands
You know he'll take you down with him
Flicker the flames burn your hands
The Wiccaman he'll trade with you
Times that change the wind that blows
The realms of beasts are given souls
The girls in groups with blackened hearts
The shapes of Angels their noble hearts
Flicker the flames burn your hands
You know he'll take you down with him
Flicker the flames burn your hands
The Wiccaman he'll trade with you
The voices take me up
And snakes come twist about
Tell me what this knife is for
And tell me how to cut them out
The voices give me love
And the voices sell me dear
But show me how to smash them up
And show me how to leave them here
And the darkness sings to me
And the poison bleeds me dry
Darkness just throw it away
Darkness six feet below just isn't a fix
The poison don't come cheap
And the voices don't come slow
But I can see a shot inside
And power rising six feet below
Some god give me strength to disbelieve
These voices and the things they preach
Some God give me strength to disbelieve
These voices bring the death of me
Darkness just throw it away
Darkness six feet below just isn't a fix
The voices take me up
And snakes come twist about
Tell me what this knife is for
And tell me how to cut them out
The voices give me love
And the voices sell me dear
But show me how to smash them up
And show me how to leave them here
Some god give me strength to disbelieve
These voices and the things they preach
Some God give me strength to disbelieve
These voices bring the death of me
And the voices sing to me
And the voices bleed me dry
Darkness just throw it away
Darkness six feet below just isn't a fix
Dark angel give me life
Dark angel take us high
Give me heaven give me gold
Take the living take the old
Take the knife break the bone
Feel the blade and feel the stone
Dark angel a cold come through to us
And they will come
And they will dream
And they still live
To take this heaven and a cut of mine
Dark angel cut the skin
Love the red delight
Kneel at the moonsign
Bless this gift for you
Cry at the moonsign and bless this gift for you
Seventeen sounds break the chains
three wheels three worlds
Dark angel in the light of your eyes
Dark angel in the light of the moon
Dark angel in the light of the punishment
Dark angel can you believe
Kneeling down to yellow flowers
Plastic tubes and sun
The wine was bitter
we drank and grieved I cut your spitting tongue
Day gone dark
a shining sea
Let's torch this sky and bleeding city
But you're falling away
But she don't see the angels coming down
Spinning all their way down under sand
She don't see the lips all spitting sky
She don't love
The kiss was sweet Sharp and cold
Spitting like a child
But your falling And she's falling
Its hard to hear your voice again
Havent heard you for a while
Its hard to see your face again
Havent seen it for a while
All your things are spinning round
All your things are spinning now
Down by the trees where the rain comes falling
Is how her body hides
Down in the shade where the young girls crying
Is where here body lies
Down by the trees where the rain comes falling
Is how her body hides
Down in the shade where the young girls crying
Is where here body lies
Down by the trees where the rain comes falling
Is how her body hides
Down in the shade where the young girls crying
Is where here body lies
Down by the trees where the rain comes falling
Is how her body hides
Spin

In the hollow smiles of men that dance
The wheels of might in wasted miles
The light shines bright for you

The corn grows tall in hallowed fields
The flames burn high
The bodies yield

Your soul transcends what once was real
Keep me halo Keep me deep down Halo

In the hollow smiles Of men that dance

Keep me deep down Halo
She stands on the water on the lake of souls
The woman dressed in black
She stands with her hair in the storm
And her arms raised to the sky
She wakes on the water on the lake in the forest
The Devil and the woman in one
She siren stares
and siren sings
And she's calling
And the moon was shining
And I looked to her for the things she knew
And she was calling
Come to me
She said
It's time to face your master
give me your soul
She painted heaven a picture red and black
Her sweetness and for all our hearts
And she's calling
She gave me revelations
Delivered me
Waves drew back and this ship came crashing in
And she's calling
Always I'm split in billions
Always I hide
If you were young
But never believe me
Form almost anything I've worked it out
But I don't
You would forgive me If you could understand
But I love and I love and I love
She took my hand
Pulled me down to fall to where the air was ice
Vampyre's cry
It comes down to you
Vampyre's cry
Like God and always
Starved of blood and sick of head
Inside her broken doors and shatters
Wave come down and pushing through
Carry her where she wants to go to
Wave come down and pushing through
Carry her carry her
Vampyre's cry Pull me down
If ya come inside I can't help outside
You can't cry but you won't need to
Baby has found a way to surround
Surround herself in sorrow
If ya come inside I can't help outside
You should learn And God you'll need to
Get down down down inside the Devil
Get down down down inside the sun
If ya pick up things that don't belong
Something you will need to borrow
Your baby has found her God above
Yeah baby until tomorrow
If ya come inside I won't help outside
You can't cry You don't love
Baby has found her God above
Yeah baby don't need tomorrow
Get down down down inside the Devil
Get down down down inside the sun
I guess I know
Come see the fish on the waves
Call it fun I don't know
Under the earth
Under the earth
Under the earth
You did well devil
Family life
It's like puzzle pieces disconnected
Pictures frames will never find
This broken home my demons still reside
Mother
I just needed you to know
I am a lonely soul a kid flying his kite alone
Where do I go now
Everyone moved out
And father I needed you the most
Every time
I try
I see the same crow on the power line
He could have flown to any other home
but he'll never stop chasing mine
Hell never stop chasing mine
It's a strange
kind of comfort
learning to always love the cracks inside
broken homes
Mother
I just needed you to know
I needed you the most
but I'm still a kid in aging skin
and I will always love you both
We'll all stop singing songs
And start singing out our pain instead
I hope one day to bury the past so deep
My ghost can't find it
Is this you being yourself or
Acting on part to please someone else
Take a look at your health
Take a look in someone else's eyes
But don't deface yourself
Go on try to delete me
Deceive me you can't
I will destroy you
That demon inside before it destroys everything
At some point
You'll have to make a few decisions
Boundaries don't keep anybody out
They only fence us in
I've got myself and no one else
Our demons are made from a past
But we leave them a home in hell
I've got myself and no one else
And I am just fine with this
I've got myself and no one else
But I'm not okay who am I kidding
Is this you being yourself or
Acting on part to please someone else
Take a look at your health
Take a look in someone else's eyes
But don't deface yourself
Go on try to delete me
Deceive me you can't
I will destroy you
That demon inside before it destroys everything
I will destroy you
Leave now
While you still have the legs to take you
Go on try to delete me
Deceive me you can't
I will destroy you
That demon inside before it destroys me
Maybe I don't need to
Find a demon that plays well with mine
Maybe I need to let go
Of the hell I keep raising inside on my own
On my own
rewriting
So much heart so much time but not enough
We can't learn when things come easy
Now that we are prepared for war
Suicide doesn't end the pain
it passes to the ones you love and remains
When I speak such a word
are you uneasy with how it's heard
That's why they say may the dead rest in peace
Now that we are prepared for war
just stay you
Screaming through the soul
You're thinking like a god
Satan not surprised
The darkness has arrived
A smash between the eyes
You're helping cure this eye
Glibly closing in
No one hear you
Scream
Impotent god
Why won't you die
You're full of lies
Go to hell
Think you'll be reawaken
He thought to be in one
It would be a desire to be immortal
The bloody corpse is rot
They fear they'll burn like fire
My phantom wearing scars
Satan wants your head
So now you'll bleed for me
Evil disgusting rots
Spit in the face of your god
Screaming through the soul
You're thinking like a god
Satan not surprised
The darkness has arrived
A smash between the eyes
You're helping stab the eyes
Glibly closing in
No one hear you
Scream
Think you'll be reawaken
He thought to be in one
It would be a desire to be immortal
The slaughtered corpse is rot
Evil disgusting rots
Spit in the face of your god
Impotent god
Why won't you die
You're full of lies
Go to hell
Sons of fire
Save my soul
Suffering soul

Sacrificed and bruised for eternal life

Your fate is fulfilled

Why can't you dying

Take my hand I show you what pleasure is
Come with me to Satan's dreamland
Welcome to my Reich where nothing's holy ground
I scheme your soul
To escape is to die
Take the throne
The pain comes quick and impulsive
While and inverted cross is burned on your back
The blood pulsates when they pierces
The human flesh with an iron barliever
Die
Now raise your hands in the air
and with eyes filled of hate
Spit upon the holy crucifix
And scream out in lust
Deicide
Slowly life is floating away
And a demon from hell will rise
He is there to lead you
Upon the final path
To clear all the lies between heaven and hell
You have desecrated many victims
but your mind is still confused
Why
Oh let my victims please my only god
I am worthy to be a servant of Satan
I grant you power and yes you'll be my son
The transformation is completed
My soul has entered a demon from hell
The blood of Christians will be floating
And god will be pushed away from his throne
Fall
Now raise your hands in the air
Your eyes are filled with hate
You spit upon the holy crucifix
and scream out in lust
Deicide That's no screamhahaha
Life slowly are floating away
and a demon from hell arises
He is there to lead you

Der sku norske kallen byggja grenda i fred
Han bygde sÃÂÃÂ¥ stova av stokk og stein
Og rundt ho eit stabbur ei smia og stall
Han bygde sÃÂÃÂ¥ grenda av stokk og stein
Lika ved dÃÂÃÂ¸ra te trollgubbens hall
Der traff han sÃÂÃÂ¥ frua med stemme av gull
Lika ved dÃÂÃÂ¸ra te trollgubbens hall
Sangen lÃÂÃÂ¥t heller dyster og trist
Ho lengta etter frukter pÃÂÃÂ¥ kvist
Fra tinda og berg te fjorda og hav
Fekk hug te sitt rike mektig og stolt
Fra bloma og eng te skoga av gran
Der kor aldri nokon hadde ferdast bortved
Der sku norske kallen stela trollgubbens viv
Han gjekk sÃÂÃÂ¥ te smia og smidde sitt sverd
I songen te huldra han hÃÂÃÂ¸yrde sitt kall
Lika i strupen og trollgubben fall
SÃÂÃÂ¥ giftes han frua med stemma av gull
Could I see you for what you are 
Inconsequencial ways 
whatever way you try to change 
You always stay the same 
I don't worry anymore 
And try to find what's lost the way you were 
Impossible to say 
No matter how I can't explain 
There's nothing left to save 
On and on we try to mend these broken dreams 
On and on we try and never let it be 
Still I wonder all the more 
Have I seen you for what you are 
Upon the breaking day 
A synchronised unfelt decay 
Is there no other way 
On and on we try to mend these broken dreams 
On and on we try and never let it be 
This is not how it is 
This is only how it ends 
On and on again
Separate us now be the one you want to see 
Take it all apart find the way you want to be 
In my head it's full of lies 
Visions in our head prisoners of what remains 
In my head it's full of lies 
don't tell me don't justify 
So I can feel you through this complication 
So I can pull through towards my destination
Whatever way you are 
Whatever things you see 
All these things incomplete so far 
Whatever changes take 
Thru every life you fake 
This is the way you truly are 
Yet here with you seasons have changed 
The light has gone out in the rain 
And soon the time will come again 
Where you cannot see how it ends 
Whatever way you are 
Whatever things you dream 
It seems that you're trying much too hard 
Whatever chance you take 
another promise breaks 
You cannot escape the way you are 
I know you don't want to believe 
That everyone's turning to leave 
You fall like a glass to the floor 
And cry as they walk out the door 
You seem to be feeling you're free 
Now everyone's turning to see 
You've given them all that they need 
But you've got no blood left to bleed 
When the sun comes out again 
I see your shadow fade away 
Here with you seasons have changed 
The light has gone out in the rain 
And soon the time will come again 
Where you cannot see how it ends 
You seem to be running this way 
But no one can stop the pain 
You seem to want all this to go 
Until you are left alone
Betrayed a moment more by progress that we make 
Illusions of dimensions illogical machines 
Like a dreamworld you can't wake up from 
I can feel it driven by desperation 
Only you know what's hidden beneath it all 
You destroy it and can't see what went wrong 
Elusive inner sense unknowing of existence 
We never could decide to make another choice 
Like a dreamworld you can't wake up from 
Somehow I live somehow I try 
The time we lost I can't deny 
Somehow I learn in this I lose 
And all I'd give if I could choose 
what does it all mean  
it doesn't mean anything 
Standing still once more I try and disconnect 
I watch it break away beneath the fading sun 
Accepting eyes desensitized yet I can't bear it
So I live another day so I find another way 
where I try to succeed in this life 
and so I walk all the way all the while 
Unimpressed by what I've heard 
Can't relate to all the world 
and there are times when everything hurts 
What it takes I'll never know 
Deliverance of what we hope 
In a dream all the same we deny it 
Will I wonder why I've chosen to place 
a faith in the things I can't see 
Will I wonder why I've chosen to place 
a faith in the things I believe 
Faith for a while 
try for one day 
please for a while 
for all eternity 
So I live another day so I find another way 
and so I try to believe it this time 
where I don't chase the words of a liar 
So I give until it's worse 
I never care for what it's worth 
and there are times when everything hurts 
What it takes I'll never know 
Deliverance of what we hope 
In a dream all the same in denial
All the things that could have been I retreat 
Everyone just fades away 
and I'll never be afraid 
What can I say to you 
will we fall down will we pull through 
Tell you how far I've come 
And of all I've done since you turned away 
Silent in all that's come to pass I diverge 
and as I have been replaced 
I could never find a way 
There's nothing I'd say to you 
that could change this that would make this 
Something that cannot be 
For this memory is all that's left 
above and beyond 
Wishing that rain would fall again 
Playing the part you can't sustain 
If you wanted to see if you wanted to feel 
If you wanted to try if you wanted to heal 
You might open your mind 
but you can't close your mouth anytime 
I think you should know 
You'll end up alone 
I'm hearing you less every day 
Someone should take 
Your thoughts all away 
For all you would do to stay 
Sealing the fate which holds your name 
Can't comprehend can't take the blame 
Let me leave you to this 
and the truth you dismiss once again 
I think that you know 
You'll end up alone 
And suffer through all that you face 
As chances dissolve 
And solace evolves 
In this you will find your place
Wishing that rain would fall again 
Playing the part you can't sustain 
If you wanted to see if you wanted to feel 
If you wanted to try if you wanted to heal 
You might open your mind 
but you can't close your mouth anytime 
I think you should know 
You'll end up alone 
I'm hearing you less every day 
Someone should take 
Your thoughts all away 
For all you would do to stay 
Sealing the fate which holds your name 
Can't comprehend can't take the blame 
Let me leave you to this 
and the truth you dismiss once again 
I think that you know 
You'll end up alone 
And suffer through all that you face 
As chances dissolve 
And solace evolves 
In this you will find your place
So desperate to find another way to hold 
The doubts in my mind I never could find 
They're all I can see here 
If fate can't exist then I can't resist 
The doorway to new fears 
I am so alive 
suffice to say 
I will sacrifice my hopes away 
Another time and place much like it was before 
I've chosen to delay I've chosen to ignore 
If everyone knew then no one would try 
it's all complicated 
If nothing is found will no one believe 
The path we're betraying 
I am so alive 
I will sacrifice my heart away 
So many ways to go I wish I didn't know 
So many ways to go from here  
The pressure's closing in 
and soon I must begin 
So many ways to go from here 
Is this how it feels is this how it is 
To know what you're saying 
If nothing is found will you turn around 
And wish that you waited 
Was all this a lie 
Have I sacrificed my life away 
All I ever try 
Can't help wonder why it's still the same
What I see what I feel 
Will I try will I kneel 
We're out there and I fear 
Will I find anything again 
Will I see what you see 
Will I bleed what you bleed 
We're out here and I feel 
I will find everything the same 
Please just hear me 
I try to 
Just hear what I have to say 
So I can run to where you are 
So I can understand this time 
So I can run to where you are for one more time 
So I can take into my heart 
All the world and all the stars 
What I see what I feel 
A picture that's not real 
A symptom of our hope 
And all emotions turned to stone 
If I need what you need 
Then why can't we just be 
We're out here and I fear 
We'll never find our way again 
You don't hear me 
I try to 
Just hear what I have to say 
and I will run to where you are 
So we can understand this time 
So I can take into my heart 
All the world and all the stars 
I've traveled so far 
To be in this place 
A beautiful day 
It's such a shame 
In so many ways I was frozen 
For just one moment more I'd say 
In so many ways alone always 
However I try 
To see what it means 
No one would stay 
Stranded this way 
In so many ways I was broken 
For all the hopes I had inside 
Lay shattered among the past 
In so many ways I was holding 
Onto a fragment of my life 
When everything made sense sometimes 
Take this day and slow it down 
Feel the fear all around 
and Fly thru the night 
Would you give every thing away 
For the moment 
Take in the sight 
And just give everything away 
For a moment
I won't be wrong again 
This time I know it all 
I won't be wrong again 
This time will be my last 
I won't decide again 
Wherever I let it go 
Will I reprise again 
A shadow of my own 
In this we say I can relate 
I dissipate into the shade 
It just keeps on happening will I ever know why 
I'm always wrong again 
'only an oversight' 
I never leave it all 
and giving in despite 
If I opened up my eyes 
Would I see through her disguise 
Will I ever really know 
if I don't try 
In this we say I can relate 
I dissipate into the shade 
Now I see the way you look at me 
Enjoy the black demise
Betray you betrayers
Taste life blood from your own kind
Ignite waiting darkness
What you fear comes alive
Dry lips chant damnation
Driving man to self destruction
No one can save you now
Behold the black demise
Cursed gods have forsaken
The lands of ruined mankind
Invades human nature
This lost and perfect rapture
Evil domination
Driving man to self destruction
Enjoy the black demise
Taste life blood from your own side
Feel your flesh burning inside
Darkness blinds your perception
Driving man to self destruction
Enjoy the black demise
Mankind  Born to guilt and shame
Stand for For the gates of hell
Vision for the dead eye
A song for the deaf
One word for the possession
The icon of death
Daylight Still hide your sins
Lights out For the extinction begins
Vision for the dead eye
A song for the deaf
One word for the possession
The icon of the death
Time has come for extinction
My hatred for your race strengths my precision
Vision for the dead eye
A song for the deaf
One word for the possession
The icon of the death
Unleash the cholera on humanity
Manipulate the truth spread insanity
Giving the last shining to sun before the end
Days of eternal darkness
This is the war to break all the human chain
Awaken  beast lying deep in your brain
Final solution Mass execution
Sworn to destroy all your ways
One step into the fireFire
Declaring anti human manifest
War War War
Immortality
Bleed Bleed Bleed like a whore
Kneel on your knees suffer more and more
Blood Blood Blood for salvation
Dead by now creatures of hate universe
All shall die an existence nonsense
Praise the sins and the intense feelings
Burning down all the morals and beliefs
Made of bones these secret tombs
The place where we break cosmic chains
Dead by now creatures of hate universe
All shall die an existence nonsense
Hate
Then comes the hour of the abomination
Fall of human morals by the demonization
Anti human manifest supreme insanity
Forces never seen by the human eyes
Bringer of the pain and eternal suffering
Torture to flesh nonstop bleeding
Confused by the paradox everlasting
Son of thy desires and hate of god
Torture bleeding
Unlightened Forsaken Dishearten
Dishonour Forsaken Dishearten
Newborn spy
Ghost of the lie hidden in the secret
Rains of scum feeding the servant
Newborn spy spreading the message
Charming inside around the illusion

Rain of scum feeding the servant

Lost faith Burning years
Decade  Face your fears
Lights out Dying vision
This is your final test
Restless Marching towards
Human Weakest chain
Graveyard Rest in curse
Worship the shining order
Reign in darkness with creatures leading my way
Fading the fleshlight of those made of clay
Hunchback of faith starts bleeding day by day
Brightness saves you no more
Fleshlight's fading
God's sending light
Reflect fading light
Refuse burning bright
The war with the light will never end
Their blood flows through their last stand
Tear his chest for severe wounds
With sharp stakes and biting stones
Time to choose choose your side
It's time to die defend your sight
Time to choose choose your side
Time to die die for your fight
Here's the sign with a shining bone
Let him reign in his rotting throne
Nevermore blessed by the heaven's grace
Scream as you burn in the rising flames
Time to choose choose your side
It's time to die defend your sight
Time to choose choose your side
Time to die die for your fight
Lands of fire and flaming corpses
Crushed by the hands of shapeless fleshless
Seas of the blood and darkened sky
Let dawn fill with fallen's cry
If you're down again
Call my name and beg for me
Soon you die again
Die again and die again
Dig deep into your psyche do you find the scar
I have tried many times
To reveal my inner State of Mind
Must be blind
Can you see the substance of who you really are
Dig deep into your psyche do you find the scar
I know it's just a theory with elements of doubt
Broughtto shores across the sea
He dreamt it was his fate
Foughtto set an order pure
Facist world of hate
Pray  for outcasts sent to die
They have no hearts to fight
Pay  the dues you owe yourself
To free them on this night
A gasious rain falls down to stop the ones
Who speak the truth but lack the voice of guns
And they die
Tryto stop the man in charge
He fills our mind in fear
Cryfor those who've already died
Their killers won't shed a tear
Nighthas fallen premature
Darkness shades the land
Fightfor one last chance to live
And crush the killer's hand
I like to sleep all day
Go to work Ha no way
I see you work so hard
To pay your credit card
I see you bust your ass
To buy a new bus pass
So you can go to work
Like every other jerk
Every day's a holiday  Do you know what I mean
Every day's a holiday
Don't you wish you were just like me
I see you pay your dues
This is the life you choose
But nothing's guaranteed
Life's just a game to me
I see you bust your ass
So I think I'd rather pass
You buy the things you need
's all stuff I get for free
Every day's a holiday  Why work up a sweat
Every day's a holiday
Don't you wish you were just like me
Every day's a holiday
There's a method to madness
It measures in by the light
There's an evil among us
And it's blinding our sight
Propaganda deception
Their subliminal lies
Infiltrate the airwaves
The light in your eyes
Spellbound by the light
You don't have the right
To ever ask why
They're ruling your mind
Mass mental disorder
A generation ago
They're lost in confusion
Let you question the people
Who are plotting these schemes
When they silence your questions
When they shatter your dreams
Sever and Splice
Hatchet and knife
Torture and lust
Taking your life
Get away flee today bodies have been found
Deathly reek lawmen seek corpses of deceased
One dies by suicide  Took life by cyanide
One fled to foreign land  free now to kill again
Bent mind  A deadly rape
Run hide  He has escaped
Self employed self made scam
Like a child who forgot how to learn
Just conserving time
In this homemade prison he'll burn
Tongue like a rusty razor tricky and sharp
With eyes that seem so pure
Walk like a dusty soldier proud and sure
With a medal of his buddy's heart
There's the pitch looks like a curve
He who dies with the most toys wins
Faceless nameless they're all the same
He'll take your money with a toothy grin
Tongue like a rusty razor tricky and sharp
With eyes that seem so pure
Walk like a dusty soldier proud and sure
With a medal of his buddy's heart
Worse than the animal
The artist needs
The artist greeds
He bites the hand that feeds
Worse than the animal
The artist needs
The artist greeds
BITE
Floating in franklins like a pig in shit
He's got money to burn yours not mine
Material madness bashes him down
And sends the fucker to the end of the line
Tongue like a rusty razor tricky and sharp
With eyes that seem so pure
Walk like a dusty soldier proud and sure
With a medal of his buddys heart
Worse than the animal
The artist needs
The artist greeds
He bites the hand that feeds
Worse than the animal
The artist needs
The artist greeds
Just like a flame memory starts to burn
Out of the past voices reemerge
They bring to mind days when you were young
Bid life farewell when all is said and done
Shatter  Mirror cracks you see the light
Shudder  As death stares you in the eyes
Cry out  As your life comes to an end
Darkness  A loaded gun your only friend
The blade of time cuts away the years
Songs of lament are ringing in your ears
In from outside   MG images of death
Bid life farewell and catch your final breath
Recklessly they waged their wars
Open wounds behind closed doors
Shed your fears the morbid cheers
Apocalypse draws ever near
Laugh with sinners cry with saints
The life we lead has no restraints
No holds barred our bodies scarred
These creeps were made for marching hard
Reckless abandon living for today
The streets our schools defiance rules
Until the judgement day
Reckless abandon technicolor grey
One way to live one life to give
No morals to betray
Trapped by fear and locked away
To never see the light of day
Paranoid and selfdestroyed
The mind's eye scans the endless void
Let the death bell toll
The clock may stop the hand may fall
Untold lies of paradise
A wasted day a wasted life
Reckless abandon living for today
The streets our schools defiance rules
Until the judgement day
Reckless abandon technicolor grey
One way to live one life to give
No morals to betray
Take the time to redefine
Read the truth between the lines
Feed the frame of discontent
Time on earth is nearly spent
These four walls are closing in
The war that you can never win
Nothing ventured nothing gained
This hell on earth will never change
See now how I am
Care for noone
Don't give a damn
Dive in
To my mind
Search for some emotion you can't find
Feel numb
No pain
I'm lost
Won't you take my hand
Remember what you said
What we planned
Can't you
Forget my name
Some things change you'll stay the same
Feel numb
No pain
I'm lost
And I've changed
Dive into my mind
Search for some emotion you can't find
Feel numb
No pain
I'm lost
Feel numb
No pain
I'm lost
We break it down break it down
By trail of man the blood on our hands
by grasp and evil
Secrets from within is hidden in the past
wittingly by lies
today we shall die
Eliciting the dark just to bring it down
the bring it down bring it down
the torture and pain the dark that bind you
let it guide you
Secrets from within is hidden in the past
wittingly by lies
today we shall die
By the truth through the lies entering the fear
Entering evil
Remedy in heart
Remedy in heart dauntless together
Eliciting the dark when the gates are open
Struggle through pain force and torture
the valorous way now this day is over
Following the stellar lights
Path thru the dark
Of rotten limbs and piles of bones
Of hundreds ripped apart
By our heart of choice
Into the devils jaws
Fearless thru eternity
For a greater cause
Time we need time
To seal the challenge of our call
Time we need time
In the land of the lost
We are living the land of the living
We're living in the land of the lost
In the spur of the moment as we're giving it all
Giving it all away
With the strength of our will
Like heaven hell shall be
Rigorously we strive
Thru the dark side of me
Ascending from the realm of doom
In the beat to the devil's choir
Patronizing all of you
I'm the fruit of all your lies
I am the night I am the dark
That you always will fear
You're drowning in my hungering eyes
In my soul from darker sphere
Emptiness you'll find I'm near
Ground will tremble fast as you hear
Children's scream is loud in pain
Darkness calling out
Through the Hellbender night
I am back from the fire
Retribution is calling my name
In the darkness you'll hear
A serenade of doom in the silence
Precognition a warning
Still I'm lost but my visions is clear
Echoes of evil surmounted
Through the Hellbender night
Beside the slain and tortured
Who's crawling from my grave
Altered and disfigured creatures
Struggle to be saved
Through the ruins of divine
I shall rise again
You can see the world is turning
To your chagrin pain
Emptiness you'll find I'm near
Ground will tremble fast as you hear
Children's scream is loud in pain
Darkness calling out
Through the Hellbender night
I am back from the fire
Retribution is calling my name
In the darkness you'll hear
A serenade of doom in the silence
Precognition a warning
Still I'm lost but my visions is clear
Echoes of evil surmounted
Through the Hellbender night
I am back from the fire
Retribution is calling my name
In the darkness you'll hear
A serenade of doom in the silence
Precognition a warning
Still I'm lost but my visions is clear
Echoes of evil surmounted
Through the Hellbender night
One way one will one life
I'll pay the price
I walk through dark dimensions
Enslaved to my pain
Bound to walk through time
In rage and fury
My weakness I shall know
And stronger I shall grow
I listen to the beat of my heart
My way my time
It's time to break the chains
Following the beast from within
My will my life
It's time to break the chains
One chance one step one move
Beyond all my pain
In trust and understanding
Staid to my fate
Set to go as only I remain
My weakness I shall know
And stronger I shall grow
I listen to the beat of my heart
My way my time
It's time to break the chains
Following the beast from within
My will my life
It's time to break the chains
I listen to the beat of my heart
My way my time
It's time to break the chains
Following the beast from within
My will my life
It's time to break the chains
You've entered my sanctum and why may I ask
I'll wrap you up in fear
You paragon of chivalry alone in my dark
Devoted to your tears
I'm calling you out assign to me
Into my rage as one we shall be
In my darkness celestial warrior
You don't know who I am you don't know me at all
Still you call my name
I'm the evil you fear in the dark as you hear
The answers to your prayer
I'm calling you out assign to me
Into my rage as one we shall be
In my darkness celestial warrior
I'm calling you out assign to me
Into my rage as one we shall be
In my darkness celestial warrior
On your shoulder celestial warrior
Contorted souls imprisoned me
I'll face them strong I'll make them see
And by my hand I'll carve their minds
In wrath I'll mold them into one
Deceived betrayed by the renegade
Caress the breath of death and hate
I'll blaze the trail I'll sacrifice
I'll kill the pain I'll kill the lies
Abundance of divine wrath upon thy soul
Well concealed lies trust is forfeit
Soiled along your glorious pride
Bereaved is loss I will start my vengeance
And seek the truth of my heart
All the hatred which tears my soul
Fuels the carnage I will wreck
The worst of your dreams is what will befall
Amidst the hatred you walk
The bringer of death is the bringer of truth
Dazed to the shadows you fall
Words of wisdom out of the abundance of a heart
The desecrated powers will bring
The sound of hate I pursues
You know who I am and where I will be
Solace you'll find in the truth
Words of wisdom out of the abundance of a heart
I'm melting my body just disappears
I'm lost and I'm fading away
Something is holding a grip of me
I stare in its eyes and its fury is me
Liaise with thy mind and remember my name
A quietly intense approach
at the behest of the dead
Staid in my mind
Raised by the sage from the kingdom of heaven
Destined to walk in the darkness of hell
Sadness and tears it all comes back to you
Due to atrocious reminisce of days gone by
I'll show my obeisance to the dark
I salute the demon I've become
My devilish shape is my camouflage
Liaise with thy mind and remember my name
You're bringing me all this pain
Yet I'll sanctify thy name
Staid in my mind
Following my destiny in my pledge to you
Relentlessly endure everything that's in my way
Into a blast of evil by dint of faith
Among the desecrated with pride we call
A journey through our pain still standing tall
Absence of trust we shall go back
Into the chamber of doom
A silent call foray in hell
And in trust we gain
Into the storm of darkness set once again
We're lined up all together a strive in vain
The troops of evil forces fearless in death
Pinned to the doors of hell to take our breath
Tears of feign we fall and we rise again
And nothing we gain
Absence of trust we shall go back
Into the chamber of doom
A silent call foray in hell
And in trust we gain
Tears of feign we fall and we rise again
And nothing we gain
Absence of trust we shall go back
Into the chamber of doom
A silent call foray in hell
And in trust we gain
Join me
Voices saying to beware war closing in
I raise my fist to justify relentlessly I stay
Enlighten evilness the black sun rises
Cold blood flows through our veins
As we walk through the fire of fight
The warlords of doom
We've just been invited to the devils dance
I don't remember where I've been
Nothing is real but the pain that I feel
My body is throbbing and my soul is torn
Of darkness and evil inside my head
Aligned with insanity barely awake
In obscurity of my whereabouts
Yet I choose my allegiance to you
In dubiety of the right thing to do
No matter who we are no matter where we've been
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter what we say no matter what we do
We'll fall into oblivion
The night has fall and you're pulling my strings
As an allied in death as a voice from within
In mind and sense I hate what you are
A reflection of life and the hate that it brings
But a glint of hope perceived by my sense
Like a smile on a face I couldn't ask for more
It makes me contented and staid to my call
The ordeal in life is a journey for all
No matter who we are no matter where we've been
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter what we say no matter what we do
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter who we are no matter where we've been
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter what we say no matter what we do
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter who we are no matter where we've been
We'll fall into oblivion
No matter what we say no matter what we do
We'll fall into oblivion
A silent walk to eternity elated on my way
One step at a time closer to my grave
Evil lurking for my soul but I am not afraid
Moving strong towards the endings of my days
Never looking back never mourn of what's lost
My time is closing in and it's time to move on
My heart of choice sets me free I am flying high
Here I'll be waiting
Don't you forget what it means by a silent walk
Into the eternity
Traces in time of what once was mine
It all has blow away for something new
All the pain is gone all is left behind
Life has passed me by I'm marching into next
Never looking back never mourn of what's lost
My time is closing in and it's time to move on
My heart of choice sets me free I am flying high
Here I'll be waiting
Don't you forget what it means by a silent walk
Into the eternity
My heart of choice sets me free I am flying high
Here I'll be waiting
Don't you forget what it means by a silent walk
Into the eternity
They cut away
The sickness
Out of all of us
They wash away
The pain
Wash it away
Now everyone
Is dead
There's nothing
To regret
As the world goes
Down the drain
Into the pit
Into the fire
They shall burn
Into the pit
Into the fire
They fall after all
They roar
Without voice
Stalking like cats
And read out
Their note
That leaves 'em
No choice
Between fire
And rope
They run
Like the rats
But nobody leaves
Easton Hope
Defenseless 
I'm broken
The future lies
Under a stormy sky
I never thought
It'd come so far
Come hold me
And love me
For it may be
The last time
In our life
That we feel warmth
You all wear
My crown
For I will take
You down
Into my agony into my agony
This ground
Will be a grave
Forsaken
And depraved
This is our destiny
This night
I'm burning
My love tonight
Inside she's dying
In cleansing light
You have to pay
The ferryman
I bring deliverance
I make the way
I paid the ferryman
Ten years ago
They roar
Without voice
Stalking like cats
And read out
Their note
That leaves 'em
No choice
Between fire
And rope
They run
Like the rats
But nobody leaves Easton Hope
Praise and serve
The machine
And choke
In its steam
They roar
Without voice
Stalking like cats
And read out
Their note
That leaves 'em
No choice
Between fire
And rope
They run
Like the rats
But nobody leaves Easton Hope 
Praise and serve
The machine
And choke
In its steam 
Desolate and obsolete
A figure on the crest
A bleeding heart in a nothingness
That is never gonna rest
Nobody hears the calling
Forcing me to be on my own
Nobody'll see me falling
Far away from hope and my home
Hold my hand
Look into my eyes
Now there's time to say
Goodbye  alone in my darkness
I cry  tears of sand
And die  remember my last
Goodbye
Desolate and obsolete
A figure on the crest
A bleeding heart in a nothingness
That is never gonna rest
Nobody hears the calling
Forcing me to be on my own
Nobody'll see me falling
Far away from hope and my home
Hold my hand
Look into my eyes
Now there's time to say
Goodbye  alone in my darkness
I cry  tears of sand
And die  remember my last
Goodbye 
Easton Hope
He had a
Faithful masterplan
And a friend below
One of the kind
That leaves
Different traces
In the snow
All that's not
Friend is foe
For he's the one
To ease the pain
Believe in deliverance
Watch the world
Become insane
Our fortune
Is turning
As we're opening
The oldest seals
The whole world
Will be burning
Until I'll have
My fate revealed
We were deceived
By his masterplan
And his friend below
One of the kind
That leaves
Different traces
In the snow
To him even
Friend is foe
For he's the one
To seize the pain
Death means deliverance
And resistance is in vain
Night falls on Easton Hope
My light is shining as the last
Night falls on Easton Hope
A fading memory from the past
Our fortune
Is turning
As we're opening
The oldest seals
The whole world
Will be burning
Until I'll have
My fate revealed
Night falls on Easton Hope
My light is shining as the last
Night falls on Easton Hope
A fading memory from the past
Watch your step
As you stray
And walk through
The darkness that
Used to be our home
The fate of us all just
Lies in the hands of
A name on the
Gravestone
And the poet dies
Our time runs out and
The world just keeps
Turning and turning
And spinning around
What keeps us going
As our love is
Burning and
Burning down
To the ground
Stay weak and follow
into the depths of hell
Live your life so hollow
In a freezing shell 
Night falls on Easton Hope
My light is shining as the last
Night falls on Easton Hope
A fading memory from the past
We are the fist
Of the fallen ones
The demise of
This lost nation
The loss of aspiration
We're on a path
Far beyond our fate
Kneedeep in the dead
Cold inside and
Mad from hate
There's no forgiveness
And we'll pay the price
Nothingness regains
Territory lost to vice
Once everyone was
Free in this land
Now a thousand
Year old legacy
Gives away
To seas of sand
All you
All men in the dark
You never saw
The light of day
Never were alive
Welcome liberty
All life is changing
No more unity
In a world
Rearranging
The threat is gone
But will we find
A place to leave
The pain behind
Faces change
And so do the names
Just the sorrow
Stays the same
And day by day
I look into
What is left of
Good thoughts
In their heads
Between anger and hate
There's nothing left
No salvation
Everything inside is dead
All you
All men in the dark
You never saw
The light of day
Never were alive
Welcome liberty
All life is changing
No more unity
In a world
Rearranging
One for all
And all for one
Two stand tall
While all is gone
Three times we had
To be the night
For there's just one way
To reach the light 
Welcome liberty
All life is changing
No more unity
In a world
Rearranging 
I lost my heart on the eastern shore
To a whisper on the wind
And all that I knew was no more
Did I reach my journey's end
All alone here fire's dying
Somewhere far away
Will I break and give up trying
Or burn another day
I wasted half my life
But all I ever wanted
Was a clearer view of myself
I broke my back with all the things
That I considered
And now there's nothing left of it
And the ashes of fathers
Now cover the track
In a land where fortune is borrowed
In these days where all luck
Is just leaving the sad
In the air just thoughts full of sorrow
Through all these dark years
Full of grief pain and fears
We knew our fate is linked
'till we're ashes in the wind
Another darkness another repose
Is what I yield to thee
Don't fear the veil nor my cold embrace
For it will set you free
And the ashes of fathers
Now cover the track
In a land where fortune is borrowed
In these days where all luck
Is just leaving the sad
In the air just thoughts full of sorrow
Through all these dark years
Through all these dark years
Full of grief pain and fears
We knew our fate is linked
'till we're ashes in the wind
Through all these dark years
Through all these dark years
Through all these dark years
Menacing black clouds
Raise misgivings
And loom over us
And the story begins
From the start
Nothing remains
Nothing stays
Nothing ever
Will change
Even death
Can not keep us apart
These shades
Even hide the sun
Leader follow leaders
Misdeeds can't be undone
All that man has built
Lands of faith
And guilt will fall
Cause nothing remains
Money sin and lust
All this turns to dust
They fall
And nothing remains
A single black corbie
Still sings it's song
For me and lives
The world is turning
So fast
A deafening silent cry
And I still wonder
Why we live
The world is
Turning so fast
Turned out to be dead
I'm burning
My love tonight
She's dying
In cleansing light
Oh no though we
Knew it's part
Of the game
It seemed so mandatory
But who can take the
Blame
All that man has built
Lands of faith
And guilt will fall
Cause nothing remains
Money sin and lust
All this turns to dust
They fall
And nothing remains
A last warm sense
Is dying into emptiness
It's just a follow up of things we left for dead
The world is turning
People in search
Of the light
Our homes are burning
As we stay the last
Falling star in the night
Fade with the first light of day
All you
All men in the dark
You never saw
The light of day
You never were alive 
All that man has built
Lands of faith
And guilt will fall
Cause nothing remains
Money sin and lust
All this turns to dust
They fall
And nothing remains
Seven hundred
Years of light
On the seventh day
They fall
Let the day that will
End their bloodline
Be the last for us all
The world is turning
People in search
Of the light
Our homes are burning
As we stay the last
Falling star in the night
Fade with the first light
Of day breaks
And nothing remains
In the light of day
Watching all these empty faces
Empty is what I've become
Everywhere just lonely places
Everywhere since you have gone
The rain pours down on me
And it will when I'm back in
People in black shake my hand
But I can't even feel my skin
Life became an endless struggle
That tears me apart
Living means to live for
But for what without a heart
On the window there's a fingerprint
I watch it 'till the light grows dim
All my tears they fall on the floor
In a home you will roam no more
Like the sun I go down unnoticed without sound
Every new day is worse than the night was before
I will always remember
What this requiem stands for
Three trials before you leave the shore
Mastering the sword
Learn the art of thievery
And find treasures galore
Get a ship and a crew of three
And search the foreign lands
And when the wind of hell embraces thee
You'll gain the idol of many hands
A black sky above our kingdom beneath
Die in the waves or live on your knees
Come raise the flag of the fallen
We reign the storm and the seas
And live our lives on the brink of death
WE'RE PIRATES And we are free
Trust the navigator's head
For all the rum and grog don't forget to revel
For tomorrow you could be dead
And beware of falling in love at all
Or your heart will beat inside a chest
'guess you figured it out  what I recall 's
Another story from another quest
A black sky above our kingdom beneath
Die in the waves or live on your knees
Come raise the flag of the fallen
We reign the storm and the seas
And live our lives on the brink of death
WE'RE PIRATES And we are free
Come raise the flag of the fallen
We reign the storm and the seas
And live our lives on the brink of death
WE'RE PIRATES And we are free
Now you all know
The words that echo back at me
One world no future
We will bring them to their knees
The walls are falling
We'll never surrender
The walls are falling
The downfall of splendor
When there's nothing left to lose
And the sun won't shine
On one of us again
We'll throw away
Our shattered dreams
Burning all the bridges to the past
And there's nothing left to lose
And the sun won't shine
On one of us again
And we throw away
Our shattered dreams
Burning all the bridges to the past
Without lies or belief
Without need to conceive
Without chance to restart
We're sharing the black heart
Now they are gone
No words that echo back at me
One world  no future
It brings us all to our knees
And we see now nothing's sacred
As the fire takes it all
To this day our lives are wasted
Noone cares as mankind falls
Silence lies over the town
Smoke and dust everywhere you
Look around
We both stand on the hill
Where once the old one stood
And look over the place that once
Was a symbol for the good
We brought darkness
Downfall and death
A thousand souls in the fire
We were puppets
And fools in this mess
But put an end to the liar
Now all is done
We're the ones that prevailed
All of the hope is gone
Now all is gone
We're the ones that have failed
All of our work is done
Ashes trickle
Through my fingers
A fateful ruin
Is everything that lingers
A single doll I saved
A silent witness wellbehaved
I will keep you in loving memory
And the sun goes down
We are the hearts
That remain
Easton Hope
We'll never
See you again
We are the hearts
That remain
Easton Hope
We'll never
See you again
All we believed in
All that we lived for
All of the hope
Is forever lost nowDarkness devours me again
the whirling black depth of abyssmal night
And he stands before me like a dreadful prophet
like some ancient Mysteriarch
O those eldritch eyes
they glow like sorcerous orbs
like fearful stars of unseen spheres
wise with the secrets of Time
I know he came for me
through the vast gateways of hell
passing from fearful grey worlds
hidden deep in nightmare's well
The ravenous demons of time fed upon me
like vultures upon the flesh
O cryptical phantasm let me drown
with the oblivious flow of nonexistence
Come swiftly sublime spectre
reveal the endless voids that Night does hide
Spread thine empyreal wings
and lead me to the vast eternity of dark
How long have we sought after the forbidden gate
that opens into unknown spheres
How long have we fathomed
the sky for the starpinioned gods of Space
Like phantoms of an ancient necropolis
we wander in the labyrinth of Life
where reigns the dreadful Tyrant
great Chimera of Time
to this waste realm of gloom
What supreme ravenous and insatiable will
rent us from our empyreal abode
How could we defy the old seraphic ban
and reenter the fabled gates of heavens
What luminous galaxies have been thy prey
O allconsuming restrainless Space
O indivisible infinity
O unrevealed Abyss
whose deep sustains flaming triumphant suns
what furtherdistant worlds doth thee hide
in thy universeulterior vast
O direful chasm
elder gods' necropolis
what starpossessed realms
rest within thy depths
Now as the Night takes form upon the face of sun
a world hidden and arcane arise
from cryptical depths hinderless and stark
One with night's perplexed mystery
unrevealed by the scyhted moon's light
phantoms of times remote gather
beneath the bizzare livid sky
Behold this darkling realm
filled with mysteries of aeons bygone
of the dreamwoven sisterworld
Beyond these phantasmguarded gates
where gyving Time and Space are not
awaits a world ulterior a realm unexplored
large as Infinity
Now as the Night takes form upon the face of sun
a world hidden and arcane arise
from cryptical depths hinderless and stark
Behold this is a stranger earth
a moonlightdrenched enchanted land
a world wherein all the cares of life are forgot
a longsought realm of wonder
Where have you gone
O old Gods of Earth
what far planetpaven ways doth you walk
Upon the marginless sky
where once your chariots rolled
now a cruel and ravenous tyrant enthrones
Shall you come to us
in staremblazoned dreams
mounted on silverhaired unicorns
Shall you appear again
proud gods of old
in the blaze of sidereal multitude
O blinded fools of Jahve
behold the creation of your lord
Earth is now but a rigid semblance
of a longdead once wondrous world
a ruined pantheon of beauty
a vast sepulchre of gloom
O blinded fools of Jahve
behold the creation of your lord
The Huntress rides no more 
the Elder gods left this hoary planet
And remains not faith enough to bring them back
Pan to his wood Artemis to her moon
Unfathomable Sea whose waves are years
Ocean of Time whose waters of deep woe
Are brackish with the salt of human tears
Thou shoreless flood which in thy ebb and flow
Claspest the limits of mortality
And sick of prey yet howling on for more
Vomitest thy wrecks on its inhospitable shore
Treacherous in calm and terrible in storm
Who shall put forth on thee
Unfathomable SeaFrom the plains of power
Whine the last stormy winds
For the guardian of Midgard
A final journey begins
By Odin's side
With the aesir gods behind
A distant voice enters his mind
Lord of the sky you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods
With the hammer you have crushed
All who stood in your way
But strength and deity
Won't help you on the final day
As chaos reigns
And the Valkyries sing
A warning is sent only for him
Lord of the sky you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods
Lord of the sky you're running out of time
The serpent will poison your sublime
Thunder and lightning may have dyed your blood
But you can't escape the twilight of the gods
Charioteer  You're a warrior without peer
When you think you're alone
The eyes of the world will read your mind for me
I'm the author of life
The maker of love and hate tragedy and fate
I'm the chain you're the slave
I'll be there from the cradle to the grave
All wars were mine created for joy
I'm guilty of every crime
When you cry in tears I smile in delight
I am the answer to what you fear
And all that you see
My pleasure is your destiny
When you stand in the rain
Abandoned and naked I can not deny
My desire to plague
I'm the wolf you're the lamb
In my world you are forever damned
All wars were mine created for joy
I'm guilty of every crime
When you cry in tears I smile in delight
I am the answer to what you fear
And all that you see
My pleasure is your destiny
Once you're born you'll find yourself
Placed behind the scenes of the theatre of pain
Dazed and hollow you will dwell
All wars were mine created for joy
I'm guilty of every crime
When you cry in tears I smile in delight
I am the answer to what you fear
And all that you see
My pleasure is your destiny
The moon is high but no one knows
What's landed by the bay
In your town soon blood will flow
Just before the dawn of day
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
For your gold and the slaughter
We have sailed far on stormy waters
Many coasts have been conquered and laid to rest
On our great neverending quest
There is nothing to stop the northern rage
In this dark and violent age
We slay every one of you as we enjoy our sins
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
For your gold and the slaughter
We have sailed far on stormy waters
Many coasts have been conquered and laid to rest
On our great neverending quest
There is nothing to stop the northern rage
In this dark and violent age
Longing for glory
We're the masters of the sea
Anger's our story
Gold and blood are all we need
Encouraged by the Gods
Our journey shall go on forever
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
Warriors from the land of the midnight sun
Wield your axes for live shall none
For your gold and the slaughter
We have sailed far on stormy waters
Many coasts have been conquered and laid to rest
On our great neverending quest
There is nothing to stop the northern rage
In this dark and violent age
Welcome to earth
A circus where the clowns are in control
Welcome to life
A state of hysteria programmed in your soul
Don't talk don't think
Don't feel stay out of the way
Just be glad and grateful
For your soon ending days
We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
There's justice for all
Behind the beautiful but false facade
Here women and men
Don't talk don't think
Don't feel stay out of the way
Just be glad and grateful
For your soon ending days
We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
Almighty father thank you for all
The fun and excitement on your great ball
No matter what you have planned for us
We'll perform until we fall
We are all the chosen ones
Dressed up for God's masquerade
Without a stage and audience
We dance the fool's ballet
So you want to hear a tale you say
A true story from my younger days
I'll try to recall so now listen well
As I tell you about this demon from Hell
For we all knew that the worst was yet to come
As the prophecy foretold the foul demon returned
And the noble king Tharngrim painfully learned
Well the story has come to an end
I hope you have enjoyed the tale my friend
But listen to me and listen well
They do exist these demons from Hell
So now be sure to remember my son
That Chaos snare the unwary one
The unwary one
My life is a bloody mess
To my body I have no access
I know what is right but I'm not in charge
I can't let go of the knife
That I just have raised to end your life
One more awful crime to torture my mind
Let me out Let me out of here
I just can't take it no longer
Let me go and leave me alone
Before I go insane
Born to run and follow the sight
Of despair chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
In panic I am damned to live my life
My actions are not of my will
But they seem to give my brain a thrill
I can not resist my heinous slaughter
I'm caught in a mad machine
Destruction and death are all I've seen
How can I escape this hellish nightmare
Let me out Let me out of here
I just can't take it no longer
Let me go and leave me alone
Before I go insane
Born to run and follow the sight
Of despair chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
Born to run and follow the sight
Of despair chaos and fright
Desperate taking soul after soul
I'm out of control
In panic I am damned to live my life
Like the day we fell from grace
But today valour shall prevail
Revealing a forest of spears
Well this time they will be crushed
Charge
The thunder of pounding hooves below
Heralds the doom of our foes
Like thunder we descend upon our prey
For our shame they will pay
Might and honour
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war
We attack the tainted scum
Our hearts filled with fierce joy and hope
Or bow our heads in shame
By death or victory our honour shall be restored
So in the name of our Lord
Charge
The thunder of pounding hooves below
Heralds the doom of our foes
Like thunder we descend upon our prey
For our shame they will pay
Might and honour
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war
With fury singing in our veins
We smite our fallen leader's bane
Our hammers are smashing a gory
Path to redemption and sweet glory
Might and honour
Might and valour
Once again the White Company of Wolves rides
Into battle and war
Into battle and war
Another day to fight for my unspoken rights
How can you say it's worth the price
You pay in a cage of lies
Another chapter in the daily book if sin
Here I'm supposed to walk along
A path which I know is wrong
You may say I aim too high
But I know what I have to do
I can't see the reason why
The old dream should not come true
Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
You can not raise a family
Lost in a fantasy
Detested by the fools who never break a rule
But their eternal jealousy
Won't change my destiny
You may say I aim too high
But I know what I have to do
I can't see the reason why
The old dream should not come true
Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
When dreams and memories collide
I'll be leaving for the final ride
Just like the wind I'll travel across the seas
Under skies of glory I will fly forever free
Laughing at the pain in my past
Out of the void
Against the wind of madness
Into tomorrow I sail with my hope
No time to waste
I'm heading for the future
I'll carry on till I finally reach
My burning vision
Rain  A million tears to the ground
Wind  The unmistakable sound of war
The rebellion has begun
Our freedom must be won
To the castle of tyranny we ride
Tear down the walls
Hunt the King out of his halls
Dethrone the One and we'll be in command
What ever we'll meet
We won't surrender nor retreat
Freedom we claim to the Shadowland
No more lies Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland
Fight for all the painful years
When all we felt was fear
Drawn by insurrection we will prevail
Closer we come
Now we know what's to be done
The message we have for his majesty
Die tonight
No more lies Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland
Rebels of the brave
Never loose your faith
Let us end it all tonight
Hold on to your hearts and fight
No more lies Let the crown of the tyrant fall
It's the final battle of the Shadowland
Glory days and peace are waiting for us all
It's the revolution of the Shadowland
Shadowland
Shadowland
Shadowland
Drifting around our sad and mundane reality
An astral plane filled with strange harmony
Where the dead march on through infinity
But I don't know where they go
No one's come back to tell me the truth
Have you ever wondered what's beyond
Your terrestrial life and corporal bonds
Have you ever pondered on what's out there
When your life is over and finished here
The greatest mystery of all
On golden rays of light On shining silvery beams
Dancing slowly towards the unknown
To a place our Maker has shown
Well I don't know where they go
No one's come back to tell me the truth
Have you ever wondered what's beyond
Your terrestrial life and corporal bonds
Have you ever pondered on what's out there
When your life is over and finished here
The greatest mystery of all
All these souls like a billion fires
Illuminate the void as life expires
But like grains of sand they are blown astray
On a terminal voyage
On a terminal voyage they sail
On a terminal voyage they sail away
Lies empty words in the wind
A tragic melody
Unwise is the one who believe in tomorrow
The shade of a loser never fades away
Until the story ends
But there is a light where I lonely stray
And the light is you my friend
Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence
Free is the one with a name
Carved in a tombstone
Tell me am I the one to blame for my life
The pain is eternal when I realise
All my thoughts were true
There's neither a Heaven nor a paradise
All I can believe is in you
Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silence
I see her face in the crowds
The darkness and the clouds
I'll wait for her until
I find eternal tranquillity
Silent angel from above
Take me on your wings of love
Fly me far away from here
Show me the way to the silenceAs we feast
Upon her meat
In the dark of night
Taste of flesh
On my breath
I swallow her insides
Pool of Blood
Around her head
From the sledge hammer
Limb from limb
Skin to skin
Excitement fills my eyes
She wont know
What Ive done
Helpless as she was
Twisted Bitch
In this ditch
I am Devouring
DEVOURING
DEVOURING
Grasp the head
Cut with saw
Decapitated now
Headless Body
Lying there
Naked on the ground
Again I feast
Upon her meat
Intestines fill my mouth
Drape her flesh
On the grass
Maggots start to form
Smash her skull
Split in two
Brains fall to the floor
What Ive done
Im not sure
I know I want some more
DEVOURING
DEVOURING
Devour  Devouring 
Carve my name
In her back
Leaving them a clue
Devouring
What I can
Her body was my food
Need more victims
For my urge
Thoughts run through my mind
Another girl
Another night
More flesh to devour
Flesh I crave
Im insane
Hideous acts of torture
She lies dead
With no head
Time to Devour
DEVOURING

Believing  The Rapture
Coming of Christ Denied

Jesus Will Not Return
Drawn and quartered
Cornered and caged
Fighting for old flags
A lions share waged
Keep your boots on  Stick to your guns
This is where we'll make our stand
Our kind does not make old bones
Got the devil at pointblank 
Chance is feeble  Chance is gone
I'll beat the reaper this last time
In this hellhole I swear I will not die
As the ghost of war slowly sweeps the ground
We're riding home in a long black box
With bloodstained flag and silver handles
Like rats we ran towards the gates of Hell
Hooked between a ruin and a warblade 
The Devil swept the ruins
Now I long for the valley of death
There's no coming back from where you're going
Death before surrender
We dug our heels in hard
Always go down fighting
Claim victory in your heart
Keep your boots on  Stick to your guns
Death comes reaping fast tonight
Hell walks among us  Turning men into dogs
Pinned down and dying to fight
Uncompromising and unconditional
Unrelenting and unbound
This is no place for bloodless cowards
Watching distant cities burning to the ground
We saw the circling death from above
We had the advantage Now it's deathabsolute
Whiteline warfare is eating up your head
Fusing nerves and flesh to bone
You run until your dead
Running through the piss and blood 
Brain like a hornets' nest
You run on top your brothers dead
While fouling your own nests
Poisoning the mother lands
This fury's next to Hell
The savage smears their face like flees
Riding rats through the iron rain
It rips in veins like the Devils fist
Sweating blood in a hole in the ground 
The land will ring with the wailing
Of your widows funeralhounds
Speedkrieg  No I won't stop until I die
Speedkrieg  Hang'em high under iron skies
Speedkrieg  You cannot holt this panzergrip 
Speedkrieg  Now ride the carnage  Ride
Running with the devil
There is black water in the wells
Steel gazed warfleet raving forth
Between bullets and trembling limbs
There's a deathstench drifting on the wind
Can you smell it  The worms and the gas
As the skies fills to the rapingpoint
With vultures and black flies
Indoctrination 
Obey the steel limb grasp
Harnessed into weapons
As you ride the storms of blight
Snarling at the gallowmoon
Come running with all Hell
Mind narrows to a pinpoint state
Marching To the funeral bells
Now march with death
There is no holding back this time
There is no second chance
To live and fight under the blitz
You die in battlelights
Pushing on forever further
In this frenzied state of mind
As the battlelust burns through your vein
You Boil alive inside
All right
Suicide formations
Are you ready  Tension'
Speedkrieg
There is no holding back this time
There is no second chance
To live and fight under the blitz
You die in battlelights
Pushing on forever further
In this frenzied state of mind
As the battlelust burns through your vein
You Boil alive inside
You climb the dead like mongrel dogs
You scream with bone dry tongues 
Side by side mind reels to dust 
Pushing on and on
Pain and hate like fuel and fire
Explodes into your veins
Consumed by carnage  Storming forth
Infernos in their eyes
There is no holding back this time
There is no second chance
To live and fight under the blitz
And die in battlelights
Pushing on forever further
In this frenzied state of mind
As the battlelust burns through your veins
Boiling alive inside
It has grinded and worn my soul
Into a spiritscraped shadow
The Devil's always on my shoulder
As I'm cursed beyond  Recognition
The Devil was in my bones last night
One heel on the shovel
Pale horse by my side
Now I bleed black  I bleed napalm
As I rot in this cage of my soul
Crawling out of the woodwork it comes
A thousand times  A thousand nights
In endless repetition
Cursed Beyond Recognition
This mammoth ironcross to drag
Driving bargains with the Devil
The Devil was in my flesh last night
Cursing bone upon bone
As I'm born to the black
In every fear  In every way
Like a straightjacket nailed to the soul
Now all food turns to ash in my mouth
Like a rat in a maze
Trapped in mental lockdown
Yet my pound of flesh  I will always get
Leave my soul for the reapers in wait
This heart beats in a rotten chest
Soul and spirit ripped loose from its flesh
Come deathworms black  And lead the way
To my corner of this abyss
Dreams of devils giving birth to crippled spawn
Like led it burns through my rotting veins
Each night I dream of Hell
Oh no No I won't go
I'll rather die spitting fire from below
No omen's black enough
To eclipse this rotten soul
For Nocturnal is the beast of this code
Soul desecrated  Standing on the brink of Hell 
As all my bones are slowly grinded
Nerves and flesh is now my cell
The Devil calls through days of strife
Howling me back into the dark
Into the screaming voids
Into the cursed encroaching night
Skin lamps are Burning
Bones are thinnin'
Devil's on the loose
Fresh flay for the taking
The Grotesque walk like arachniddead
En route to incineration
Time drags its heel here
Digging shallow graves
In timeless petrifaction
Devil's foulest mistress
Morbid love of death
Only mean bones in this body 
Unbridled sadistic bitch
SheWolf  Oppressor
The pleasures of her flesh
She carries her madness to the bone
Serrated bride of death
Oh you fucking Devilswhore
She loved it to death
You will know no rest
No there aint' no warm bodies here
This cruelty's coming from Hells heart
A soulless dead mind cold as steel
Under callous beatings
Into degraded wretched wrecks
Violated flayed and rotting
Under the Ironhex
The Bitch of Buchenwald
The Bitch of Buchenwald
Deadskin lust burning through her brain
Ravenous bitch howling insane 
The Bitch of Buchenwald
The Bitch of Buchenwald
The Bitch of Buchenwald
In untamed callous wickedness
Malicious lifecontrol
Can you see the skin lamps burning in the night
Beneath the searchlight towers
Hyenaexcruciator hemming you inn
By the light of a thousand cleavers
Falling asleep for this very last time 
To the sound of the funeralfurnace screaming
Rattling bony fingers
Rattling chains to hold your soul
This appetite for death is unrelenting
Skin harvest lunacy
Ironclad in certainty
Death is release  No hope or illusion
Immolation delirium
So insipid and impure
Draped in scraps of human flesh
This bitch will flay you raw
Unquenchable bloodthirst boiling
In boundless tribulation
Pure undiluted madness
In prolonged putrefaction
Hordes of bombers coming inn
Lungs filled with fire  At war again
Midnight in the firing line
Deathbaptism  Jumping the mines
Hanoi Hannah screaming out her lies
VC's like insects swarming in like tides
The junglerot eating flesh alive
Agent orange  Fire at will
Running  Praying  And dying
Deployed into this jungle Hell
Searching  Blasting  Through fire
As we climbed with mad abandon
Every goddamned hill
Sundown in paradise through melted eyes
Pouring molten lava from the skies
Arclite over Hochiminh 
Senses sharpened  Like knives to win
It's been our fate since we came to base
To pick the Joker and not the Ace
From Da'Nang to the DMZ
Through the endless rain
The first and only  The last of many
In the A'ShauValley we rot  Cored from bone
Napalm Nights
Napalm Nights
Release the napalm
Storms of napalm coming inn
Carpet bombing  At war again
Striking first and strike them fast
Skin burnt to crisp  And bones to black
Mekong Deltastyle  Bagged and tagged
Rolled in napalm and burning rags
We'll take this hill  Now raise that flag
The magic dragon  The napalm roar
Bullet benediction  Here the reaper call
I saw the deathcard Joker
On that faithful final night
As reenforcements came in the cloak of napalm
Upholding the banner
This yellow fever will not stop 
We're stuck up here  On Hill937
Coming in fast and low
Like a carpet of certain death
A blast of napalm winds and ironashes
Running for the choppers
GI's on the Hueyskids
Through crotchrot and jungledeath
Bugs and Charlies' everywhere
Come in Whiskeycompany
Scorched flesh and skin burned black
For every limbless marine and firewalker
 We salute you
Call for the steamhammers
Tear down these walls
Welcome to the oldschool
We never walk alone
A rebel to the end
Running with the pack
With the restless wolves
Howling from the gutterlands
And crawling in the underground
From rustbelt to the ironplains
I call it Metal  And it's life in real
Now pick up your teeth it's time to fight
Pounding those fists  Fuel the madness
Stand back  Get out of the way
No bone unbroken  No boots are unthread
Raising the banner every day
There aint no one here but these bastard
The high voltage runs in our souls
Bring out those killerwatts
We're born to brake those bones
Now brothers and sisters load your guns
Hey Bang that fucking head
Hold fast  And Thrash
Until you're dead
Ugly as a warwound
Thrash like a maniac
This metal will break bones
Hear the call of the Thrashiac
Drilling your skull like a hammer
Stark raving mad on the prowl
We are the final few kicking like a mule
Like a can of worms  Dirtbag and proud
All you thrashers in the back
Are you ready to attack
Hey Bang that fucking head
Hold fast  And Thrash
Now break that neck
Ugly as a warwound
Thrash like a maniac
This metal will break bones
Hear the call of the Thrashiac
Call for the keelhauling
Bleeding those ears
No you have seen nothing yet
Like a thousand tons of led and stone
Banging on your cranium
For fuck's sake  It's Metal to the bone
Oh Come on speed metal legions
Hear the noise of that chainsaw voice
Steel dawn
Come morning  Come death
Always forward  Never back
Like a sniper at the gate of Hell
Rising out of the black
Dawn campaign  Dawn campaign
Like the wolf rushes in
Crawling in to the warzone
Feel the flamer's kiss
Running with the Hellhounds
Up on FlamethrowerRidge
Here's no rules of engagement
Feel the copper taste of fear
Necrophilia In the ditches
Violated  Dawn of death is here
Wartorn  Dawn of death is here
It's here  Dawn of death is here
Will of iron
Chained to this ditch
This pain is just weakness leaving my body
Death next to nature
Red dawn in Hell
Time to put them bodies in those graves
Flytrap bodycount rises
Taking point  And rushing forth 
All I saw as I closed my eyes
The endless lines of body bags at home
Fearless in the face of the aggressor
Another clip  Another dawn
With pockets full of fear countless dogtags
Marching out  This last day of our bones
On this last day of our bones
Into the meatgrinder of war
Fuck'no I never signed up for this
Life crawling on broken glass
Whips and claws like sticks and stone
I'll rip out that screeching coffinheart
As the bull's whips are crackin' bone
Now flesh will crawl
Each move's an error
Like an iron claw in a velvet glove
This bitch is terror
Now I shut you up
Hell knows I've tried
She's got a cruel cruel way
With those needles and blades
It is time to let a sleeping dog lie c'mon
Down and out  Dead and gone
Cold blood  Cold comfort 
Unavenged and unsatisfied
Crawling lizardlike across the folds
You're  Under the whip
I'll rid me of you in due course
Naysaying driveling bitch
All lights out  You're under the whip
Dust to dust  It is paydirt time 
Under the whip
Words like bullets  Like sand in my lungs
Bow down  Backs laid bare
Dont touch  Dont think  Dont feel  Dont speak
Or those whipmastersnights will flare
I Say
In the darkness of her firingrange
Endgame  The End of the line
Flayed with whips from the devils grip
Hell followed her two steps behind
Now rip it up
Whipped with wire
You scream like scraping iron nails
Higher and higher
Beating on a dead horse
Fem' Jackal  Shekiller
Like a doubledealing praying mantis
Only bedlam can thrill her
I'll never taste the rotten fruits you offer
Crawl from under the whip
Cunts and inbreeds of this earth
Crawling on your prayerbones
So you think you're wormless huh
Judging from your higher ground
Praise the lord and pass the ammo
You swarm across this world like plagues
Amen to the ministry of the devilish agenda
Brownnosing priests and popes in every way
Keeling over  Gunports open
Crawling on your ship of rats
As the spiritual migraine hammers
We have nothing in common you and I
Bring out the bloodhounds you've learned nothing
Its open hunting season on this scum
Praying for utopian absolution
Like inbred mongrel dogs
Drag them through the streets
Never free from this disease
Like boneless meat
We're dragging the priests
Prayers coming through as ghastly rattles
Chewing on the ribcage of this earth
In this temple of delinquent mad correction
Drag them to the altarseats to burn
In an ever instant self deceiving brilliance 
Like flies drawn to shit  rotten meat
Words and thoughts fossilizing as you speak
Like multiheaded worms
Contaminated insideout
Redemption reverie
I'll never yield I'll never see  No Never
Infesting on your own young
Eat the gun and pray it's swift
Death penalty is not enough
It's time to right the wrongs  Forever
These feeble words off whom you speak
I'm tired of this shit
Pious fucking lunatics 
 I'll never heed I'll never kneel  Never
Stench of churches burning
Coming back to town
Wipe away the wormshit
Drive away this weakness now  Forever
Words of rape from the prayer factories
This virus sacrament is all you'll ever need
Mindwiped and brainraped  The antisense in flesh
ooah I can't take it anymore

Just know our words won't suffocate you now
Was it
You are a plague
You are a slave
You're a fucking plague
You never said a word
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
You're not a man you're a coward
You hide behind walls of lies
You're such a fucking coward
Devil with the angel eyes
You are the devil with the angel eyes
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
You're not a man you're a coward
You hide behind walls of lies
You're such a fucking coward
Devil with the angel eyes
You're reaping what you've sown
Softly spoken contradictions infiltrate my ears
Piece by piece we tore ourselves apart
Stitch me up but you can't hide the scars
This is how it has to be
See the truth from the lies
Of a dream
Even after we fall apart
Those words are ringing inside my head
Even after we fall apart
Even after we're finally dead
As we marched toward autumn the carousel begins
Riding on butterflies wings our structure rose
We climbed reaching the sky higher and higher
In the face of collapse we breathe the end
On the precipice of change
Change and regression
We are left with nothing with nothing more
As we follow life is hollow
Moving backwards downward spiral
Open me up tongue my weakness
Water boils blackness swallows
As the promises washed away
The time has come to say goodbye
The time has come
Backs to the wall
Our frailty becomes our history
In the face of collapse we breathe the end
On the precipice of change
Change and regression
We are left with nothing with nothing more
As we follow life is hollow
Moving backwards downward spiral
Open me up tongue my weakness
Water boils blackness swallows
Now the time has come for me to let it all go
Don't run for the exits
We're all trapped inside
We set this world on fire
We'll be burned alive
Just like a slaughter house
We're marching single file down a rode
paved with the sins of the past
There is no coming back
We tore this world apart
We dug our own graves
In the end of days there will be no season
Go ahead and pray for your salvation
We tore this world apart
And our time is running out
In the valley of locust there will be no God
In the valley of locust there will be no God
No God to save you
Ignorance breeds ignorants
Are we moving in circles
We must we must wake up
Will we will we survive
We are the cancer of the earth
In the valley of locust there will be no God
In the valley of locust there will be no God
No God to save you
If you still question that
Are you blind or did you close your eyes
In the valley of locust there will be no God
In the valley of locust there will be no God
No God to save us all
From the mouth of hell they rise
from the ground
the day i angle no more angel
for no beggars try to crack a smile
the day the stars will turn to black
all happiness will end up dead

unanswered Q's in my head
scarred forever they drive me mad

bandaged hand in hand
are we going to the same place
both of us enough we got
all the past we carry
NOTHING EVER MATTERS
NO ONE EVEN CARES
GO ON LOUDER
GO ON MOURNING
I DON'T EVEN CARE
bandaged hand in hand
are we going to the same place
we'll be back
from the ground
The end
The songwriter's dead
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
of empathica
of innocence
Empathica
Innocence
The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widow writer torn apart by chains of Hell
One last perfect verse
It's still the same old song
Oh Christ how I hate what I have become
Take me home
Get away run away fly away
Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die I a whore for this cold world
Forgive me
I have but two faces
One for the world
One for God
save me
I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die I a whore for this cold world
Adventurefilled days
One with every smiling face
Please no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right
Take me home
Sparkle my scenery
With Turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The ever free
Tuck me in beneath the blue
Beneath the Pain
Beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby
On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all
I'm afraid I'm so afraid
being raped again and again and again
I know I will die alone
but loved
You live long enough to hear the sounds of guns
Live long enough to see your friends betray you
For years I've been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
a death I always longed for
2nd robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half  infanticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet
Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he`s home in hell serves him well
Slain by the bell tolling for his farewell
The morning dawned upon his altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came
Today in the year of our Lord 2005
Tuomas was called from the cares of the world
He was found naked and dead
Save me
Be still my son
You`re home
Oh when did you become so cold
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love
Search for beauty find your shore
Try to save them all bleed no more
You have such oceans within
In the end I will always love you
The beginning
Finally the hills are without eyes
They are tired of painting a dead man's face
red with their own blood
They used to love having so much to lose
Did you ever hear what I told you
Did you ever read what I wrote you
Did you ever listen to what we played
Did you ever let in what the world said
Did we get this far just to feel your hate
Did we play to become only pawns in the game
How blind can you be don't you see
You chose the long road but we'll be waiting
Bye bye beautiful
Jacob`s ghost for the girl in white
Blindfold for the blind
Dead Siblings walking the dying Earth
Noose around a choking heart
Eternity torn apart
Slow toll now the funeral bells
I need to die to feel alive
Bye bye beautiful
It's not the tree that forsakes the flower
But the flower that forsakes the tree
Someday I`ll learn to love these scars
Still fresh from the redhot blade of your words
How blind can you be don't you see
That the gambler lost all he does not have
Bye bye beautiful
Baptized with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself
War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end little he can do alone
You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give
Caress the one the neverfading
Caress the one the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time we reach
For the ones whoever dare
You believe but what you see
You receive but what you give
Caress the one the neverfading
Caress the one the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Reaching searching for something untouched
Hearing voices of the neverfading calling
Caress the one the neverfading
Caress the one the hiding amaranth
In a land of the daybreak
Running for her life
The dark rain from her eyes still falls
Breathtaking butterfly
Chose a dark day to live
Save one breath for me
A loner longing for
The cadence of her last breath
Why do I miss someone I never met
with bated breath I lay
Sea winds brought her to me
A butterfly mere oneday miracle of life
And all the poetry in the world
Finally makes sense to me
Save one death for me
Put to rest all that`s not life
Drink for beauty and fill my blank page
Sometimes a dream turns into a dream
The cadence of her last breath
Who the hell are you to tell me
What to do why to do why bother
Leech in a mask of virtue
Such waste to ever think of you again
Hey Judas your christens was our love
Hit and run you're be done
Never sorry never wrong
More more more more more
Master Passion Greed
Master Passion Greed
Hello how are you
Let me explain one thing
All for her and more for me
Why is it so hard to see
I see no sense in doing this
Not enough for me
I fuck up everything but let me explain
Some day
Some day you shall flee
Panting and weak
Master Passion Greed
Master Passion Greed
Master Passion Greed
Master Passion Greed
All within me gone but pain and hope
Hoping that the pain will fade away
Greed your master passion
I feed the mouth that bites me
Mammon opiate of the masses
The reek of your lies draws flies
Seek her
Seduce her
Tame her
Blame her
Have her
Kill her
Seek her
Seduce her
Tame her
Blame her
Feast on it all
Seek her
Seduce her
Tame her
Blame her
Have her
Kill her
Seek her
Seduce her
Tame her
Blame her
Feast on it all
With awakening the tears will begin
To my everlasting shame silence took me
630 winter morn
Snow keeps falling silent dawn
A rose by any other name
Eva leaves her Swanbrook home
A kindest heart which always made
Me ashamed of my own
She walks alone but not without her name
Eva flies away
Dreams the world far away
In this cruel children's game
There's no friend to call her name
Eva sails away
Dreams the world far away
The Good in her will be my sunflower field
Mocked by man to depths of shame
Little girl with life ahead
For a memory of one kind word
She would stay among the beasts
Time for one more daring dream
Before her escape
Edenbeam we kill with her own loving heart
A ballad of dark queen echoes through night
One thousand one nights unseen
The philosopher and the queen
Ancient mariner in a sea of sand
The burning beauty his tomb to die for
Horizon`s swarming with death
Run
Heaven has a darkened face
Dunes are soaring as on a chase
Caravan of the cursed
Chasing him across the waves
May he now rest under aegis of mirage
As the sands slowly turn to Elysian fields
One thousand one
One thousand one
One thousand one
One thousand one
We seduce the dark with pain and rapture
Like two ships that pass in the night
You and I  a whore and a bashful sailor
Welcome to a sunrise of a dirty mind
All your love is a lie
You're onenight butterfly
Hurt me be the one
Whoever brings the night
Eyes so bright seductive lies
Crimson masquerade where I merely played my part
Poison dart of desire
Choose a bride tonight
a fantasy for a zombie
Hurt me  I love to suffer
Your harem's a dream for free
Enter
Suck from us and live forever
Rotten beauty
Will haunt you for a lifetime
Come with me under water
And drown to despise me no more
Unholy unworthy
My night is a dream for free
Heaven today is but a way
To a place I once called home
Heart of a child one final sigh
As another love goes cold
blackened below
For the heart I'll never have
For the child forever gone
The music flows because it longs
For the heart I once had
Living today without a way
To understand the weight of the world
Faded and torn old and forlorn
My weak and hoping heart
For the child for the night
For the heart I once had
I believe and foresee
Everything I could ever be
Time will not heal a dead boy's scars
Time will kill
An old man by a sea shore at the end of day
Gazes the horizon with sea winds in his face
Tempesttossed island seasons all the same
Anchorage unpainted and a ship without a name
Sea without a shore for the vanished one unheard
He lightens the beacon light at the end of world
Showing the way lighting hope in their hearts
The ones and their travels homeward from afar
The albatross is flying making him daydream
Princess in the tower children in the fields 
Life gave him it all an island of the universe
Now his love`s a memory a ghost in the fog
Anchor to the water seabed far below
The wolves my love will come
Taking us home where dust once was a man
Is there Life before a Death
Do we long too much and never let in
Howl
Seven days to the wolves
Where will we be when they come
Seven days to the poison
And a place in Heaven
Time drawing near as they come to take us
This is my church of choice
Love`s strength standeth in love`s sacrifice
For the rest I have to say to you
I will dream like the god
And suffer like all the dead children
This is where heroes and cowards part ways
Light the fire feast
Chase the ghost give in
Take the road less traveled by
Leave the city of fools
Turn every poet loose
Heroes cowards no more 
I close my eyes the lantern dies
The scent of awakening wild honey and dew
Childhood games woods and lakes
Streams of silver toys of olden days
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
The flowers of wonder and the hidden treasures
In the meadow of life my acre of Heaven
Sailing the waves of past
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Rocking chair without a dreamer
A wooden swing without laughter
Sandbox without toy soldiers
Yuletide without the flight
Dreambound for life
Flowers wither treasures stay hidden
Until I see the first star of fall
I fall asleep and see it all
Mother's care and colour of the kites
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Meadows of Heaven
Who's there knocking at my window
The owl and the Dead Boy
This night whispers my name
All the dying children
Virgin snow beneath my feet
Painting the world in white
I tread the way and lose myself into a tale
Come hell or high water
My search will go on
Clayborn Voyage without an end
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone bring me back to life
It all starts with a lullaby
Journey homeward bound
A sound of a dolphin calling
Tearing off the mask of man
The tower my sole guide
This is who I am
Escapist paradise seeker
Farewell now time to fly
Out of sight out of time away from all lies
A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light
Come undone bring me back to life
It all starts with a lullaby
Angels of Perdition are rising above
They come from the depths of the realm of death
With them the legions of locusts
They herald the monarchy of hell
Beyond the Black dawn  Resurrection of evil
Beyond the Black dawn  Firestorm breaks out
The Masters of Disease swing their weapons
Gods of Darkness are coming with the storm
In the symbol of the snake they ride
The antagonists of holy creation
Beyond the Black dawn  They will lie to seduce
Beyond the Black dawn  Dragons will rise
The black monster will appear
On a throne made of human bones
His horns are his crown
Carried by the ghouls of the deep
Beyond the Black dawn  Resurrection of evil
Beyond the Black dawn  Firestorm breaks out
Beyond the Black dawn
Beyond the Black dawn
Beyond the Black dawn
Beyond the Black dawn
A mystic full moon shines from the sky
Dark clouds obscure his light
The night of invocation has come
Priests of darkness are gathering
Satanic rituals
In the name of Satan
Satanic rituals
To get closer to hell
The place is surrounded by ancient stones
Those have gathered the energy of evil
In the center burns a black flame
Symbols of darkness are drawn
Satanic rituals
To call the spirits
Satanic rituals
To conjure up the unholy power
They have tasted the flesh of fallen angels
They have tasted the devils black blood
They have seen beyond the world of skin
The architecture of blood and bones and marrow
A mystic full moon shines from the sky
Dark clouds obscure his light
The night of invocation has come
Priests of darkness are gathering
Satanic rituals
In the name of Satan
Satanic rituals
To get closer to hell
To hell
To hell
To hell
The gorge of hell is open
Creatures of darkness rush out
The suffering has begun
They thirst for human flesh
The agony of lust they'll suffer
Their souls shall be damned
The vortex of darkness tears them along
Into the garden of seduction
Awaken by blood
Demons arrive
Awaken by blood
The souls of the dead scream
Awaken by blood
The fires of hell
Awaken by blood
The storms of madness arise
The gorge of hell is open
Creatures of darkness rush out
The suffering has begun
They thirst for human flesh
The agony of lust they'll suffer
Their souls shall be damned
The vortex of darkness tears them along
Into the garden of seduction
Awaken by blood
Demons arrive
Awaken by blood
The souls of the dead scream
Awaken by blood
The fires of hell
Awaken by blood
The storms of madness arise
Awaken by blood
Demons arrive

The souls of the dead scream
Awaken by blood
The fires of hell
Awaken by blood
The storms of madness arise
We are all born to die
In this game called living
The ghost of death raises his claws
And tears apart your energy
The wings of deaths will take your soul
Your body is an empty shell
The wings of death erase your life
You will fly in the night
The wings of death a black bird
The wings of death is your last escort
We are all born to die
Material things have no value
Everyone carries the mark of death
In the abyss of decacy
The wings of deaths will take your soul
Your body is an empty shell
The wings of death erase your life
You will fly in the night
The wings of death a black bird
The wings of death is your last escort
The wings of deaths will take your soul
Your body is an empty shell
The wings of death erase your life
You will fly in the night
The wings of death a black bird
The wings of death is your last escort
The wings of deaths will take your soul
Your body is an empty shell
The wings of death erase your life
You will fly in the night
The wings of death a black bird
The wings of death is your last escort
Unholy voices call his name
The dead will rise again
Demons creep out of the fangs of hell
To seek revenge for Satan
Spirits of dead
Dancing shadows
Children of the night
Strange symbols
Priests of madness
Armies of devils bring perdition
Open the gates of hell
Give birth to the region of evil
Open the gates of hell
Open the door to the underworld
Open the gates of hell
Lightning and thunder are the signs
They sky is soaked in blood
Hades spreads his wings
Legions of darkness Howling wolves
Armies of snakes will kill
Wizards of evil Demon warriors
The bringer of light will appear
Open the gates of hell
Give birth to the region of evil
Open the gates of hell
Open the door to the underworld
Open the gates of hell
Black abyss is opening up
They jump in in ecstasy
The realm of hell will swallow them
A thousand torments they will suffer
Open the gates of hell
Give birth to the region of evil
Open the gates of hell
Open the door to the underworld
Open the gates of hell
Open the gates of hell
Open the gates of hell
Open the gates of hell
Open the gates
It was written in blood
With hands that were possessed
He who traveled between the stars
Got the keys from the great old ones
It was bound in human flesh
At some unknown time
Lies within its demonic writings
It drives its owner into madness
Driven by the gluttony and the power
Because its verses have only one purpose
To conjure up the kingdom of shadows
Dark powers write the book of shadows
It is the legend of the book of death
Demonic rites described in the book of shadows
The key to the underworld the book of death
Hundreds of years it was lost
Hidden by the priests of light
But the order of the silver snake
Now holds it in their hands
Spells of the old priests are lifted
The path to the new world is near
Humans and demons become one
The book of shadows is the gate to hell
Written by the hands of Lucifer
Hidden by the priests of light
The servants of the silver snake
Hold the bidding in their hearts
Dark powers write the book of shadows
It is the legend of the book of death
Demonic rites described in the book of shadows
The key to the underworld the book of death
Dark powers write the book of shadows
It is the legend of the book of death
Demonic rites described in the book of shadows
The key to the underworld the book of death
The chamber of terror
The chamber of fear
Caught in the dark
To infiniteness
Lost in purgatory
In the world of death
Burning for their sins
And no one will save them
The front court to the underworld
Is the gates to hell
But the damned get not allow to enter
Only the pain of the black flames
Burning souls caught forever
Burning souls will scream forever
Burning souls always feel the pain
Burning souls in the twilight of darkness
The chamber of terror
The chamber of fear
Caught in the dark
To infiniteness
In the hour of death
When demons took my soul
There was no tunnel of light
Darkness dragged me further down
The front court to the underworld
Is the gates to hell
But the damned get not allow to enter
Only the pain of the black flames
Burning souls caught forever
Burning souls will scream forever
Burning souls always feel the pain
Burning souls in the twilight of darkness
The front court to the underworld
Is the gates to hell
But the damned get not allow to enter
Only the pain of the black flames
Burning souls caught forever
Burning souls will scream forever
Burning souls always feel the pain
Burning souls in the twilight of darkness
They are the guardians of light
In the temple of the damned
They are possessed by demons
In the shadow of madness
It is the hell's dimension
To rip out your soul
Its hells dimension
They will come to get you
Demoniac dimension
Demoniac dimension
Demoniac dimension
Demoniac dimension
Caught in the flames of damnation
The screams of oppressed souls
Crucified bodies under the sign of Satan
Impaled bodies scream for mercy

To rip out your soul
Its hells dimension
They will come to get you
Demoniac dimension

Am I holding on too tight
It's all I can do
So helpless 
Hear as I'm screaming these words
I can't convey what's  no heard
Live in a lie
Forget all this time
How can you tell me that it's alright 
How can this just be the end
Have we been blind
Hollow inside
I'm falling apart but there's no way to save me 
Hear as I'm screaming these words
I can't convey what's not heard
Live in a lie
Forget all this time 
How can this just be the end
Have we been blind
Hollow inside
I'm falling apart but there's no way to save me 
Why can't you seen in my eyes
That I'm alive
Forget the past
As the memories fade away 
Don't save me
Don't save me 
How can this just be the end
Have we been blind
Hollow inside
I'm falling apart but there's no way to save me 
Why can't  you see in my eyes
That I'm alive
Forget the past
As the memories fade away 
Don't save me fade away

The mark is left on your face
Turned and tossed by the people below
Until you fall in the hole
The crowd pulls you in to the circle pit
Slamming and banging your head

Slamming the posers to death

Not giving a damn who's in your way
Your hearts beating fast as your pitting away

name was Barsaive
And so it was for 500 years
restore it
And this is where the story takes place
in the age of Earthdawn
the Serpent River sing
The distance is far
The Death's Sea lies at my end
I'm crossing the mountains  I'm entering the sea
Lively and free
I'm the serpent  wild and quiet
People pay tribute or feel my might
Helplessly you're floating  darkest destiny
Is ruling thee
But your saviours  they're not far away
Hold on  still you have to stay
Lonely on the Serpent River
Lonely on the raging stream
Lonely on the Serpent River
Lonely Elf you're embraced by me
Now they've reached you
A T'skrang and a man
Finally they saved you
And gave you hope again
Now that I lost thee  I take on my way
As every day
I'm the serpent  creeping trought the land
The Death's Sea lies at my end
Lonely on the Serpent River
Lonely on the raging stream
Lonely on the Serpent River
Lonely Elf you're embraced by me
Dawn has come  soon we will be gone
We face the Blood Woods  the work has to be done
The sun is rising  the jungle's deep
Believing in our hopes that we keep
Passing darkness getting into light
Frightening corpses are entering our sight
Through he seemed but he opened his eyes
Boiling panic let the murder rise
Then we meet you my friend
Bloodbrothers until the end
The oath holds us together
Farewell my friend  forever
told us Ti'An the troubadour
My name is Ti'An  I was a troubadour
Ti'An the Troubadour
A wellhearted man plays no more
His sweet voice fading away
Deep in our hearts  a place to stay
The beasts from Thera have forged an evil plan
To oppress Barsaive and enslave every man
Ti'An the Troubadour
A wellhearted man plays no more
His sweet voice fading away
Deep in our hearts  a place to stay
Hush my friends  it's time  I'm leaving you
Ti'An the Troubadour
A wellhearted man plays no more
His sweet voice fading away
Deep in our hearts  a place to stay
Kaer
There it is  a cave in the ground
Weed is growing out
Seeds of hate are sowed
Death pollutes the air
Dying illusions he must inhabit that Kaer
Dark  dust
In light we trust
Don't you see the darkness you wear
There's a demon in the Kaer
Dark  dust
In light we trust
Don't you see the darkness you wear
There's a demon in the Kaer
Fighting through the hordes of their master
A voice says
Come near faster
Now I feel his unholy breath
Ti'An my friend was tortured till death
Dark  dust
In light we trust
Don't you see the darkness you wear
There's a demon in the Kaer
Dark  dust
In light we trust
Don't you see the darkness you wear
There's a demon in the Kaer
Looking from the Serpent  you can see a town
Gold instead of darkness is shining all around
Golden city  Travar is its name
In the dark hours in here they came
Bringing death and fear with them inside
Many more were killed in their chanceless fight
But still the sun rises and falls
It's a wall of life again in terrific halls
In peoples' hearts burning a glorious flame
In the city of gold  Travar is its name
I reached the gate  paid and walked in
Rush around  I must find him
The book is the key  the end is written
The bard must help me  time is fadin'
Golden city  Travar it is called
Unholy demons came and made a cruel assault
In this bloody fight many lost their lives
Now freedom has returned again
It's warmer and brighter than it was then
Hope has come back  now it will stay
In the city of gold justice has found its way
As I enter the House of the Sun in golden Travar
Golden city  Travar is its name
In the dark hours in here they came
Bringing death and fear with them inside
Many more were killed in their chanceless fight
But still the sun rises and falls
It's a wall of life again in terrific halls
In peoples' hearts burning a glorious flame
In the city of gold  Travar is its name
There's only one street in this city
The golden gate to Throal so pretty
A market where you get everything
Weapons food and things for spelling
Chaos everywhere
Have you ever been there
Where a hero's heart strikes higher
Take care you could deal with a liar
Gamblers playing for money
Bards singing songs like honey
Ships are flying through the air
Crowds of races everywhere
Only once a year
The greatest swordsmen meet here
To find out who's the best
In Barsaive's biggest fighting contest
The home of the traders is called Barterstown
The door to Throal  home of the crown
All this lying to his feet
Where every man gets everything he needs
Hungry and with tired feet
We're looking for a place to sleep
See the last days in our faces
We only need some warm places
The big blue mountains to Throal
Are the target we're heading for
We have to see the king
Got bad news for him to bring
The home of the traders is called Barterstown
The door to Throal  home of the crown
All this lying to his feet
Where every man gets everything he needs
of Throal in the King's hall
The mountains of Throal are his home
He's the one who reigns
The one who wears the crown
The mighty palace built of stone
We have to bring the book
So let's get to the throne
Hail and glory to you  freedom you will bring
Together standing tall in the hall of the king
Banners hanging off the wall
With strongly beating hearts
We enter the King's hall
There you are our mighty king
In honour we kneel down
To the ruler of everything
Hail and glory to you  freedom you will bring
Together standing tall in the hall of the king
Now leave me  the passions are with you
Saviours of the land
You all know what to do
The kingdom is right behind your back
Bring it to an end
And break Iostros' neck
Hail and glory to you  freedom you will bring
Together standing tall in the hall of the king
There's someone who's despising mankind
There's someone here preaching the dark
But no one cares  they're all so blind
Seeking justice we will set a mark
Magic surrounds us
Now that your time has come
Justice is done
We're sent by the light
To turn the black back to white
Don't hail the wrong
Together we're strong
Soon you'll burn
And then the tides will turn
Revenge for all the lives you took
Now faith is coming over you
All your crimes realized by one look
You're guilty  justice will come true
Magic surrounds us
Now that your time has come
Justice is done
We're sent by the light
To turn the black back to white
Don't hail the wrong
Together we're strong
Soon you'll burn
And then the tides will turn
When the dance begins
Magic flows through thee
We feel our bones breaking
But our strength sets us free
Feel the power  taste the steel
Our agony is what you feel
You turn away in hate
Cowardly fleeing through the gate
Now that your time has come
Justice is done
We're sent by the light
To turn the black back to white
Don't hail the wrong
Together we're strong
Soon you'll burn
And then the tides will turn
Now you will see  sadness overwhelms me
Nothing more left to live or to be
Even when you're gone
You will live deep in me
My love still exists
And the wind tells your name
Even when you're gone
The distance is less far
My love still exists
Axandria
I'll miss you
I'll be with you
Forever
How shall I carry on with such a pain inside
Roaming under this wicked sky
Believe me  I know that you do
Even when you're gone
You will live deep in me
My love still exists
And the wind tells your name
Even when you're gone
The distance is less far
My love still exists
Axandria
I'll miss you
I'll be with you
Forever
The art of dying a hymn to the demise of being
Return from yourself the reaper of my fields
Return for you are needed
For the one yet to be born
In the streets the screams are alive
And they will always be
White veils hanging still waiting for you and me
The forest still awaits let us runacross
Return for the morning maybe never
And the breeding is still untouched
Return maybe I fade away
Before the sun but not the stares
They still weep the centuries in your name
For the moon still is what it was
Your name and the closed gate
The horizons sleep in a story
My feelings glare at thee
As their mornings end my mourning begins
My pain is much for you I shall let you breathe
Merge me blend me into sorrow
Shade me with trees of grief
Touch me winds of pain come touch me
Burn me pathos burn me if you can
Now that what I have become
Time is in immortal soils
Sing and dance for my return
Autumn will scream from inside of me
Not a false spring forever please
Times shall change like every thing else
Will you be the same forty seasons from now
Whatever in this world you are going to find
It's going to go and you're going to stay behind
You search for lust or you crave desire
He shall come and take you in fire
Your life will never stay forever
Wait Await thy death
Wait Await thy doom tonight
They cry they weep and pray for mercy
But all they get is a desire of relief
Your waste your life in lust of power
But the one you forget does not forget you
The silence sequel
Wait await your final slumber
Wait for your final destiny
That is your final darkness
That is your final destiny
Lost in the grains of sand
In an hourglass of misfortune
Seperating light from dark dark from light
Day from night Once Again
Alone again
Again I am desolate Again I am left forever
Again I weep in pain
O it's my sigh
It is the sigh I take again
Will this survive Survive to see the daylight
Never shall I
Never shall I again see the sight of the ones
The ones who once left me behind
Fortress Of solitude
Let us merge together
In Solitude For solitude in solitude
My character is now a tragedy
A tragedy forever to be
My existence is now a strain
Slowly it arises the urge
An urge to fly away into the skies of silence
Echoes saying everything fill within
As cold winds rape a lonely tree
And here I sit in somberness
Draped in a thick mist called thought
And grasping me and my imagination
Are these everlasting chains of despair
Waiting for me to again be free
And O how I wish that I could I will
Embrace these skies if time wishes me to
Never again
And the pain persists me
Shall I pay for all I have
Pay for what all was not mine
Indebt me in sorrow
Never shall we be loved
A question will always arise
Fortress Of solitude
Let us merge together
In Solitude For solitude in solitude
I can feel my self to be descanting
Descanting my soul to rise
A vivid expression is seen
And the broken promise shall be
Echoes saying everything fill within
As cold winds rape a lonely tree
Remember
Return
Reverse
Realize
Remember me as fading images
Return to me some other day
Reverse the faces of the pages pale
Realize how the seasons change
How faultless are you and me in our shadow one
As merged forever by a blinding light
Respect the grace that we unleash together
And O how beautiful is my art
As pale as you can think as close as we may be
Relate to all the times
The memories are still black and white
black and white purple gray
And how much more pale will you become
Am I not faded enough for you
Realize how the seasons change
Reverse the faces of the pages pale
Return to me some other day
Remember me as fading images
I might just wait another season for you
The memories are still black and white
Today's emptiness tomorrow's dream
An addiction like never seen
All is still beneath an orange moon
Posed calm with this dreadful civility
This grin
You are a soft crowd pleasure
Your seduction campaign is too bold way too bold
A dusty old institution with a revamped facade
A staged glamorous look to appeal my generation
I have no interest
I really dont care
What are you proud for
It was all given to you
You are just perfect hollow news
Smoke and mirrors
A fairy tale accessible for the masses
A spending spree and a waste of time
Un tunnel une lumiÃÂÃÂ¨re au lointain
La distance qui nous sÃÂÃÂ©pare interminable
Le pourquoi de mon chemin de mes choix
Le pourquoi de mon chemin de mes choix
Jai choisit un travail gratifiant
Jai tout ce dont jai besoin
Je ne ferais que mencombrer dobjets
Je passerais mon temps ÃÂÃÂ  les bouger
Tout y est jai tout fait
Je reste toutefois insatisfaite
En panne de sens je dois marrÃÂÃÂªter
Au sol ÃÂÃÂ  mes pieds rien de la terre
Sa sÃÂÃÂ©duisante simplicitÃÂÃÂ©
Un tunnel une faible lumiÃÂÃÂ¨re au lointain

When we started this band
All we needed needed was a laugh
Years gone by
I'd say we've kicked some ass
When I'm enraged
Or hittin' the stage
Adrenaline rushing
Through my veins
And I'd say we're still kickin' ass
Ooo ahh kickstart my heart
Hope it never stops
And to think we did all of this
To rock
Kickstart my heart
Without you there's no change
My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same
Without you I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl you'd never never know
Without you without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you woman The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you without you
Without you my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
A sailor lost at sea
Without you woman
The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you without you
I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only youas we grow old
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you without you
She's got an alligator bag
Top hat to match
Dressed in black on black
She's got a Philipino girlie
She claims is her friend
I tell you boys you just gotta laugh
Now I used to call her Cindy
She changed her name to Sin
I guess that's the name of her game
I really used to love her
Then the kitty she discovered
It's got to be a sexual thing
All all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same ol' same ol' situation
It's the same ol' same ol' ball and chain
I say no no no
No no no Introduced me to her lover
In a cellophane dress
Then they bid me a sweet fairwell
Last time I saw them
They were kissing so softly
To the sound of wedding bells
All all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same ol' same ol' situation
It's the same ol' same ol' ball and chain
Just like a punch in the teeth
Or a swan dive to the street
No no no
No no no
If it wasn't for bad luck
I'd have no luck at all
When she calls me up
My voice it starts to shake
She says come right over
Over right away
Oh good God there's a fire
In my pants
Then lightning strikes and she
Laughs that evil laugh
She's so sticky
Stick sweet Now when I've done good
She slaps me on the ass
It takes more than ten seconds
To satisfy this lass
The way she walks I swear
Should be a crime
Sirens scream everytime
She walks by
She's so sticky
Stick sweet
Little Miss Muffet
Sweet girl's school stuff and
A country smile and charm
Out in the back
Of my '58 Chevy
She said she'd do me no harm
You know she makes me feel good
Just like a bad girl should
She goes down
She goes down
She goes down
Down down down
Sassy little lassie
Walking right past me
Down in Tennessee
Always a lady
I love Southern ladies
They just know how to please
It's like connecting the dots
She goes down
She goes down
Down down down
All of the day
All of the night
Lick those lips
Do you up right
Up and down
Round and round
Round the world
Scream it out
You know she makes me feel good
C'ya out in Hollywood
Flat on my back she goes down
For backstage pass she goes down
With all of my friends she goes down
She gives heart attack she goes
She goes down
She goes down
She goes down
Down down down
We could sail away
Or catch a freight train
Or a rocketship into outer space
Nothin' left to do
Too many things were said
To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did
Seasons must change
Separate paths separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain
I knew it all along
I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along
That's alright that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright that's okay
Let's turn the page My friends called today
Down from LA
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away
That's alright that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
Thats's alright that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away
That's alright that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright let's turn the page
And remember what I say girl
And it goes this way
Girl don't go away mad
Girl just go away
I heard some kids telling me
How they've lost all the faith in the way
They've been talking world peace
And the wars in the streets
The lines on their faces so deep yeah
A revolution or reach out
And touch the day
We're overdue child
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
I feel the the future
In the hands of our youth
No more lies
Old tired fools tell our future
A revolution or reach out
And touch the day
We're overdue child
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change
I'll change
I'll change
Not tomorrow but today
Change
Now it's time for change
Nothing stays the same
Now it's time for change

Far away see the sign see the light in the sky
In the valley of kingdom

Hear the silence of courageous souls
Resting forever
All the warriors are marching

For freedom they're longing for
Until the day their time will come
High and higher let's ride
Let's ride up high high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away far away

The light in the sky
Let's fly up high high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away far away
See the light see the light
The shine in the night
In the line of fire
They keep their steel up high
Under the rays of the blazing sun
Controlled by an electric eye
At the end of the ocean
Over the top of the hills
Where the rivers of destiny
Flow in the lake of eternity
High and higher let's fly
Let's ride up high high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away far away
See the sign see the sign
The light in the sky
Let's fly up high high over the rainbow
Far beyond
Over seven seas
Far away far away
See the light see the light
The shine in the night
Let's ride on the rainbow over seven seas
On the screen he's playing along
Doesn't know what's right or wrong
On the edge to the dark danger zone
He turns on the start to obsession
The evil casts a spell inside
Doesn't know what's wrong or right
Like Doctor Jekyll or else Mr Hide
War craft game of fear
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes the endless dream remains
The evil casts a spell inside
Doesn't know what's wrong or right
Ain't Doctor Jekyll nor even Mr Hide
War craft game of fear
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes the endless dream remains
War craft dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes the endless dream remains
Once again 
Once again the frantic thrill remains
War craft game of fear
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Lord's prayers disappear
Annihilate the racketeer
Close your eyes the endless dream remains
Dress you up in killer gear
And the silence never ends
Annihilate the racketeers
Close your eyes the endless dream remains

Another night another unholy breed
Another soul is twisting in agony
A widow's praying to the gods of salvation again
Welcome into the heart of darkness my son
We are rising to a challenge
And at nightfall it begins
Relieve her of her majesty
And be the chosen one
See the sign the cosmic energy
Leads your way along the path of fame
Shades disappear a soul full of pride
For nemesis we'll die
See the sign holy prophecy
free the world terra liberty
Beyond all the fear hearts will be strong
for the terra liberty
The crystal mountains reflect your silhouette
may your courage break the spell of the damned
In the tower she is lost
Trapped in a cage of stone
Relieve her of her majesty
and be the chosen one
See the sign the cosmic energy
Leads your way along the path of fame
Shades disappear a soul full of pride
For nemesis we'll die
See the sign holy prophecy
free the world terra liberty
Beyond all the fear hearts will be strong
for the terra liberty
And when the night comes
I can feel the wind so cold
The battle has begun
and I can hear the screams of war
for terra liberty
See the sign the cosmic energy
Leads your way along the path of fame
Shades disappear a soul full of pride
For nemesis we'll die
See the sign holy prophecy
free the world terra liberty
Beyond all the fear hearts will be strong
for the terra liberty
I I'm on my way back there's no regret
There's no appreciation
I I lost all my faith it's killing the blaze
Erases the flame of glory
Wait we wait for a sign longing for life
It's time to ride we're riding the sky
There's no need to cry
Flying free like and eagle
On the way to eternity
No more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain
I I fell of the track dropped of the edge
by a slam of my self damnation
I I'm taking the blame but memories remain
Raising the lust for living
Wait we wait for a sign longing for life
It's time to ride we're riding the sky
There's no need to cry
Flying free like and eagle
On the way to eternity
No more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody's gonna get a flame inside
Everybody needs somebody
Everybody's gonna get a flame inside
Flying free like and eagle
On the way to eternity
No more cry no more reason
to forget all the endless pain
Flying free like and eagle
Spread your wings and glide away
Live your dream live forever
United in harmony
A contest of our lost illusions
troopers side by side
recruited for the cyber war craft
A game you're playing all the night
Never surrender don't cry try to survive
You've always been a gambler in life
Charge your power never hide
Imagine the victory is near
ardent we fight  to get a second life
Any time anywhere in a virtual universe
Sometimes somewhere
space legends are marching on
Don't be afraid of strangers
it's just a fictious scene
A battlefield of bits and bytes
Enemies on screen
Imagine the victory is near
ardent we fight  to get a second life
Any time anywhere in a virtual universe
Sometimes somewhere space legends space legends
Any time anywhere a strange and crazy world
Sometime somewhere
space legends will be marching on
Life in cyber galaxy
The final cyber call
Any time anywhere in a virtual universe
Sometimes somewhere space legends space legends
Any time anywhere a strange and crazy world
Sometime somewhere
space legends will be marching on
Can't wait for the time to come together
No sleep at night say now or never

Times were hard without you by my side
showing me the wrong path from the right
Guiding me showing me the way
Always glowing inside forever and a day
I will burn each part of my soul
just to feel your warmness in this cold
Shivering my fingers touched your hands
No sign of life I didn't understand
Guiding me showing me the way
Always glowing inside forever and a day
I will burn each part of my soul
just to feel your warmness in this cold
Shivering my fingers touched your hands
No sign of life I didn't understand
Crossing the desert alone
the endless bright oceans of sand
No walls and no borders on sight
Seeking the truth
Inside my soul silent mourns
Blind my mind inside my heart
tempests of sorrows drown my faith
Went into the wild merciless place in my mind
Where I had to find some kind of peace inside
Wounds of the past would they ever be healed
Can you stop the pain and the ache
Better tomorrows never to come
Bloody distant screams seeking the truth
Desert was silent and I was on my way home
The soft wind of night was tickling my face
made me feel alright erased all my trace
The wind start to harshen I see a wall of sand
A tempest was marching covering the land
The wrath of the Sahara was eating me alive
Unleashed all its power the elements on strife
I beg for my life
the demons took over my mind
The mighty sands just spared my life
I saw the tempest from inside
The desert spirit was with me
No chance to run no way to hide
it smiles to me and set me free
Carrying more than I can stand
falling into the abyss
Passing out losing grip
losing my faith lost the battle
Lost my soul by the way
Here's my judgement
I lived a life full of regrets
My disbelief the hate and loneliness
consumed my soul from deep inside
I slowly lost my reason and my mind
and fell into the madness
Waiting for my day to come
Longing for eternal peace
Stop the battle close my eyes for eternity
Madness
Desperate when I was on my own
Then you came like in my dreams
Tenderly your whispers echoed in my heart
Which I thought dead
With you I'm feeling warm
I'm alive when you hold my hand
Hold my hand and get me out
From that hole I the dark
Let me see that gleam of light
Let it shine on my heart
Lost in the dark with my fears
No stars above no one to love
Tears comes run down my face
And they fade as they fall
I heard your call called my name
To hold my hand bring me back to life
Yes now I'm alive back to the real world
Now I'm feeling better
When you're by my side I don't need to hide
I reached the bottom you brought me back
When I was drowning you were in my mind
Oh oh
I feel the fever Inside my soul
Burning desire deep inside my heart
Now try to breathe just find some space
You are my last chance my only way out
Oh oh
When you talk to mewhen you hold my hand
Hold my hand and get me out
From that hole I the dark
Let me see that gleam of light
Let it shine on my heart
Deep breath and sweet whispers
burning passion bursting from your lips
A deadly addiction
No I never thought that blaze could fade
But I just can't forgive
Suffering every minute every moment every night
Take away all the memories with you
No more rain let the sun rise let the world be
So take away all the memories with you
All with you All with you
Sweet bitter memories you left behind
Does it really matter now that I no longer care
So let it go because I did not know
that your heart was made of stone
How did I believe your lies
How I drowned my soul into your eyes
Take away all the memories with you
No more rain let the sun rise let the world be
So take away all the memories with you
All with you All with you
I'm feeling anger
Run within my veins
For the ones who died
lost their lives in vain
Pain ain't no hope no more
misery is spreading faster
fallen angels cry
Blood tears and sorrows
The lonely nights spent on the front
Made me blind to all the pain around
Brave soldiers fall for no cause at all
Mighty blood quenching a thirsty ground
Soldiers fight to death
Showing blind obedience
suffering martyrdom
Tell me how could we
Pretend to build the peace
Brothers can't you see
That war is all there is
They're telling lies
Closing their eyes
Who pays the price
With their own lives
Dirty deeds that I have to forget
No turning back
Now my choices I have made
Standing tall I will not be afraid
Those things I left behind
like the dust swept by the wind
Could I stand with no fear
Even though it might be hard
Life is a game you can always play until you die
I won't give up I'll carry on and fight
Believe in my faith survive the deepest dark
My regrets are now all gone no more despair
I think that now I'm freed I finally see the end
Those things I left behind
like the dust swept by the wind
Could I stand with no fear
Even though it might be hard
Life is a game you can always play until you die
I won't give up I'll carry on and fight
Believe in my faith survive the deepest dark
Don't you see the red rain is falling down on us
The pain and hate always rise where is the trust
I'm living in this empty world
It's like a dead man  nothing works
Why so many tears have had to fall
don't you know I'm tired of it all
Our wishes and bloody hopes everything is burned
And to the Lord I want to return
My eyes are so tired because of what I've seen
Why so many tears have had to fall
don't you know I'm tired of it all
So take me to another world
where there are only white birds
I flew when the planes were safe
I cried happy tears in happy days
I left all the crises and the wars
my heart is tired now
It's closing its doors
And I walked on the golden sand
when the sky was so beautiful
I remember the first kiss
the son and wife whom I miss
First words I wrote on a candlelight
and the letters I read through the night
It's like a shockwave to your brain
A voice that makes you go insane
You feel that fire in your eyes
no more chains and no more ties
That freedom running in your vain
under the pressure and the pain
You're getting just as cold as ice
Like you'd get 7 with one dice
When you're feeling wild immature as a child
Feel like an atomic bomb
From the cradle to the tomb
From the desert to the pole
Just let there be rock 'n roll
Even when you're feeling low
in the worst days that you might know
Try to pick up your guitar
Raise the volume to the stars
When you're feeling wild immature as a child
now hear our community's words
from northern side of this earth
words about your curse
We want this to be heard
what we now have learned
We bring this to you now
when northwind blows
This message full of darkness
but you'll see it was the truth
on day of your doom
You want this to remain
world of endless pain
Ocean of fire shall blaze
from desire of evilness
in land of hope
New king shall rise from there
New king share rise from there
You want this to remain
world of endless pain
Children in hunger
Fathers fighting in unholy war of evil
end of wordly glory
Hear those whispers from above
our bell has begin to toll
creed has twisted in our sanity
we all shall bury ourselfs in the sand of lies
seeds of emptiness we are
so mortal souls we are
see now what we have become
hope that we won't live forever
silence is here to stay
but that's what we need in our impurity
we are welcome to end
this is the sign for humanity
The end
The end
Cold hand is stretching
to the portal of destiny
dark dimension shall clarify
the conception of mortal one
line between two worlds
pain and irrevocable
from deep shall found oblivion
eternal unknown
how short is the bridge
between two worlds
how is mind calling
for cold death
line between two worlds
pain and irrevocable
from deep shall found oblivion
eternal unknown
sleeping in cradle of white lake
child of oblivion
northern wind is closing the bridge slowly
When light no longer rose to kiss me
I swore to tear Heaven asunder
As flights of fallen angels wished me
Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder
Eclipsing violent centuries
Like a dark scar over France
Enter the nascent Gilles de Rais
A warrior and a scholar
He fought for Joan Of Arc
Before she met with martyrdom in flames
Far from fairytale
A deathshead on his sail
A light that would not fail
Beneath her spell
But the crucifix was veiled
When his decadence prevailed
In a drench of red regaled
He was shat out of Hell
Shat out of Hell
Frozen in iniquity
A passion for awe in an age of grief
His wealth and power led him on
To the tainted gates of Babylon
Born beneath the howling stars
In a shower of golden Lys
A wolfcub with the world between his sabre teeth
Torn between extremes of faith
The pious and the priests
Far from fairytale
The coffin and the nail
Descending to the pale
Under the spell
Of alchemists who failed
To clench the menstrual grail
In a drench of red regaled
He was shat out of Hell
Shat out of Hell
Grown so morbid without war
The wine corrupted nightmares spored
His Lord's betrayal played no more
He beat upon the Devil's door
Demanding pleasures to replace
Joan Of Arc her epic grace
Had set aflame his wolfheart with her truth
And when she died his life of pride
Was lost to God and in his crimes
He turned to raising Satan with the proof
Soon nightly unsightly
Offerings were made on a vulgar altar
And slowly but surely
The darkness answered like a falling star
Far from fairytale
Insanity exhaled
A fullblown winter gale
Under it's spell
Innocents assailed
Were entered and impaled
In a drench of red regaled
He was shat out of Hell
Shat out of Hell
Perverse seductive cruel as sin
An egotist he mourned
Both war and glory schooled to win
Whatever bored imagination spawned
Her penultimate sighs
Called softy on the kindling wind
And then a golden flash like the onset of Heaven
Leaving her screams breaking my heart
And in the grip of fire
I knew the death of love
Where will you be when they tense for warfare
What will you see with your innocence there
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they tense for warfare
Where will you be when God is glorifying
There we will be between the dead and dying
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when God is glorifying
Prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain
Devoted to the votive holy standard above
'By command of the king of Heaven'
Came the death of love
Where will you be when they're vilifying
How will they see when the truth is blinding
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they're vilifying
Where will you be when the dark is rising
How will you keep from it's terrorizing
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when the dark is rising
Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
But visions and ambition
Never listened to submission
And she was on a mission from the highest above
To Lord upon the slaughter
Like a sword through hissing water
She arose where archers sought her
For the death of love
The righteous death of love
Gilles adored her drama
Her suit of pure white armour
Blazed against the English in a torrent of light
And as they rallied onto night
A cancer fled his soul
Dissolving
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame a Valkyrie
She made him click without desire
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when they caught her breath
Her words would leave a scar
'For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars'
How will you know if the sky is burning
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when Babel builds my fire
Will you not flee and label me pariah
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they light my pyre
Aligned with Joan in all
That was enthroned and divine
He swore to score the crimes
Jackdaws poured on this dove
Crimes he knew alone
Derived from minds of the blind
The church unfurled for murder perched
Upon the death of love
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame a Valkyrie
She claimed the skies were lit with spires
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when she fought for breath
Her words would leave a scar
'For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars'
Oh how my rampant desire
Ripped from the presence of God
Now hungered like a beast
For the knowledge of evil
When Joan was burnt
He knew malevolence
At the heart of all
A cold and jagged abyss bled of sense
The throne he earned
Through God's benevolence
Started his own fall
Clothing ragged dogma in his own magnificence
Here the stench the gold events
The bold inventions of the will
Every wanton bent desire went fulfilled
A Daemon sat upon the top of the world
Like a Herod over Genesis
They sang hosannas as his banners unfurled
Kissing terrors with paralysis
His brash canvas insulted the view
moving heaven and earth to please the
Tumultitudes whom his strange retinue drew
To assert the thirteenth Caesar
The thirteenth Caesar
Ichor kicked inside his veins
The thirteenth Caesar
War was licked for shame
The thirteenth Caesar
Sicker but just as vain
The thirteenth Caesar
Gilles De Rais
When Joan was burnt
He knew malevolence
At the heart of all
He swore henceforth he would serve evil alone
Here the stench the gold events
The insurrection of his will
Theatre and feasts past the ken of mortal men
Every wanton bent desire went fulfilled
A Daemon sat upon the top of the world
Like a Herod over genesis
They sang hosannas as his banners unfurled
Striking terror intro menaces
Suetonius and Ovid
Filled the moonstruck dreams
With the purple of Rome
His Venus of arenablood was dead
And he was storming home
God can deny nothing to a De Rais
And should He ever
There is always the Devil
Here sat Babylon
Fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
Where the decadent tastes of Hell grew strong
Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom
Dusk descended like a final curtain
On this stage only death was certain
Singing through the turrets
Like a velvet serenade
Played near a grave
Sentries and gentry afforded the bloom
Of a red setting sun and a bloodletting moon
Applauded then accorded them
Portents of doom
Almost too soon
They pissed upon the winds
That rocked the cradles
Laughing over those hovels grovelling to wolves
They kissed and sinned
Under overstocked tables
As the world outside grew sodden and mauled
Here sat Babylon
Fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
Where the decadent tastes of Hell grew strong
Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom
Gilles sat sipping damson absinthe
From a goblet made of bone
As lightning ripped and danced upon
The flagstones
Wayward fantasies marched on home
Now the treetops bowed to whisper
In a thin Disney veneer
They knew the howls so exquisitely honed
Were those of children disappeared
They'd listened to the winds
Heard the murdered Abel
Rechristened in the stone jaws of Tiffauges
Where the list of sins
Grew beyond a fable
They now roared abroad restless with debauch
Restless with debauch
Restless with debauch
This tragic kingdom
Would see God's angels walk
Away
Satanic enigmatic
His black magic was ecstatic
Megalomaniac in titanic displays
Dressed in the best
Wicked britches of the West
He cut a mourning figure in glorious swathe
But all his nightmares would come true
Drowning in a stream of conscious pleasure
Here sat Babylon
Fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
Where the decadent tastes of Hell grew strong
Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom
Like a curse upon
This tragic kingdom
The moon bleared through the skeletal trees
Averting her face from congenital deeds
Thus eves grew murky haunted grieved
About this place laced with demon seed
Blanchet a priest his book of lies
Exonerated him from Gilles' crimes
Announced his fears one night of sighs
A night for cursing nursery rhymes
The track gets blacker for this tragic kingdom
Gilles' frightening wealth his tightening grip
Steered to near ruin in successive years
Of the most of excess and the best of it here
I conjure you Barron Satan Beelzebub
By the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit
By the Virgin Mary and all the saints
To appear in person so that you may speak to us
And fulfill our desires
Come at my bidding and I will grant you
Whatever you want however vile
And the curtailing of my life
He would rise triumphant
All done up
On a plume of raven wings
Trafficking with sycophants
Sharing his cup
Amidst other graver things
Alchemists and sorcerers stitched his head
With the stench of pitch and myrrh
The devout faded out but the pagan remained
The candles burnt low and still nothing came
He would have his demon
He would have his vice
All save his soul was up for sacrifice
Despite their raising not a single hair
Everything stank of witchcraft there
From the stained chapel to the statued lawn
In Caprineum on the lake
To the still lit crypts and the slit of dawn
Sliding down the towers it all smelt fake
He needed answers not advice
Intending to devise
A lengthy train of torture for the fool
Who thought a seance would suffice
Or sighted furred in dragonflies
The signature of Satan on a wall
Sweetest Maleficia
Planchette to Blanchet from ghosts to a priest
Returning with a spider for the poisonous feast
The Italian astrologer Prelati spinning sin
His fingertips were scented with
The tears from seraphim cheeks
Part glamour and a hammer
Cadaverous and glib
Commanding in a voice of frozen peaks
He would have his demon
He would have his gold
Out of control Gilles' soul was sold
Under mistletoe and the glistening snow
Kissing in the shadow of abandoned saviours
From the banquet hall to the stable gates
A graveyard shift in tone
Sank upon the castle like a papal weight
Or a deep philosophical stone
The air was sick with trepidation
Despair and desperation
Then he fixed his covenant in blood
Now all was rich and tapestried
Fragrant wine to shitty mead
His new world opened with a claret flood
Time was right this wretched night
To etch the circles clear again
So too Prelati brought the dark
It's name was Barron eyes like catastrophic tar
Imbibed with fire
Entangled in a dream
The mirrors full of steam
His last attempt to grasp at God
Lay blackened in a holy fog
And now there were only devils to pursue
Gilles was wrapped in a velvet spell
Of Hell and her seductions
The assassinated days as a Caesar gone by
Barron spitting acid as his magical guide
Sweetest Maleficia
So potent was the star under which I was born
That I have done no one in the world has done
Nor can ever do
Praeclarum
Custodem
Ovium
Lupum
All Saints Day the taint of rain
Blood and mud and thunder all the same
To those who close their ranks to Gille's men
Bricqueville Prelati and De Sille
Brittle angels out to pasture once again
Torture garden rules of thumb apply
To sacred flesh and the naked eye
Golgothic this erotica
Stinking of honey and worse sulphur
So black was the magic in this tragical kingdom
That the superstitions grew
Wise to the wolves that surprised their children
Gagged in sacks and dragged back to
Tiffauges
It's roads now home to a beautiful stranger
Lifting her veil
Spinning her lies
Tender eyes neverending danger
It grows
A rose that chose death for it's bedmuck
Prickles in wait
Thanking her spies
Trickling thighs her only hiccup
And though she walks the forest trails
She's far from innocent or frail
That night is rife with celebration
The tower sings
Where so much foul illumination
Strikes a lighthouse for the things
Mid sour dreams
A beauty pageant for the gathering damned
Of slaughtered lambs and tortured screams
Praeclarum
Custodem
Ovium
Lupum
Torture garden rules of thumb apply
To sacred flesh and the naked eye
Golgothic this erotica
Stinking of honey and worse sulphur
So black was the magic in this tragical kingdom
In this castle of loupgarou
When moonstruck veins inflamed deranged on
A parcel of victims now tied to
Tiffauges
Engorged on the hordes of the anorexic
Cherubim forced
Naked and blind
A holocaust mind designed their exit
A libertine so grim
Sometimes tore them limb from limb
Slitting their throats
Pissing on graves
Jesus saved but the devil made him
Praeclarum
Custodem
Ovium
Lupum
Sometimes I beheaded them
with daggers with poniards with knives
Sometimes I suspended them in my room
And when they were languishing
I committed with them the evils of the flesh
The evening air laps thick about
The stagnant moat that Tiffauges claims
As dusk now slips away
Where taught to run the rotten tongue
Of a hotter GÃÂÃÂ¶tterdÃÂÃÂ¤merung
Has started licking like a flame
Whispers in the dismal mist
Are full of crystal promises
Black rites begun in earnest
Ignite Hell's hungry furnace
Behold the bold inauguration of the darkside
Demonic passions climbing
Illfated stars aligning
The tide of blood is rising
His gifts will be providing
Unmasked the phantom lord De Rais
Haunts the furthest tower
Wherein death has sucked the hour
There throttled gasps tantamount to foreplay
And drooling razors next to come
Unspool red secrets from the young
The moon grinned full the games were chaste
When the children first arrived
Now midnight shadows crawl apace
To darken counsel with their lives
Flesh and ecstasy as sport
Are immortal vices of the highest order
Wherein devilry holds sway
Their songs of Necronomicon
Spoke out of Gilles De Rais
Each murdered son each frozen rose
Handpicked was gently fed
To the sumptuous one in black and those
Whose lives were thrown in with the dead
The candles lit the stage was set
As it was in sainted days
When censers swung and banners hung
On the Siege of Orleans on the painted Seine
Now the castle floats in the drifting fog
Torn from it's moorings
Like a shipwreck dredged from Hell
As innocents entreat a shifting God
Their voices soaring
On a silver tide to heaven
On a knife edge as they fell
The blade would plunge in virulent arcs
Such wounds would stretch away
By the fireside warmed to creative sparks
Of the monster Gilles De Rais
Gilded Gilles De Rais
Comets vomited
The restless bells of crime
Peeled back skin from broken bones
Of angels cut from the nicks of time
Festering faces with painted eyes
The prettiest kept to be thrust inside
Gaping necromantic from the mantleside
Caked in kissed goodbyes
Days faded in decay
The stench of perfume lied
No horror in the glades of man
Was left for Barron to provide
So unique was the beat of his poisoned heart
And it's sordid morbid crack
No further atrocity could possibly surpass
Unrewarded bored he turned his back
Something thicker than despair
Rides upon the midnight air
The smell of blood the taste of prey
We spy you hiding Gilles de Rais
Under August swelter
After banquet and soiree
When spiced wine and song
Have further heated veins
To the ninth degree as tenacula
Hold another body in their sway
Gilles retires from the grasping fires
That will ashen the remains
Darkness incarnate
Demons in his semen
That once clung about the throats
Of children dragged from cellars to his rooms
Now permeate the castle
All who sleep dream of the goat
That dark eclectic harbinger of doom
Nightingales sang of tragedy
Whispers were made of blasphemy
Vain insane this brute aloof
Drew tainted veils over bitter truth
The stairs ran helterskelter
His bedchamber besieged
By phantoms who sheltered
In it's furs remorse
Sought to overwhelm him
Like a lantern of disease
That shone on rotten faces
Of those murdered out in force
Darkness incarnate
Fleeing ghosts so indisposed
To his Satanic love
Of children dragged from cellars to his feast
He rose a carnal wind opposed
To those that sat above
Tearing out into the forest like a beast
The night wind sang of tragedy
Whispers were made of blasphemy
Vain insane this brute aloof
Drew tainted sails over naked truth
Madness clouded everything
Like a lycanthropic shroud
And through it's ghastly lineaments he saw
The trees become obscenities
Semen drip from every bough
As if he rooted Nature like a whore
Dryads tongued under skirts of leaves
Surrendering branches that slenderly pleased
The Mocking orifices and the forest on her knees
Then once besotted knotted trunks now grew
Rotten venereal cancerous blue
Death is only a matter of a little pain
Beneath the sallow moonlight
In a wonderland of pain
Gilles fled back to the castle
Terrified and drained
He sought his deep red velvet bed
And the sleep it preordained
Exhausted forced into the dead
The creep of nightmares came again
Madness clouded everything
Like a lycanthropic shroud
And through it's ghastly lineaments he saw
Hundreds of slain children
Some came crawling disembowelled
To where he stretched out howling on all fours
Corpses tore at his legs and knees
As he clawed to the cross begging reprieve
From a Lord that soared above the awful scene
He sobbed and wept no voice was left
To scream the dream was not drubbed yet
He heard the horrors hiss beside him
'Herod you'll regret'
'Who hears the tears of nightfall
Who steers the spears so spiteful'
Oh my dearest angels go pray to God for me
Awaking in a sweat
Forsaking pleasure for regret
Another night of blight had slowly passed
The morning skies once fresh and bright
Darkened down no near twilight
Gilles wandered as in purgatory
Beyond the grave of his estate
Neither Heaven Hell or peasantry
Were present save projected hatred
He knew suspicion he felt derision
And grief like a sharpened stake
Pierce his heart and now the start
Of his unknitting began to take
Vain glorious a Lord devout
He thought his soul exempt
From guilt and doubt there's no way out
Ten leagues beneath contempt
He drank an ocean quoting Joan the maiden
A vampire's pious rant
His hot blood stank of devotion laden
With bias for love's covenant
Awaking in a sweat
Forsaking pleasure for regret
His choired chapel sighed with his laments
As accusations reached a roar
Investigations breached the door
He put up nothing save his favours in defense
The Church stirred in it's Roman lair
The grease had long been spent
Now all tongues spat at Tiffauges there
Ten leagues beneath contempt
Just one falter
One misplaced deed
And Gilles would be undone
As he teetered on the verge of defeat
Profaning God's altar
Bursting in on evening Mass
He threatened there to crucify the priest
Drunk on fiery wine
With the storm lashing behind
He then threw this Philistine
To his foulest dungeon
And money owed or not
The Priest released or left to rot
His blatant sacrilege begot
A war machine of papal Rome
They came for him in mourning splendour
With the blessing of the Saints
His fawning grin in sweet surrender
A lesson in enforced restraint
He knew suspicion he felt derision
And fear like a sharpened stake
Pierce his heart and now the start
Of his unknitting began to take
He thought courts bought with golden crowns
Rich Bishops he could tempt
But traitor's gate was sought and found
Ten leagues beneath contempt
Ten leagues beneath contempt
This is the moment I go to God
Burning like derision on the prism of night
Meant to overpower and bedizen his light
The moon was black
Devil may care
Three times he'd glared before his judges
Darkening there
With a Wormwood mind
And a gullet of poison
Asked
He thought the court a farce
His tongue as sharp as glass
A bastard to the last
This truth assassin
tautened his claws at the ruinous cast
Flexing vexation at clerics aghast
In uproar he caused the cross to be masked
And the hex of exile from God's Kingdom passed
Back in the mirror shattered vanity died
The curse even clearer on the sanity side
Banished from the lavish tracts of paradise
From Heaven's shored poured to the sore divide
The moon was black
Devil may care
Their thunder sundered all his veils
Thickening there
His beligerent pulse
To a sickening crawl
Yes
He'd fostered wickedness
Fed vipers at his breast
Inflicted death's caress
So now to suffer
He'd burn discern
That his second turn
Would last for eternity
In reckoning flames
O'er a rainbow of black magic scars
Deep in the sleep of this heretic barred
The nightmares were livid occultist depraved
His epiphany struggled to come
But dawn found him there redemptive prepared
Like Christ to Golgotha his face to the sun
All fears were smeared
When Joan had appeared
In a shower of tears
Last vestige of innocence
Yearning for her vision of divinity
Of her miracles and dreamt lyrical deeds
He would meet her at the pyre as the fire kissed
Devil may care
He awed the court with a sworn confession
Quickening there
His radiant death
And acute renewal
Thus
The end was glorious
He went like Jesus trussed
To shadow and to dust
At the stroke of seven
And
With thieves at both his hands
The Reaper of these lands
Wept with holy plans
As he choked to heaven
I am redeemable and I believe
The clemencies of God
And suffrages of the Holy Church
Have succoured me with much mercy
I have only ever wished to satisfy my desires
Worming through the mark
Of Ezekiel and Mark
Through the chapters of Honorius
Gilles as in a trance
Screwed the pages up and danced
Courting something vainly glorious
He walked he gravest night
That decrepit final juncture
Of doom and negativity
Reeking of death
And the gloom of Stygian light
When suddenly the faintest whisper
A curtain opened in a painted vista
Moonbeams swept into his dream
Balsamic and anathema
Balsamic and anathema
Prelati full of stars
Magical ecstatic stars
That sparkled no debacle sought to douse
His fiery omnipresence
Hissed at heaven evanescent
He was there to thwart the burning of his Faust
The gates were prised the phantom horses
Snorted restless to be gone
With enchantment's eyes upon the door he cried
'Come with me now'
Gilles balked the thought of life
Accused and pursued
And overridden by morbidity
Saddened his breath
For those destined for his knife
Then suddenly  the strangest feeling
One that left the angels reeling
Atonement crept into his midst
Balsamic and anathema
Balsamic and anathema
Prelati full of stars
This abductor of his heart
Promised him horizons free of pain
But all the grand designs
Magic signs and midnight wines
He would stay and face his slayers
Cardinals and courtroom players
Whilst Prelati must now flee before
The pure and azure dawn
The gates were wide the phantom horses
Snorted restless to be gone
With enchantment's eyes upon the door
Once more he cried
'Come with me now'
Prelati full of stars
Tried to pull him from the dance
Summoning his Barron to perform
But as the Demon rose
In sweet miracles of prose
And propaganda came a proper bible storm
Lightning  grinning froze
On this murdersite of crows
And from the scattered ashes stepped a sylph
The maiden Joan of Arc
Crept more beautiful and dark
A paradise a cradle free of filth
She was chaste beyond all graces
The face of faith illuminated
More precious than Prelati's spell
A Goddess in a dream
And trembling in her arm
Her eyes a thousand golden psalms
That glittered as on Christmas night
He wept like Hallowe'en
He held the scene the poignant gleam
Of peace and great serenity
Close to his heart her parting kiss
He slept to wake released in bliss
Years of plead behind the walls
Chambers and vaults Scenes of fright
Unspoken Words in pain and dread
140 lives passed his hands
Gilles De Ray's
The perverted son
The holy man
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Alluring children for his masses
Robbing and buying young souls
Sacrifice to morbid demons
Satisfy his repulsive sexual lust
Gilles De Ray's
The perverted son
The holy man
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
So this is for the morbid one
The braveless and sick
Shivering laughter shrilled through the tombs
Sexual offence and perverted rites
Watching them limp and die
Wizards and darkness Gilles' dreams
Halfway came true
As a late medieval's French marshall
Unrestrained with endless ambitions
Personal guard for Jeanne D'Arc
the rising of his soul to god
Gilles De Ray's
The perverted son
The holy man
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Into Crypts of Rays
Overdone Mystism and
Desperate Satanism
Are just one small step apart
There's no human scheme in the beyond
Laced with lines from the end of time
From the herald and the bugler
High voltage bolts the cellar door
Switch thrown at midnight's peak
To start the heart of a scarlet whore
Gauged infernally
A poetess in night's profane station
Threading lies like silver seas
A seamstress for an amputee nation
Wedded to depravities
Devil to the metal
Devil to the metal
Diluting the authority of life with sewer brine
Laced with grime from the spiral of time
Wherein spins cruel order
The big hand strokes the Little Horn
Not thrown for charity
To win the sins of the decadent born
To wage eternally
Passion rides the great unholy
Ipsissimus of love's despair
Her ashen grin would shine if only
Death would not sit smiling there
Her beauty freezes reason
Like Helen at the reins
Of the rampant horse Apocalypse
On t he shore that it was made
Devil to the metal
DEVIL TO THE METAL
She fucks at unknown angles
Bleeds her victims to the bone
And in their guts untangled
Casts her runic eyes of stone
She will violate the future
Annihilate the past
Paving way in butcher trades
The red brick road through mankind's arse
Abandon reason life the veil
Darker seasons are released
Storm crows gather in black masses at the pane
Go to sleep beyond the pale
She is set to murder peace
Rome Jerusalem and Mecca are aflame
Dripping with the ripples of concern
Tear them from the stars I start to burn'
The big hand strokes the Little Horn
Not thrown for charity
To win the sins of the decadent born
To wage eternally
A poetess in night's profane station
Threading lies like silver seas
A seam stress for an amputee nation
Wedded to depravities
Devil to the metal
Devil to the metal
Devil to the METAL
Wishing in contempt of love
The righteous came to burn our forest
With hissing firebrands
For though we serve the gentle curves
Of our serpentgirdled Eastern Goddess
They thought they caught us
Kissing hearses in their land
Send away the pumpkin carriage
Blind mice in your head
Parade themselves like sacrilegious
Envoys of the dead
For in this house of the dark Madonna
Flesh will pleasure life
For free of sin we would dishonour
All that virgin sacrifice
Gut our city slaughter all within
Save the gold that goes to God
Show no pity for we worship sin
Spare not the old nor lightning rod
We raise our devil horns
To those who sit on high
For down amidst the thorns
We lie
Tonight the black guards came to rape
And ruin those souls empathising
With fleeing far away
Thrown to the Tigris river curves
Of our star tiaraed Ishtar rising
They thought they caught us
Courting Baphome t
Courting Baphomet
Gut our city slaughter all within
Save the gold that goes to God
Show no pity for we worship sin
Spare not the old nor lightning rod
She walked the world
When the world was made to dress
In a perfect darkness
A murderess in flame
Nature curled unleashed unfurled
The crack of a whip on the lips of anger
Why would your holy order
Not be wholly slain
Wishing in contempt of love
The righteous came to burn our forest
With just verses for the damned
For though we serve the gentle curves
Of our serpentgirdled Eastern Goddess
They thought they caught us
Pissing curses in the sand
We raise our devil horns
To those who sit on high
For down amidst the thorns
We lie
We raise our devil horns
So I shall conjure thee
demons of the Netherworld
For your names and seals are known
Evil
Slimy essence of corruption
Lord of Vice and Pestilence
Deity of Silent
Hear my words
Where will you be they tense for warfare
What will you see with your innocence there
Where will you be they tense for warfare
What will you see with your innocence there
Where will you be when God is glorifying
There we will be between the dead and dying
Where will you be when God is glorifying
There we will be between the dead and dying
Hear my words
Horaeus of Lion shape tailed with a serpent
Commander of the forces of Time and Space
Demon of Astrology
You shall arise
Beelzebub
Hideous of Aspect
_____ and Barron
Messengers of mean importance
Heed the power of my dark commands
Devoted to the votive holy standard above
'By command of the king of Heaven'
Came the death of Love
Where will you be when they're vilifying
How will they see when the truth is blinding
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they're vilifying
Where will you be when the dark is rising
How will you keep from it's terrorizing
Where will you be when the dark is rising
How will you keep from it's terrorizing
Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
But visions and ambition
Never listened to submission
And she was on a mission from the highest above
The death
The death of Love
The righteous death of love
For my ardour and my sensual delectation
I took a great number of precious little souls
Whom I killed and caused to be killed
Well it is to desire to be quit of this world 
In which there is nothing but misery
and then a golden flash like the onset of heaven
leaving her screams breaking my heart
and in the grip of fire
i knew the Death of love
Where will you be they tense for warfare
What will you see with your innocence there
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be they tense for warfare
Where will you be when God is glorifying
There we will be between the dead and dying
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when God is glorifying
Prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain
Devoted to the votive holy standard above
'By command of the king of Heaven'
Came the death of love
Where will you be when they're vilifying
How will they see when the truth is blinding
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they're vilifying
Where will you be when the dark is rising
How will you keep from it's terrorizing
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when the dark is rising
Burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
But visions and ambition
Never listened to submission
And she was on a mission from the highest above
To Lord upon the slaughter
Like a sword through hissing water
She arose where archers sought her
For the death of love
The righteous death of love
Gilles adored her drama
Her suit of pure white armour
Blazed against the English in a torrent of light
And as they rallied onto night
A cancer fled his soul
Dissolving
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame a Valkyrie
She made him click without desire
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when they caught her breath
Her words would leave a scar
'For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars'
How will you know if the sky is burning
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when Babel builds my fire
Will you not flee and label me pariah
Where will you be my darling
Where will you be when they light my pyre
Aligned with Joan in all
That was enthroned and divine
He swore to score the crimes
Jackdaws poured on this dove
Crimes he knew alone
Derived from minds of the blind
The church unfurled for murder perched
Upon the death of love
Framed amid the thick of fire
Aflame a Valkyrie
She claimed the skies were lit with spires
And in his eyes she swam a Goddess
And even when she fought for breath
Her words would leave a scar
'For only in the grip of darkness
Will we shine amidst the brightest stars'
When Joan was burnt
He knew malevolence
At the heart of all
A cold and jagged abyss bled of sense
The throne he earned
Through God's benevolence
Started his own fall
Clothing ragged dogma in his own magnificence
Here the stench the gold events
The bold inventions of the will
Every wanton bent desire went fulfilled
A Daemon sat upon the top of the world
Like a Herod over Genesis
They sang hosannas as his banners unfurled
Kissing terrors with paralysis
His brash canvas insulted the view
moving heaven and earth to please the
Tumultitudes whom his strange retinue drew
To assert the thirteenth Caesar
The thirteenth Caesar
Ichor kicked inside his veins
The thirteenth Caesar
War was licked for shame
The thirteenth Caesar
Sicker but just as vain
The thirteenth Caesar
Gilles De Rais
When Joan was burnt
He knew malevolence
At the heart of all
He swore henceforth he would serve evil alone
Here the stench the gold events
The insurrection of his will
Theatre and feasts past the ken of mortal men
Every wanton bent desire went fulfilled
A Daemon sat upon the top of the world
Like a Herod over genesis
They sang hosannas as his banners unfurled
Striking terror intro menaces
The thirteenth Caesar
Ichor kicked inside his veins
The thirteenth Caesar
War was licked for shame
The thirteenth Caesar
Sicker but just as vain
The thirteenth Caesar
Gilles De Rais
Suetonius and Ovid
Filled the moonstruck dreams
With the purple of Rome
His Venus of arenablood was dead
And he was storming home
The thirteenth Caesar
Ichor kicked inside his veins
The thirteenth Caesar
War was licked for shame
The thirteenth Caesar
Sicker but just as vain
The thirteenth Caesar
Gilles De Rais
Carrion my name
For those who choose to mouth the curse
A tragic serenade
With Judas in my stride
The gothic halls of shame
Where statues coldly hold no worse
Than the murders I reclaim
From a dark forsaken time
Kissing heavenspent
He wipes lips free of his hectic discharge
Wishing to repent
For the brute that ravaged free
In slight hands beauty weeps
Conquest's deep methodical screwing
Hurt repeatedly
Like the world wound at his feet
Dirge Inferno
As it is written damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
The past at last has come
A savage bite without respite
Pervades the freezing air
This winter chill grist for his mill
If tears of joy will blear elsewhere
And church bells drown in the cracks of doom
The storms above us hew
As lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
Deflowering two by two
Hissing malcontent
He storms the skies on electric dis charge
Pissing in contempt
On the effigies of the weak
Killing all resolve
The great beast simmers his scarlet women
Spit their vitriol
On the terrified face of peace
Dirge Inferno
As it is written damn it
So let it be wrung
From throats of those in overthrow
Our past at last has come
A hellbound heart the rose and thorn
Have locked to hasten blood
The moon disrobes to harden droves
Of legions pouring
These rivers press his breath adorns
Senates and enemy seats
Whilst his power takes as ingratitude
The writhing of the weak
Wormwood my name
The poisoned star that fell to earth
And blistered free of shame
In the pits of selfrebirth
Now those caves become a garret
Overseeing endless barracks
As the waters turn to claret
And the Vatican satins burn
Dusk and her embrace
When the sun has swept upon the waveless lake
And the mists steal in with ease
Covened wolves arc their eerie dissonant napes
In adoration of the moon and thee
They call as I to thee
And I will come as if in dream
My languid dark and lustrous Malaresian Queen
Of vengeful ancient breed
Gilded with the pelts of many enemies
Erishkigal ravenhaired
I can taste thy scent by candlelight
Legs of porcelain traced and laced to their lair
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
A black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
Like a poignant Madonna perverted to night
And I have ridden from the westerning light
To expend my lust
Tear away the funereal dress
Know that I will escape from my death
Lo The pale moonlight
Weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
Of mist and moth and the hunger inside
Kisses took to fever and fever demise
Through twilight darkness and moonrise
My scarlet tears will run
As stolen blood and whispered love
Of fantasies undone
Countess swathed in ebony
And snowwhite balletic grace
Rougefilmed lips procure the wish
For lust and her disgrace
Dusk and her embrace
We shall flit through the shadows
Like a dream of werewolves in the snow
Under deady nightshade
Still warmed with the kills of afterglow
Beneath the stars thy flesh bedevils me
Beneath the stars taste the death in me
Bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
To sever thin mortality
Elizabeth
My heart is thine
Thy fragrant words
Warm within like wine
Let me come to thee
with eyes like Asphodel
Moonglacing loose desires free
To writhe under my spell
Erishkigal ravenhaired
I know thy scent by candlelight
Immortal flesh I yearn to share
Appease the beast on spattered sheets
Dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
Nocternity
She shall come for me
Unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
How the full embosomed fog
Imparts the night to us
At the age of sixteen
I grew out of hope
I regarded the cosmos
Through a circle of rope
So I threw out my plans
Ran on to the wheel
And emptied my head
Of all childish ideals
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
I married the first girl
Who wasn't a man
And smiled as the spiders
Ran all over my hands
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
Made a good living
By dying it's true
As the world in my TV
Leaked onto my shoes
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
Waiting to be born again
Wanting the saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away
Nothing is what I feel
Waiting for the drugs to make it real
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away
Waiting to be disciplined
Aching for your nails across my skin
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away
Telepath Carbon trapped under stone
Brother mother pale body is thrown
Only way I know to have fun
Fill up my blood my veins my lungs
ESP city  rainy and blue
Burn down this town I give it to you
Aero shallow photograph blind
Stage fright black light coma divine
No sense of time
Sever tomorrow
Exitless mind  ESP Sever tomorrow
School out invective losing my voice
Film shredding on in multiple choice
America calls I must go
Oprah saviour I feel that low
Modem load and failsafe
Electric teenage dust
Hit the solvent keypad
Start the neural rust
Power on the highway
Data in my head
Surfing on the network
Part of me is dead
Every Home is Wired
Swimming in the circuit
Somebody has expired
This world will be the future
Every home is wired
Inside the vehicle the cold is extreme
Smoke in my throat kicks me out of my dream
I try to relax but its warmer outside
I fail to connect it's a tragic divide
This has become a full time career
To die young would take only 21 years
Gun down a school or blow up a car
The media circus will make you a star
Dark matter flowing out on to a tape
Is only as loud as the silence it breaks
Most things decay in a matter of days
The product is sold the memory fades
Crushed like a rose
In the river flow
I am I knowFamilies set apart
Woken up with a start
Like a scream in the night
The sound of a fight
Singles or couples
Seized like animals
Fugitives were shot
Killed on the spot
Invading enemies
Conquered territories
Military Breakthrough
On the run for freedom
Hiding for survival
Concentration camp
Guarding watch tramp
Packed out shacks
Only the strongest survive
Days and night in a cage
Locked and exploited
The destiny of a slave
Massive internment
Rude confinement
Broken up families
Piled up dead bodies
We belong to our families
 so does our blood
And for them we would shed it
Without a moment's hesitation
Gathering our 2 lines
Was a success thanks to
The maturity and
Respect of our elders
It's been 65 years
That our bloods were blended
And our families grow
Larger and stronger
Year after year
When the little Iano
Was brought in the world
The alliance was forged
We all have the same roots
And the same origins
Their source lies in the blood
Red like vengeance and the
Honor of our fathers
By hearing our music
The ones who know us know
Who are the leaders
And they know who beat time
Lu canto famigliare spargi
Violence e terrore pi li nostri nimici
Pace e calore pi li nostri amici
Fierta e onore pi nostri fratelli e sorelle
Born on an island
In the middle of nowhere
Our renown
Has now crossed the borders
And the name of the
Family is mentioned
With respect everywhere
Na nostra famiglia
Non' pardoniamo mai
Na nostra famiglia
Si vivi onoratamente
Na nostra famiglia
Non' naviemo pieta
Na nostra famiglia
Si vivi onoratamente
At home we don't talk because
Walls have ears and as
Our fathers used to say
A man who doesn't talk much
Is a man who knows
Na nostra famiglia
Seven days was all they wrote
I thought the field had clerared
Another suit challenged me
I have to make a choice
They're not bluffing this time
It's plain to see it's them or me
It makes me think
Seven days
Will quickly go
Seven days
So many ways
I can't run away
What they said keeps ringing in my head
I need some time
Need one more chance
Monday I could wait till
Tuesday If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
Does it bother me
Someone to talk to
When I get down
I won't run away
No place to run
No place to hide
I'm not blind
Though I know there's no way
To bring back yesterday
Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
Friday Saturday but Sunday'd be too late
Monday I could wait till
Tuesday If I make up my mind
Wednesday would be fine
Thursday's on my mind
Friday'd give me time
Saturday could wait
But Sunday'd be too late
Does it bother me
I don't care about
What people say
I still believe in myself
I still go
My own way
I don't know if it's right or wrong
I just feel confused and
My thoughts go away
Spend my life looking for something
What it is I don't know Looking for happiness
I found sorrow This place must be hell
You gotta know the rules
I'm slowly losing my mind
I've suffered hard
Can't take the pain no more
I'm gonna break these chains
I've got bad things on my mind
Spent my time breaking rules
That's a fact I like to gamble
But this time I won't lose
Life's a struggle
Life's a game
I made it through the hard times
I got nothing left to lose
So many things I can't explain
Life's a bitch  then you die
Mysteries and secrets deep inside us
The last creation of an ancient kind
Nuclear testing under the sun
Black rain and death left behind
Mysteries and secrets deep inside us
The last creation of an ancient kind
Nuclear testing under the sun
Black rain and death left behind
Darkened skies darkened skies
And for the next generations
Life under darkened skies
Man's new doctrine
A fast and total destruction
Mysteries and secrets deep inside us
The last intrusion of the human kind
In the natural order
And life will disappear
Under our darkened skies
And for the next generations
Life under darkened skies
And for the next generations
Life under darkened skies
Blood will follow blood
But not in the name of god
Come my friend and you will see
What means for us family
Facing us no compromise
Between us no place for lies
Facing us you won't survive
Between us it's do or die
There's a time for life
And a thousand ways to die
The thing that makes us strong
We think and fight as one
Tears will follow tears
For old friends disappeared
Come my friend and you will see
What means for us unity
Full of love full of respect
For your bro your mom your dad
Always honest with your friends
With yourself from birth till death
Full of love full of respect
For your bro your mom your dad
Always honest with your friends
With yourself from birth till death
Che un' tempu' pi viviri e
Mille sorte pi murire
Cosa canni fannu' forti
E pinsare e cummattere
Come una Bella famiglia
Here I am I have nothing to prove
Right now there's nothing left to loose
My only desire is to stay with you
But my ego told me to kill you too
I am not afraid of the consequences
There's a conflict between me
And my conscience
I'm known as the sickest one around
The fuckin' mad one who can bring you down
But remember for ever I'm your friend
Even if forever means your own end
Cause like death I'm insane and unstable
And like poison I can be sweet but horrible
If your soul is as cold and dark as mine
So join me at the table
Confusion's in my veins
Eternal hate's by my side
Deeply blinded by pain
From me you cannot hide
You were born and raised to take care
Of the members
Of your family and lead them on the right way
Crossing your native land
You learned and understood
The meaning of honor
Now you are one of them because
Of blood and honor
And to hunt unworthy traitors
To found the rules of the family
Laws of honor and war
Major and minor and criminal too
Honor and war
Respect  love  honor  famiglia
Respect  love  honor  famiglia
We all live honourably in our family
Honor and respect are laws
And treason is not forgiven
Laws of blood and silence passed down
From father to son
 these are the laws of the family
Respect  love  honor  famiglia
Respect  love  honor  famiglia
Respect of values is essential
Show me the way to defeat my stronger enemy
Send me the power of hate
The demons of flesh
Your justice is done friendship is gone
This world is ruled by the gods of war
Angry eyes narrow minds
We're facing the beginning of
A new century with death in our eyes
Mankind is trapped in a nightmare of freedom
Entering darkness light left behind
We are the witnesses of the downfall of humanity
Angry eyes narrow minds
We're facing the beginning of
A new century with death in our eyes
Angels of pain demons of war
Angels of pain demons of war
The skies are crying the earth is bleeding
The tears of the god they loved
A tide of lies
Our last temple is a temple of flesh
Deep in our hearts
Where evil is waiting
Waiting for the demons of intolerance
Where evil is waiting
Waiting for the demons of intolerance
Cornered in the cold side of life
Trapped into this world of lies
The world's upside down
Dreams are falling to pieces
There's no more hope to be found
Searching the strength to resist
Sometimes the world's against me
You think you know what's good for me
I don't ask anything
I don't wanna be locked
For life in the cage you have set up for me
This time I turn
I keep my eyes wide open
You think you know what's good for me
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will stand
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will fight
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will stand
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will fight
I try  I learn  I live  I will make it
A new era has come
I'm the only master of my destiny
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will stand
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will fight
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will stand
Till my last breath  for freedom  I will fight
The melodies of your temptation
Such painful expectation
Suddenly flashed passion
I hide my secret in your dreams
Avoiding a solution I am afraid of a pain
The bleeding memoirs
And your words as a thorn in heart
The wounds are so deep
Like the rivers of despair
Invisible patterns on heart
Pictures of your reflections
I see them through my dreams
And I wake up for my pain
Somewhere there it is deep in heart
The melodies of your temptation
Such painful expectation
Suddenly flashed passion
Leave me your pain a pain to remember
Bitter consolation for my loneliness
So deep in heart rhymes of farewell words
You leave exempting me to feel it all again
The pain disappears but together with me
We separately die to feel it all again and again
The cold of a flame sting us
And we freeze
And we freeze in absurd sufferings
ItÃÂ´s our own tragedy
So strange for no one of us
But such bitter only for us
They any more do not warm
As we once
And we freeze in absurd sufferings
ItÃÂ´s our own tragedy
So strange for no one of us
But such bitter only for us
 only for us
Someone of us has put out this flame
Our reflections has gone
And you leave my hand
We donÃÂ´t want to remember we are dead
ItÃÂ´s our own
 by fiery stone down to the sky
Into the fog on a threshold of dawn
On lunar path in blindness
Obey the charms of my magical voice
To your deceits again
DonÃÂ´t let in because I am
Because I am coming to you
To your deceits again
Alone with your reflections
I confess you in eternity
Wait for at the edge of time
IÃÂ´ll return for with the last star gone out
The heavenly wine has been shed
No one cries anymore
Only bitter honey on your lips
And your deceits again
 by fiery stone down to the sky
Into the fog on a threshold of dawn
On lunar path in blindness
Obey the charms of my magical voice
To your deceits again
DonÃÂ´t let in because I am
Because I am coming to you
To your deceits again
Alone with your reflections
I confess you in eternity
Wait for at the edge of time
IÃÂ´ll return for with the last star gone out
It corrodes from within burns me
It poisons from within destroys me
It cripples from within enslaving me
It incinerates from within burying me
There is too much for me
Everything is in your words
There is too much for pain
Everything is in your eyes
 leave me alone
 if you can
Leave me if you can
I have no forces
Leave me if you can
Allow me to die in loneliness
Erase all inside of me
Lay your hand on my eyes
Close the sun from me
 from illusions and jealousy
 for ever
The darkness creeps into my eyes
Am I alive No IÃÂ´m just without heart
Illusions There is my rest forever
Jealousy In despair I am left
Eyes are close hands are lowered
Words are said the life is lived
ItÃÂ´s never to return IÃÂ´ll try to forget
IÃÂ´ll allow you to come only in my dream
Leave me if you can
I have no forces
Leave me if you can
Allow me to die
Leave me if you can
Plead leave me if you can
You can see me with closed eyes
You can feel me with your skin
Your every night has approaching my rapture
And your grief burns in my every word
Cry weÃÂ´ll never to touch each other because
Because IÃÂ´m inside of you
Cry you suffer from my eternity
I am your bitter cold solitude
IÃÂ´m in your lives with confession
IÃÂ´m with you suffer from frankness
And something torments inside your soul
You can forget your life if itÃÂ´s not me
Cry weÃÂ´ll never to touch each other because
Because IÃÂ´m inside of you
Cry you suffer from my eternity
I am your bitter cold solitude
You can see IÃÂ´m in you
You can feel IÃÂ´m with you
Because IÃÂ´m inside of you
I am your cold solitude
Whispering IÃÂ´m leaving for ever
Emptiness is closing your eyes
I can embrace your dream with your illusions
And for the morning you will not wake up
Cry weÃÂ´ll never to touch each other because
Because IÃÂ´m inside of you
Cry you suffer from my eternity
I am your bitter cold solitude
Hold it your hands such cold and severe
Shadow the unique gift from you
I press to heart I feel nothing
And with every beat
You leave me with every suffering
 the unique gift from you
I press to heart I feel nothing
And with every breath
 with every suffering
You nothing to recollect I always waited
So it is far from light I am cold it is hurt me
It will return again I shall wait
I shall be ready to leave forever
Stare I donÃÂ´t believe I am in your hands
My heart is in your hands I am in your
Shadow the unique gift from you
I press to heart I feel nothing
And with every breath
 with every suffering
IÃÂ´ve never burnt my heart
IÃÂ´ve never met a dawn with tears
IÃÂ´ve never felt pains up to you
Honey for my wounds
Temptation is so cruel
I touch your shadow I wake up
IÃÂ´ve never been afraid of lonely nights
Honey for my wounds
Let your words to warm
Let your eyes to bewitch
Let your breath become mine
Honey for my wounds
Can you read my dreams
Can you share my loneliness
Let your lips becomes my honey
Honey for my wounds
WeÃÂ´re
Going to believe but we are dreaming now
DonÃÂ´t let anything to disturb your wounds
It is just a dream
Cease nothing else
This sun does not warm
 of your sweet
There is nothing surprising
 her cold embraces
She touches my palm
Like itÃÂ´s a snow recovered me
She is daring embracing stones
Inhaling the passion
By her temptation
No I donÃÂ´t trust in her sorcery
My heart is beating in these stones
My heart is bleeding in your sores
IÃÂ´m only a sunset filled by melancholy
Engraved in her delight
 my name
My heart is beating in these stones
My heart is bleeding in your sores
Recover meI want you
To hear the cry
Throughout the night
We know what it means
The new is old
And red is white
The law they preach
Ain't what it seems
I want you
To hear the noise
We'll take the world
And gonna shout and scream
Celebration
Destination
Celebration
Of your life
He was standin' at the big loadin
When all the trucks and buses rolled up
Dirty jeans and a leather jacket
Full of patches of all those heavy bands
He wasn't very hard to talk to
And looked like he had nowhere to go
Easy easy rocker
Always on the run
Easy easy rocker
Together we'll be strong
Now the stage is a white burnin'fire
And the planet is ready to explode
The music is new and the music is hot
And we all came here for the magic ride
The scream of eternal life
Runs through every icecold soul tonight
Now the seats and the streets and the bars
Are runnin'empty
But the sounds and the songs and the lights
Still splash your brain
I can see in your eyes what you need
And I just call you
You know crazy nelly
She's crossed eyed and dumb
She's dirty and she's smelly
But she's got a lovely bum
Her hair is bloody grotty
Her breath stinks like the pest
Her skin is dry and spotty
But her arse is just the best
She's gettin'easy money
And welfare from the state
Oohsmelly nellyyou're so divine
Oohsmelly nellybaby be mine
Her body's fat and flabby
Her rotten teeth just stink
Her clothes are torn and shabby
But her lips are nice and pink
Her nickers are encrusted
With shit and bugs and lice
This face is bruised and busted
But her arse is paradise
She's gettin'easy money
And welfare from the state

Mrsixty nine Mrsixty nine
It's a bad joke the way in which he died
He did choke on a lady's sanitary pad
Oh you lucky angels heaven will be fine
Havin'lots offun with Mrsixty nine
I can see by your eyes what you need
I'll be out of your life
I may get depressed cause I tried so hard
To be somethin'special for you
Words of love that are still in my ears
Days when I kissed your tears
Long crazy nights spilling into days
Times when I lost my fears
She's got everything I need
And it's drivin' me insane
She's got everything I need
Makes me smile and makes me weep
Love needs a heart and I need to find
If I was treatin'you right
Angels and sailors rich girls and us
Are searchin'for true love tonight
In a restaurant
Drinkin' beaujolais wine
You're with your favourite girl
And you're passin'the time
Well you look through the papers
Holocaust in the roxy
Five hours later
You're lovin'your lady
I can see
Burnin'bones of war
I can see
Ashes on the floor
There stands a soldier
In a barbedwire land
The fear of death in his eyes
And a bottle in his hand
But now the wine he's drinkin'
It's got the taste of blood
No more plastic war movies
To show him what it's like
You give me money
You give me lovin'
Sweet satisfaction
Of the first degree
You never need me
When I'm away
'Cause there's somebody
For you to play
So close your eyes
And stay with me
In rock city
And ease your worried mind
In rock city
I love the lies
It tells your story
Your dirty pictures
Of the last six years
Your life is backstage
Where the joint is rockin'
And there you're the sweetest queen
Of all the girls so shockin'
Well you give me all your money
And you give me all your love
The sweetest satisfaction
Yes it's all in first degree
But whenever I'm away
You always find somebody else
Dirty pictures tell the lies
You've lived the last six years
Backstageyou're rockin'
Backstageyou're shockin'
I've been waitin'for so long
Gettin'had and treated wrong
Sleepless nights and dirty lies
Makes no difference if you live or die
But it's over now
I'm a winning man
'Cause babe
I live my life the way I choose
Satisified not much to loose
If you don't feel you'll never know
Just what I've been goin'thru'for so long
Mother's got a lover half as old as she
Father's got a gamblin'house in capri
Sister sue's a junkie dope and LSD
Sells her arse to the arabs while others
Get it free
So I'm the black sheep
The only hang up I've got
Is an old guitar
And a cat named lisalott
Mad racketyou've got it
Mad racketyou've got it
Women's undergarments are simon's bag
He's a transvestite he's a fag
Auntie ann is a schizo crazy as they come
She thinks she is a chicken stickin'feathers
In her bum
So I'm the black sheep
The only hang up I've got
Is an old guitar
And this is not a curse
At least not by the hands of another
Your refuse
Will fertilize
Your own children
And the tunnel is burrowed eternally
As time digests itself
It worms through the path
And is excreted
As time digests itself
Gargantuan malformation
Worms through the path
And is excreted
When the truth won't do
And lies are so fulfilling
Hollow words
Beget hollow gestures
Hollow gestures
Beget hollow ventures
This impulse that dictates our nature
Drives us to dysfunction
Belligerent apathy
Belligerent apathy
Belligerent apathy would suit us so much better
But our motives are too impure
Reflection
Is but a stranger
These strings set rigorous routine
Cracks form covering my body
Weakened blistered and torn apart
Revisiting old wounds
Completing the circle
Once again
Swollen eyes fixed on the prize
We hang our heads in selfdestructive triumph
These fault lines
A soul erosion
Predictions never became so clear
Disillusioned with complacence
We craft our past
Peering down this tunnel ever so far
Cracks shed light
Another day fails the shadow
One by one another chapter closes
Nostalgic echo
Perpetually reverberates
In the teeth of all experience
We still stand
Immersed in reflection
Memories linger and cling like dirt
The yearning increased at
Exponential rates
But you wanted no part
Mortally content
Until the surge gave shock
And got you on all fours
Interface fucked
Inside a cubicle that looks of detachment
Is it the size or the angle the point is clear
The mortal erection has run out of skin
We're hooked on electric stimuli
Wandering lost
In a place of disillusionment
Gives way to glacial edifice
Narrow spaces with towering frigid walls
Monolithic blocks of ice
Stacked to the sky
Reflective surfaces
Confuse
And obscure all
Boundaries
Is it over
Has it begun
But when the balance is
Disrupted
The iceblocks will
Rain down
Derange the scale of trust
With this animated prevarication
That once passed for happiness
Degenerate into character
The clearest of all intentions
Words drawn out
Unfiltered
A perception
Untainted by logic
We are such low things
With null for a name
And while we quietly become
Imperceptible
We are such low things
With null for a name
The inner monologue exposed
But this curtain is drawn closed
Ships of oblivion
Fall from the sky
The leaves are fallen angels trying
To remember how to fly
I've spent my whole life trying to understand
Why the tree of life is dead
And I finally reached the answer
Its shadow had nothing else to shade
But a portrait of pain
Withered leaves
With their remains they paint the world
This autumn will live forever
Through my song and through my words
There's a stranger in the mirror
But I can recognize the chain
That keeps me nailed to the canvas
Of a portrait of pain
This is the season
When God will become an atheist
This is the reason
Why the fire will quench the thirst
I'm the shadow who didn't have a tree
I'm the shadow who didn't have a Sun
Being more than the eye could ever see
I'm the shadow who shades within me
A portrait of pain
And before you die
Just remember this my friend
There's no noisy end
Silently you'll say Good Bye
Still between you lips
I know there is a silent shout
There are words about
Your personal apocalypse
Rain of fire baby
Rain of fire
Falling down deep into your head
Rain of fire baby
Rain of fire
A silent candle to watch your final end
For the longest sleep
The fire will be your only shroud
Tears won't be allowed
There's no point for you to weep
In the final scene
Of this drama puppets show
You won't even know
Why you burn and what's your sin
A fallen soul doomed to fail
A broken wing a shining scale
The guardian the keeper
Of the secret signs
A crawling been hiding into a hole
The serpent of brass put upon a pole
Immortal The symbol
Of the underworld
The memories of the Snake
An endless battle it never forsakes
The beast coiled around the Sun
Is the weapon of the Pharaoh's crown
Biting its tail shedding its skin
The heart is cold but it burns within
The cycle The symbol
Of eternity
Strained you hear the silent roar
Right before the storm
Your ears are deaf
But the sound is jabbed
Deep into your mind
Deep into your mind
Wait for something to come
But you can't see a soul
Like a prey you feel
The raptors' breath
You can feel that your end is near
Strained you wait to meet your doom
You have no time to shed a tear
On your skin the blood in bloom
Fear coiled in your heart
Like a starving worm
You can't see the Death
Coming in your way
On my knees
I kiss the ground and pray
To defeat my enemies today
For this I spill a drop of blood
A small gift for all my pagan gods
Help me crush
The ramparts down and be
The last thing that my enemies will see
For this I spill a drop of blood
A small gift for all my pagan gods
I'm pagan and proud
Let me shout it loud
I'm pagan and proud
Let me shout it loud
And if I die
Let it be on the battlefield
Let the others carry me back on my shield
Then let me burn and help me fly
Give me a star up in the sky
Fear is the weapon
Against all those
Who bow their heads
What about your own choice
What if you'll raise your voice
What do you have to loose
The silence is no excuse
The blind follow the blind
And no one expects there is something to find
A thief in the country of fools
Is a powerful king who makes his own rules
Deny denial
The hell was full so I came back
I fought my way until I found a crack
Through your mind and through your soul
I am the name that you are afraid to call
A shadow coiled deep in your mind
I am still one of a kind
The fear made them hate my name
So this is how I became
The lord of flies
I can't forget what I used to be
How the people worshiped the soil fertility
Even if a new religion threw me straight to hell
I know that I'll always be the Zebul Beel
When I come down in the arena
I know I fulfill a sacred act
The bravery of fighting the beasts
Turns my death into a feast
Gladiators spill the blood
For the glory of their God
For the last time we see the sky
We who are about to die
When the metal meets the flesh
I defy death
With my shield or on my shield
I'll finally meet the Elisian Field
In death
The only fear that I know
Is to lay down dead by the end of the show
But if it happens I'll keep my breath
'Cause Pollice verso means my death
Any moment could be the last
There is no future there is no past
My fading breath is all that I feel
The end is near the end is real
Between the walls of a golden palace
That came out like a bud from the desert sand
The poet of the court glorifies the deeds
Of the sultan who rules over that wasted land
A caravan of words threads before his eyes
But a distant whisper breaks his dream
Could be the wind Could be just a lie
Slowly the whisper turns into scream
And the wind keeps on calling his name
And the desert drives him insane
Arabia An endless land
Where there is no boundary
Between dreams and reality
Realm of sand
Where the mirage floats in the air
Turning the hope into despair
The words so plain seem to draw a shape
That soon becomes crystal clear
A girlish pale face black diamonds as her eyes
Suddenly decides to go and meet his love
Through those deceptive desert sands
He walks she runs He runs she disappears
Deep into the desert Where he'll find his end
Take two coins and put them
Upon your eyes
Then be ready for the final journey
Far away from the promised sky
You suffered hard you suffered well
Behind a happy mask your tears can tell
That I'm right when I say
The life is hard and after that you pass away
Do you think that dying
Is ending the strife
Hm Then you must prepare yourself
For another slice of life
'Cause everything is on its way to something
In the afterlife this is what you'll see
You wait for your death with an infinite emotion
But even dead you'll never cease to be
In motion
The sleepless soul of decorum
Leave my body in anachronism
I will fade away
Radiant opium elevation
Won't be my sommertimes
Take the deam lead me
Own my inside be my shelter
End this moment of infinity
Out stretched arms lay down next to me
As telltale winds stand pail
Morphic ocean
In my mirror halls
The mellow rhythm of slaw rainfall
Hammer my pure splitted foam
Chrome wings of goldenfish paraded
Creep on the horizon
Boil condensed liquid
Around walls of corridors
Dry up my carapace
Anathematized amphora
Wich sinner could go to paradise
Who could fly with no wings
Who could live with mankind without a tear
I'm the paradise sinner
I could fly with no wings
Let me spleen
Allright
Babe come to see dady bitch

Engravers point on heart
The demiurge breaks me down
My soul
My soul is black like a bird
Lies raven priceless
Ahead to mediatic crosses
Engulfed spirally's crown
Engulfed lustfull desire
Darkness
Abyssic cliches
None habits gather my churches
I am not the trembler
Become my serpent slaved to blissful promises
Just a point in this deep purple cover
Absorbed blood on my back shows
Black at heart
Bindweed at heart
I'm black at heart
Numb opacity
Guises misled
Forsake me humanity
Crushed by wither away
Torn apart
Doors opened valley
Falls into devoid glams
Numb opacity
Guises misled
Of black I'm covered
Silently I scream loveless
Of black I'm covered
Silently I scream loveless
Plans passed as steamy vast pointless
Just one second
I wanna be
I wanna be a momentbody
Release me
A momentbody
I wanna be
Release me

Where seven impaled widows shine under my semen
 Why are you worshipping a human genocide
 I'm watching the downfall
My sex on on cold marble
Licking tears of mankind's cry 
I didn't stop I just stole
And speaking hot
Of my corporal punishment
 Hey see it later 
 Death mas mine thank you
 Talk to me my pleasure
Are you smoking to forget
 Oblivion
Always the utter sorrow
Last hope  last love
 Something I can hate for you
You're more alive
 I forgot to appreciate life
It's too late for me
 No no no no
This is life
Right here
Noooo This is life
Right here
Right now
Take it
Globe my breast
Let you be Atlas
My ever ending spere
Oh please
 Thank for being the one bit of light
In an ever darken dream
Ever darken dream
 I wanna know
 I don't believe you 
 I wanna know 
 Shark nacle of blood
For how long I praise
The beauty of the aquatic city
I am dead for 23 years now
Hell is right 
 Who was the murderer 
 I was sure
I am a monolith
Sect of our heart
My belief in religion
Rise high in the sky
Own preacher
Hatetress desires
Ruin my throne of celtic empire
Of celtic empire
Gold
Stones black and grey
Sculpt dark universe
Genocide
Holocaust
Empire of ethnocide
Holocaust
Empire of ethnocide
Heart as a monolith in ruins
Fly high  ride the northern winds
Turn ashes to immortality
Dark paradise in blue cyan sea
Be hater of mankind
Yiel the lament
Be hater of mankind
Toward the monolith
Toward the monolith
Emotional climate
Cleverness of purple blaze
Conquest your fidelity
Monolith throne of stone
Fly under my drug out of my body
Out of my body
Ouh
Teleportate through the flames of the sea
Reverse the process of sweet mother nature
From me Monolith comes my path
Comes my path
The lots bathed in sea
Cover the world bath in the sea
Only an earth plot emmerge
Banished planet with no life ends
Sea create seeds
Pistil sprink salt water
Germinate in the air
As clouds pierced by babylon tower
Let the branches begin their cycle
Au bout de sa tige un bourgeon fleurit
Please praise the arrival in this virgin flore
Between the rock  sea
Rise the lotus high in the sky
Offer him a place to be
Snuffle the smell of the oxygen
The lotus flower's growing
See reaction of its self destruction
My self destruction
Oh no more life
Pushing a third of its power
Erased to the oath
Abyss point the seeds creation
Abyss point the seeds creations begin
It have to be worshipped for been the Abraham
Power splits the Earth
The lotus gives life  death
Of patel and it's the mighty one
Two parcels Freedom  harmony
Of patel it is the mighty one
Freedom is my thoughts of human being
The sea is the harmony
Lotus I will build your church
And my emotion is falling tears by tears
Through this marvelous perfume of creation
Pretending eyes behind your grin
Ethereal silence of the end
You fake your smile for your defense
For the lives we have to swallow
Makes it hard to be your friend
I try not to follow no no no no no
I'm in pain but I don't care
And it breaks your will to burn
Do you think to understand
We're bold as we still turn
Whoa
I think that I don't care
Whoa
I think that I don't care
So bite your tongue to save your sins
The lack of smile for you're the end
For the lives we have to swallow
Makes it hard to be your friend
I try not to follow no no no no no
I'm in pain but I don't care
And it breaks your will to burn
Do you think to understand
We're bold as we still turn
I'm in pain but I don't care
And it breaks your will to burn
FÃÂ
ck off
Youre nothing but a fickle fucker
Hah
I'm in pain but I don't care
And it breaks your will to burn
Do you think to understand
We're bold as we still turn
I'm in pain but I don't care don't care
Do you think to understand
Towards the system
Fight the system fight back
People die in police custody
Where's the justice in that don't see none
Fight the system fight back
We've been shit on far too long
There are no equalities no freedom
Fight the system fight back
Stand up fight for freedom
Stand up fight for your rights
Fight the system fight back
Government and queen are your only enemies
Don't be fooled by their plastic smiles
They don't wanna know your views of war
They never stop to think about you
They want you kept in the darkness of 
The realities of war
Meat flung yards apart from bodies
Are typical sights of war
Twisting words words for their own gain
Led up another garden path
Kept in darkness and fed on crap
It's a messed up fucked up fuckin' system
They're always there with their restrictions
Always there to put you down
Anarchy's the only solution now
It's a messed up fucked up fuckin' system
You take part in creating this system
That we all must suffer in
We can't stop going round and round
We got to fix this rat race
This is the system you helped to create
They use you for corruption schemes
You're the unrealized and unintended
You're the one the one they don't like
You let them know your fears
This is the system you helped to create
You ask me why I'm fighting the system
Why I'm preaching anarchy
I'm fighting for the freedom
This is the system you helped to create
Well you ass crawling bastards suck my arse
Religion Jesus Christ it's all a fucking farce
A stray bullet kills an innocent child
Nothing's gained and nothing's solved
Religion instigates this hate and war
A stray bullet kills an innocent child
Nothing's gained and nothing's solved
Hands are held
Within your hands
Every breath a gift
Laughter rings within your walls
A room they fill may silent fall
My sorrow is yours
Photographs
Adorn the wall
Where autumn sun
Long shadows cast
Memories of treasured times
Our burning hearts lock tears inside
My sorrow is yours
In the words of many I'm your saviour
In the words of many I am lies
In the words of many I walked blind
If you see me
Who am I
If you know me
Who am I
Did I conquer the grave can I save the lost
Or forever a figure carved and broken on a cross
From the eyes that drew you in
From confessions of our sins
My love
Don't turn away
From the beauty of our song
From the days we knew no wrong
My love
Don't turn away
From the ties within our hearts
From the world we've torn apart
My love
Don't turn away
From the arms that long for you
From the pathways we walked through
My love
Don't turn away
From the tears of pain and love
From the wars we rose above
My love
Don't turn away
From the hands now quivering
From these unseen golden rings
My love
Don't turn away
Many times you've laughed with me
Your smile stays with me
Lights the darkness that found me
In this emptiness
Til I walk with you again
Time is slow to heal this pain
Light is dimmer than before
Even though I'm seeing more
Beacons shine throughout the night
Even for you child of light
A passage to another shore
Distant friend and open door
Yours forevermore
My summer child
I remember you
Running through the leaves
And hiding behind trees
Now you wonder what is true
Don't you remember good things too
Another day slips away
In these times of separate lives
Mine is still calling out to you
Is there nothing I could do
Such a trial you've been through my child
So many paths
You will journey on
One day come find me
Upon this distant shore
I know you wonder what is true
And you remember good things too
Another day drifts away
You can stay and never question why
You may be afraid of nothing
You may wonder what horizons hide
And become a slave to yearning
No one can go
Where you must go
Find your way home
When you leave
And who knows where these summers go
How the winter comes so quickly
We can stay here as seasons ebb and flow
As we watch the endless flight of the free
No one can go
Where they must go
To find their way home
When they leave
I wish for you the very best
As selfish love I lay to rest
The years which you have given me
Brought me strength and liberty
The skies grew black with clouds of rain
The nights so long with no refrain
Where once was light and beauty here
Our days were darkening in fear
I long for her and for our love
I long to see blue skies above
My eyes are dim and weakening
No refuge in this world of sin
Down to my world came a shining star
Down in the deep where the darkness rolls
Where she illuminated night and day
She took my hand and I was born in flames
She came in storms that made the windows shake
Behind rain misted panes I'd look and wait
That night forever stays within my thoughts
Loved her from then until I breathe no more
And if this should be my last song to thee
Sing beside my grave
Shine your light on me
See the woods where we would walk in leaves
In our first autumn in the smoky air
Like a child I carved our names into a tree
And if this should be my last song to you
Walk beside my grave in the morning dew
Though my heart death has claimed
Let my words of love remain
It's no secret now everyone knows
It's my shoulder the night uses to cry
My bedroom with six hundred windows
My feet where the truth comes to die
Where the moon can't stop weeping
While the tide washes the prints in the sand
Your eyes that seek out new meaning
Your scared broken soul in my hands
This pulse that's been chained to you
Dandelions amidst lilies of snow
Someday I will see through your disguise
Someday pick my name from your lies
Till then I'll hide my soul in your book
And I'll yield to the flood of your innocence
With my cheap pleads and my sanity
And you may carry me down to the darkness
Wipe my slate with a flick of your wrist
Take this verse this accursed harness
It's yours now it's all that there is
It's no secret now everyone knows
It's my shoulder the night uses to die
My bedroom with six hundred windows
My feet where truth and hope die
As a drop of rain dries on my lips
And the wind rustles through my hair
As shadows chased by light
The sound of your voice has vanished
And the memories make my blood calcify
And they scar my own image
All alone
I try to walk away
Away from it all
But my own footsteps are hunting me
Night falls along with me
All alone
As a drop of rain dries on my lips
And the wind rustles through my hair
As shadows chased by light
Shadows
Chased
By light
They scar myself
They scar my own image
Make my skin crawl and whisper
And last breath he took made me feel all alone
So fucking alone
Fucking alone
I'm sure
Counting the lines around your mouth
A method precise
I make my careful unpenned notes reflect
The red rims around bloodshed irises
Your blotchet skin and cracked down lips
And now I will
Now shatter these fragments
They tell me my own sad stories
At night
They tell me my own stories
I'm sure
Counting the lines around your mouth
A method precise
Fragments
Now shatter these fragments
Shatter
I must have been
Written in pencil
Somewhere on your surface
The depths of you
Reserved for someone else
I lift and flake
And then Im gone
With one quick breath
Soft and bruised
I linger
Soft and bruised
And you are there
For all the world to see
My shell translucent
And you are there
For all the world to see
And you are there for all the world
The depths of you are now carved
Carving in my bones
The depths of you are now carved in my bones
On my surface
And you are there
For all the world to see
Carving in my bones

Locked in chains left forlorn
Awaiting your doom
Placed with sadistic intent
Just above the high water mark
With the tide the rats will come
And surround you in the dark
Hungry little devils
With razor sharp incisors
Tiny rapid gnawing teeth
Cutting through flesh like scissors

Death comes slow bite by bite
Gnawed to death eaten alive

Looking good and Im feeling right 
I grab my keys and Im on the road 
Pick up the guys now its time for the show 
Cause its what makes us feel alive 
Forget the weekdays nows the time 
Annihilations turn is now 
Forget the weekdays nows the time 
Annihilation 
Lets get fucked up lets be proud 
You say today all you need is a breakaway 
Tonight we're getting fucked up 
Heading out on an awesome night 
Looking good and Im feeling right
I grab my keys and Im on the road 
Pick up the guys now its time for the show
Cause its what makes us feel alive 
Forget the weekdays nows the time 
Lets be proud 
You're wasted shitfaced 
Everything seems fucking great 
Time flies you don't know why
Soon its time to say goodbye 
Walk home such a fucking mess 
But no remorse no fucking stress
The night consumed through a shot glass
Lets get fucked up
Lets be proud
With my life in one hand that is slipping away 
How did you think this would end 
The thorns in my chest are flaying my skin 
Writhing in pain I want to let go 
My torn insides make it impossible to breathe 
I dont need this I dont want this anymore
Say something you fuck say anything 
Youre going down with me 
Youd better not fucking disagree 
With my life in one hand that is slipping away 
How did you think this would end 
Say what you say 
Youll never be worthy of your integrity 
Get your shit together 
All the mistakes you have made in your life 
Are finally coming back to make things right 
Youve been so careless over the past 
Now its coming back to you 
All the mistakes you have made in your life 
Are finally coming back to make things right 
Youve been so careless over everything
This will no longer happen
I can hardly hear my breathing 
An adrenaline rush gushes through my throat 
I can hardly believe I've done this 
It was the right time no crying alone 
Forever secluded in my own self 
Hundreds of needles puncturing my skin 
Brutalized criticized mentally abused 
I can see them laughing right in front of me 
Compromised in my eyes you can feel my rage 
I can see the objects crush into their face 
Yeah But this is now 
I've got a plan and I'm laughing out loud 
This is fucking now 
I've been waiting for this moment so long 
After the bullshit all the gossip and jokes 
The way they look the way they look tonight 
Trying to put their entrails back inside 
Brutalized criticized mentally abused 
I can hear them laughing right in front of me 
Compromised in my eyes you can feel my rage 
I can see the objects crush into their face 
Merciless 
Beautiful people havent you heard 
The jokes on you Its revenge of the nerds 
Beautiful people havent you heard 
Now the jokes on you
I was walking through the darkness of my mind 
I discovered a place where I could find 
A side of me that would always be broken
 So I looked in the mirror 
I just saw it so clear 
Saw the eyes of a monster 
Finally faced my own fears 
I chased the shadows away 
Admitted what I really am 
I can feel it inside making its way out of me 
The dark passenger 
I discovered a place where I could find 
A side of me that would always be broken 
A side of me that would always be 
So I looked in the mirror 
My reflection appeared 
As what I really am 
As what I really feel 
I chased the shadows away 
Admitted what I really am 
I can feel it inside making its way out of me 
Making its way out of me
I see a disturbing face staring straight at me 
Cant say who the fuck it is or what it wants 
And it wont take its eyes off of me 
My body paralyzes my eyes just cannot open 
The fear invades me The blood rushes to my head 
I cant wake up I cant wake up 
Please stop staring at me looking at me 
I cant wake up please wake me up 
Please stop staring at me looking at me 
My body paralyzes my eyes just cannot open 
The Family 
Look around see all of us gathered 
Granted with the gift of pleasure
Draining our lungs into laughter 
Crushing the bones of a scorched bird 
Sweet blood gushing down my throat 
Life seems good life seems easy 
Damn not those who lay unfortunate 
Damn not those who live in hell 
Cherish the time we spend together 
Thy soul wont shine forever 
Listen to my voice listen to it close 
This is our feud of depravity 
Our last chance to immortality 
Our prose will prevail 
Life seems good life seems easy 
Damn not those who lay unfortunate 
Damn not those who live in hell 
A tear scars my face 
A scar that reminds us who we are 
A tear scars my face 
We are the ones that will shine
The blood is rushing up to my head 
I feel pissed off by the moment 
And its all because of you 
Because its true 
Cant go on like this much longer 
My weakness is growing stronger 
You know it cause its true 
So dont bother 
Go blame it on your father 
Go blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Its all because of you 
Blame it on your father 
Blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Its all because of you 
Your innocence has been lost 
Your sweetness is a lost cause 
You try to make me feel like its my fault 
Cant go on like this much longer 
My weakness is growing stronger 
You know it cause its true 
Youre cowardly disgusting 
For me you are just nothing 
You fake what you really are 
Dont bother 
Go blame it on your father 
Go blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Its all because of you 
Blame it on your father 
Blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Its all because of you because of you 
Dont bother 
Go blame it on your father 
Blame it on your mother 
You know it cause its true 
Oh tomorrow
And the wheel keeps turning in the skies
Never close your eyes before tomorrow
A new life a new love will find its way
So hold on child to what you've got
To your dreams your visions and your heart
Hold on child and wait until dawn
Because tomorrow is the seed of a new life
There's a light in the darkness
Oh tomorrow
And the wheel of fortune's turning round
Never close your eyes before tomorrow
Because the fire of love is still alight
So hold on child to what you've got
To your dreams your visions and your heart
Hold on child and wait until dawn
Because tomorrow sees the end of your night
Come as you are Lay your body next to mine
Your heart in my hands
May my love and my silence inspire your soul
Oh come as you are
Come as your are Death's not more but a dream 
that seems so unreal
Oh come as you are
No more tears to cry as the sea rolls on by
No more lonely nights 
Yet an angel stands by your side
Just come to me
The child and the man
The fool and the sage that you are
Oh come as you are
As the time has come for me to leave this world
How I longed to probe into the guarded mystery
I've seen the light in the dawning day
I've seen love  in a burning haze
I've tasted blood on your lips
Divine magenta  heavenly
No drug did take me higher than the scent of you
No fire be as fervent as your desire
Where ever you are where ever you roam
For you I sing the sweetest song
Salve Regina
Quae pervia caeli porta manes et stella maris
Vita dulcedo et spes nostra Salve
Ave Regina Caelorum
Ave Domina Daemonum
Salve Radix ex qua mundo lux est orta Decora
You call my name
You walk amongst the late
The seventh veil left at rainbow's end
Into the underworld Cerridwen's domain
Weep for the child inside gone from you
Died away No place in the upper world
But who will nourish our dreams
When laughter expires
To some a nightmare to some a dream
The wise woman takes the bone and points at me
Who am I to be
See my heart is in your hands
See my wings are broken
The fire starts to burn my flesh to the bone
Shall I dare or stay unconscious
Who'll be telling me wrong from right
As shadows fall like leaves in September wind
But when nightmares call we don't persist at all
Retrospective dreams collide 
stranded on that wasteland's shore
As shadows fall
And will my name be called
Up on the mountain bare
In black cloth dressed and desperate fear
As shadows fall
Silence of remembrance fades
I dreamed we once held hands but I awake
As shadows fall
In nomine Magnae Deae Nostrae
Introibo ad altarem
Dominae Inferae
Quae regit terram
I've tasted blood without tongue
My skin shed at your feet
Am I to sacrifice I asked the allknowing crone
Salvation can't be found in here I sadly sighed
Where is the sun Who'll light my day
Where are the stars Who'll guide my way
I try to hide but inexorably
a voice like thunder coming up
And as the midnight sun 
drowns the world in velvet light
I call your name through the ashes of time
Of all transgressions I can't take no more
Deliverance your love is all I implore
As flowers burn I hear the wolves return
At this desolate place
Lost in time and lost in space
Remembrance of a golden age
In these days of yore A magic spell
Was it your name I called
I'll try again
And like a dream
Your loving face
I touch your golden skin just for a while
Entwined we fly through the blackest skies
You smile I take your hand  back home again
Osculetur me osculo oris sui
Quia meliora sunt ubera tua vino
Fragrantia unguentus optimis
Oleum effusum nomen tuum
Ideo adolescentulae dilerexunt te
Trahe me post te
We'll make you pay this time
Rewrite the story
Repent now for your crimes
Break you down
Destroy you
We'll bleed you fucking dry
Bring you down
Dissect you
Feed you your empty eyes
This is the end of all you know
We are strong in number
United by one goal
Our lightning and thunder
We'll cast down on your soul
No longer fit to rule
The time has come to relent
Pathetic creation
Tear down and reinvent
This is the end of all you know
All you fucking know
This is the end
Of all you know
No more false prophets 
We'll burn them one and all
Powerless to stop it
We'll have complete control
Take you down
Despise you
And show you no respect
Smack you down
Defile you
What else did you expect
This is the end of all you know
Push the button
It's time to push the button
Destroying the gap
Between the pauper and the glutton
Crush the atom
Oh God  unleash destruction
Eat the turgid squalor of this creation
In a flash
A blinding white flash
Eliminate the epidemic
Of sentient trash
In a flash
Let all the markets crash
This downfall will lead
To the ultimate clash
BURN Burn it all down
Down to the ground
Reclaim the crown
Tonight we dine in hell
GET DOWN We've come for your kingdom
STAY DOWN Hand over the keys
GET DOWN Won't take no for an answer
Get down there you fuck
DOWN ON YOUR FUCKING KNEES
It's the ultimate violence
It's the ultimate show
You must pay for the crime
Of us needing to grow
There is no one solution
To this shit consequence
We now have to attack you
It's our only defense
BURN Burn it all down
Down to the ground
Reclaim the crown
Tonight we dine in hell
BURN Burn it all down
Down to the ground
Reclaim the crown
Tonight we dine in hell
BURN IT ALL DOWN
Today was a day like no other day
I have had it with this sad hypocrisy
And what is meant to be a civilised society
NO MORE
I won't back down again
A great way is raging in my mind
Ignore what I used to think as reason
And bear the brunt for all mankind
I've fallen down and I'm never getting up again
Apocalyptic HIGH
Laid to waste are all my mortal enemies
I drowned 'em all in a sea of rage and hatred
Losing all was the key to my epiphany
Set free from my overbearing apathy
NO MORE
I won't back down again
A great war is raging on in my mind
Abhor what I used to know as reason
And be the saviour for all of mankind
APOCALYPTIC HIGH
I have fallen down again
I am never getting up again
I have fallen down again
I've fallen down again
I am never getting up again
Apocalyptic high
I've fallen down and I'm never coming back again
An eye for an eye
No more
Great war
No more
To live for
Spewing forth are all these thoughts of anarchy
I can't stop it it's eating up my insides
Raise my fist to destroy this weak democracy
And build a one man autocracy
NO MORE
I won't back down again
A great way is raging on in my mind
Abhor what I used to know as reason
And be the saviour for all of mankind
Apocalyptic high
I have fallen down again
I am never getting up again
I have fallen down again
I've fallen down and I am never getting up again
Apocalyptic high
I've fallen down and I'm never coming back again
And eye for an eye
No more
Great war
No more
To die for
The truth has spoken
Spirit unbroken
Today outspoken
I just want to see God
I just want to play God
I just want to be a God
A perfect storm in a shot glass
And finally you can get a job
In your esteemed leader's entourage
He's not a black lung after all
We're one nation skewered
On a godless prong
Obsessed with beauties rich and rare
We understand no more
Insurgents grinding axes
With infidels
Demons blow out holy candles
We scream blasphemy
A hornet's nest we can never tame
War that cannot be sustained
Diplomacy or surrender
Here's your next dictator
With hand on your heart
And tears in your eyes
You'll defend this sunburnt country
Until someone else dies
No place sacred is a terrorist magnet
The west gettin' high
On the Middle Eastern dime
Has the audacity to deny
A refugee's plight
From places razed
By an axis of evil
We antagonised
And then failed to destroy
With hand on your heart
And tears in your eyes
You'll defend this sunburnt country
Until someone else dies
No place sacred is a terrorist magnet
Invaded divided and conquered
Never allowed to leave it
A war lord's cartel forever laying' claim
To lawless profiteering of the opium trade
Topple the statue
Tear down the flag
Usher in a new muppet
With finger prints up his ass
Howling like lunatics in this place we live
Contraband flowing free
Amongst the spiteful noseless faces
Of the dead reigning supreme
Join our cult
We won't negotiate
Or listen to reason
We'll kill ourselves and hold you to blame
Our ancestors
Each mongoloid generation
Will hold a grudge through centuries
And teach vengeance and hate
Our polluted blood line
A gene pool tepid sterile
Bring it down turn our home
Into a grave with a fuck you tombstone
Join our cult
We won't negotiate
Or listen to reason
We'll kill ourselves and hold you to blame
Oh masters of your domain
We're using your utopia as a cage
We'll bring the temple down on our own heads
Just to kill you our own way
A revenge taking 50 years
You can't forbid us  we're already here
While you graze and congratulate
We're fattening you up like prey
Join our cult
We won't negotiate
Or listen to reason
We'll kill ourselves and hold you to blame
Oh masters of your domain
We're using your utopia as a cage
We'll bring the temple down on our own heads
Just to kill you our own way
Join our cult
Join our cult
Join our cult
We'll kill you all
It's alive
Labs teaming with mad scientists
Playing jigsaw puzzles with genetic experiments
So we rip tear and shred
And create some horrible new shit
And I wonder are we God
Creating mongoloid babies and incurable disease
NO
So concerned about whether or not they could
That they never stopped to think if they should
Cannot see the forest for the trees
And I wonder are we God
Creating mongoloid babies and incurable disease
NO
And I wonder are we God
Creating mongoloid babies and incurable disease
NO
DOWNFALL
Decaying monument to human greed
Assemblyline shut down  rotting decree
The jewel in the crown of our western beliefs
Now plays the dead hand of false democracy
This is the natural order of things
As goes Detroit  then so goes the world
Artificial obsolescence  true essence
So say goodbye to the American dream
Driven to the end of the line
BLEED
All our resources dry
The end is nigh
So long Detroit and so long the world
Global madness
Spreading your disease all over the earth
Back to nature
Lord and master
Feel my rapture
This is the natural order of
Industrial wasteland so rank and obscene
A civilisation corrupt to the core
Tear it all down and wipe the slate clean
This is our new fight  this is our war
Dead arsenal of capitalist greed
As goes Detroit  then so goes the world
Artificial obsolescence  true essence
So say goodbye to the American dream
Driven to the end of the line
BLEED
All our resources dry
The end is nigh
So long Detroit and so long the world
Global madness
Spreading your disease all over the earth
Back to nature
Lord and master
Feel my rapture
This is the natural order of things
This is the natural order of things
As goes Detroit then so goes the world
This is the natural order of things
This is the natural order of things
DOWNFALL
The writing is on the wall
Downfall
Downfall
Back to nature
Lord and master
Feel my rapture
This is the natural order of things
LIES
Tired of the lies from the congregation
Listen up fuckers it's time to be rude
God is nothing more than a human creation
Evolution
This is how we came to be
Mass confusion
Your God Complex a mockery
Blinded by the faith in your own salvation
Ignoring all the facts is a way of life
Selfless but insane is the declaration
Evolution
This is how we came to seed
Mass confusion
Your God Complex a mockery
It's time to put an end to this profanation
By destroying this cognitive exploitation
Wisdom is the key to your liberation
Open your eyes and see the truth
God is a fake
It is a gospel of hate
Annihilate
This disease of the mind
It's time to put an end to this profanation
By destroying this cognitive exploitation
Wisdom is the key to your liberation
Open your eyes and see the truth
Tired of the lies from the congregation
Listen up fuckers it's time to be rude
God is nothing more than a human creation
Belly full of flesh
And blood and bone
I've had it all
But I want some more
Colossal feast
A black mass
Carnivorous lunatics
Witch hunts voodoo
And man eating freaks
Carnivores apocalypse
Auto cannibalistic
Carnallunarfrenzy
Lord of the flies lonely
Kingdom come starving
Eat your heart out baby
Ritual
Blessed tradition
Only once devoured can you be delivered
Belly full of flesh
Guts over flow
Black mass of bodies
Regurgitated souls
Carnivorous lunatics
With hunts voodoo
And man eating freaks
Carnivorous apocalypse
Auto cannibalistic
Blood dripping from your lips
Carnallunarfrenzy
Lord of the flies lonely
Kingdom come starving
Eat your heart out baby
Are you feeling afraid
Do you need someone to blame
Is free speech compromised
When you don't agree
Rage overflowing
Ideas in your brain are congealing
Does the thermometer in your ass
Have mercury rising
Boiled in blood
Are you feeling enraged
Are you happy afraid
Do you live broken hearted
And full of pain
Follow the leader with someone to blame
Lynch mobs and pied pipers
Running haywire at large
Insane
Boiled in blood
He feeds human puppies
From the paternal tit
The symbiotic bond keeps
The fantasy alive
They're weened and you're gone
Alone in your shame
There to begin the new cycle of repeat
You will never learn
A disappointing shit talking fleeting friend
You will never learn
You're God's gift to no one
A junkie to ego
Sometimes in life
You get pissed on
And fucked in the face
To control your own fate
You must first learn from your mistakes
Living in a fantasy
Stuck on repeat
Again you run home
To escape your deceit
It buries it's head into it's own arse
That stinks so good it hides the rotten fact
That it's a liar  now a pariah
You will never learn
A disappointing shit talking fleeting friend
You will never learn
You're god's gift to no one
A junkie to ego
Sometimes in life
You get pissed on
And fucked in the face
To control your own fate
You must first learn from your mistakes
Living a fantasy
Stuck on repeat
Again you run home
To escape your deceit
Gods gift to no one
Gods gift to no one
Gods gift to no one
You're dead to me son
No tear will fall
On the suffering stench
That lay in a heap
As I walk from prison to freedom
Dive for the noose
Dive for the noose
Dive for the noose
They cycle will be complete
Will you ever learn
You will never learn
Will you ever learn
You will never learn
Will you ever learn
You will never learn
Will you ever learn
Not fuckin' likely

Have no fear  never say die
Have no fear we won't back down
United we will never say die
We'll never say die
We'll never back down
We'll never lose sight
We'll never say die
No holds barred brutality
Designed for devastation
Built to last and forged in stone
A solid reputation
Standing tall set to defend
With steadfast dedication
Have no fear we won't back down
United we will never say die
Killed with a knife
You died for a different point of view
The evil judge
He took your life you said too much
They cut your throat
And spill your blood 'cause you betrayed
Their holy words
You never worried and now you're dead
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Fight the lies
Don't be quiet
We will
Tell no lies
No more lies
Thrown into fire
Your written word
They call it crime
No hope for the betrayer
Religious lies
While fanatic preachers scream
And the millions cry
No one used to see the truth
'Cause they're all deaf and blind
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Judged to death
Freedom for
The ones who dare to say the truth
The ones who tell
The stories of hate and love
If we don't care
About the written word today
Then we will lose
A part of our humanity
You wrote a book
You wrote a book with pages coloured
Red like blood
You never thought that it could be yours
As long as if
Intolerance bars every way of liberty
I won't believe in the human race
They are deaf and blind
You man
Lonely man
I know she'll satisfy your needs
Tell her what you prefer
I guess you've had problems with girls
It ain't so easy to
Find the one that will be kind to you
I've got a big choice for you
So choose the right one
To satisfy your selfishness
Can't you feel the pain she feels
Can't you see it in your eyes
Suck me
I don't believe a word
Don't you tell me tales of love
One man buys
And one man sells
Brown skin black hair
Exotic flair
You deal with living flesh
You order feelings for cash
So nice
She looks like a child
Like if they are wares
I don't believe in your tales of loves
The cry
Of the mistreated
The accusations of the one you've beaten
I hope it will
Echo in your ears
Can't you see
The stream of her tears
Your desire
Is her fate
You crush her soul
Without a trace of shame
I just got contempt for you
I don't believe in your Imported Love
Can't you feel the pain she feels
Can't you see it in your eyes
Suck me
I don't believe a word
Don't you tell me tales of love
My heart turned to stone
As I heard the news that day
The bloody game has started
In the eastern world far away
The cry of a million people
Echoed into a void
The arguments of reason died
As the first bomb was thrown
No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
Those who deal
All of you
Who deal with death
On the day of desperation
As the desert sky turned to black
Did you realize what you have done
When you used to deal
With poison gas
A war for oil
And bloodred sand
And Mr President who smiled
At his warmachine performance
And at the thousands who died
No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
Those who deal
All of you
Who deal with death
Sell the gas
History told you what to do
Poison gas
A memory of Nazi's world war two
The innocent
Nearly wiped out by your deadly wares
Industry
The dealers of death
Will we never learn
No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
Those who deal
All of you
Who deal with death
No excuse
No forbearance
Your abuse
Is much too hard
I accuse
No more colour in my life
All empty
Can't face another day like this
I can't stand the pain I feel
In the deep of my heart
The ignorant took it all away
All that had been
All I am
Inspirations
Torn away from me
And in the void
Only grey
Blind my eyes
But I see
Tell me lies
But I know
In this world of despair
Am I just alive to bear
And when I'm gone is what's left
Is there someone who cares
In this world of despair
Am I just alive to bear
And when I'm gone is what's left
Is there someone who cares
No more colour
Emptiness
Can't face another day
No more colour
Emptiness
Can't face another day
She was
One to criticize
She never had been quiet
Never no never compromise
She had rage in her eyes
No trust in no government
Searching for solutions
She thought that she could change the world
Time for execution
Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more
Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more
Down down
Into the underground
And never fight alone
She tried to make peace with a gun
And her heart turned to stone
No dreams
No illusions
And nothing changed at all
Hiding from reality
'Cause she always failed the mark
All those who died
By my gun
By the bombs
I wish all this could be undone
Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more
Wait my friend
I crush you from below
When we meet
you will lie never more
Coldness
A grey and rainy day
She wonders what went wrong
Wasted
Years have past by
She's getting tired of the fight
Now she can feel the emptiness
Deep inside her heart
While she tried to reach the light
She walked into the dark
Like the sun
That burns the desert ground
You leave scars
On innocent souls
You suck their brains out
And then fill them up with paroles
Young boys to tell propaganda tales
Look into these hopeless eyes
As they get raped
By the cameraeye
A young life sold to war
A wasted youth
Searching far a lost childhood
War is lie
War is cruel
War is lie
War is cruel
I've seen a lake of tears
Shed by the mothers
Of the disappeared
A sea of blood
Red as the sinking sun
We cry for children lost
In wars we never won
Cries of pain
That we can't ignore
All around the world when children go to war
So just switch on the news
Or listen to the radio
Look into these eyes
Like into a deep black  hole
I've seen this face
So many times before
Child of Vietnam or any other war
Young boys to tell propaganda tales
Soldier boy
Left to die
War is lie
War is cruel
War is lie
War is cruel
Fly with the wind
Over the land
Like a storm
Wild is your heart
Brave is the horse
That you ride on
No chains no walls
Only the sea
An endless distance
Faithful you stood
There and you watched
The sinking sun
So grateful the land
You held in your hand
You son of the wild
I saw tears in your eyes
Ride like the wind
Over the land
Like a storm
Indian son
You were so pride
You were free
Your pride has gone away now
Wiped out
Torn away
Dropped down
Like a tear
Now you dwell in your dreams
All the beauty I see
All the beauty I feel 
All the beauty I hear 
All the beauty in the world
Ain't nothing compared to you 
I adore you everyday 
I love you everyday 
I got all the time in the world 
To wait for you 
I'm in love with you
Burning so bright but still so fast 
Will it burn out or will it last 
This love feels so right 
So are you ready for this 
I see a star so bright in your eyes 
I feel the love of a dangerous kind 
I try to reach you with my heart 
You know I know you know 
Crave your love
Love me like I love you
Show me your paradise 
Hold me when I hold you 
Desire for you 
Kiss my sweet lips 
Lead me to the sky 
Teach me about all your things 
Your flesh your blood your you 
Tell me my love is enough 
Stop running I'll do
Caress your skin 
Like meadows in the wind 
Beautiful one
As the signs grow stronger 
And our fate clearer 
Take no precautions 
Follow your leader 
As our love grows deeper 
And we fill each other
Still admire the darkness 
Let it become larger
As life drifts further
Our beauty is the core 
Always sighing after
Still I crave more 
As hope alone grows higher 
It struggles to be free 
All that we can be 
Falldemiseall
We'redisguisedgone 
Weep together the rain to come 
Feel at heart the pain is gone
I feel like I am dirt to you 
You hate me cause I love you 
Just tell me why I'm so low to you
Didn't I mean anything 
Your happiness is my sorrow
My sorrow is my way
My life is a failure
Growing bigger everyday 
Does it make you happy to see me sad
To break my heart and leave 
Here we are 
You and I 
In the sun 
In the sun we're gone
My heart is still broken 
Forever my soul is frozen 
Still watching the rain to fall 
Forever standing in the cold all alone 
I'll stay here to the end 
Another day to start 
Another day to break my heart 
With love still no romance 
The fragile pieces of my soul
Belongs to you 
I hate to feel
I wish I couldn't feel at all 
Don't ask why I have to leave 
Don't know why I still breathe 
Don't understand why I'm still hiding 
All my thoughts for you saving my
Love for you 
Once again I'm living inside myself
I'm too tired of this life 
All I need is my big sleep 
You are so far away 
You love someone else 
Another day passed me by 
Another day filled with pain 
You are not here 
You're with someone else 
I love you to death 
You love someone else
So I just wanna die 
Create hate 
I hate myself for loving you
We have touched for the last time
You are long gone in love with someone else
I now fear nothing but life itself
I do not believe in life or in love anymore
The joy I feel are the joys of emptiness
I hate myself for loving you
Noone can see the emptiness in my eyes
Finally there is peace in my soul
To lie dead without a concern  without a tear
You own my heart
And life without you is so imensly painful
my face
your wonderful body and your good heart
You are everything  I am nothing
I want to die
But really  I am already dead
I will not live
Thank you for everything
Every moment you shared 
I appreciated your stay 
Every smile you gave away 
Thank you for leaving 
Now I clearly see the dark
Embraced by agony 
I fear nothing but life 
What's the reason to live if I cannot love 
I can't get over you
What's the reason to live at allBond of two
Wasted
By a word
World of lies
Now dead
Homicide
Of mind
Numb by the shock
Surprise
Drowning inside
A pool of sorrow
Milked out of hope
By those who care
No longer wish to see the sky
No longer wish to live a lie
Fed up with false truth
No more to suffer
Not another day
Fading into the unknown
Bleeding rotting all alone
The fire of life is long gone
This is the Last Dawn
Twisted thoughts
Inside
Trying to hide
Failure on all levels
The mixed elixir
Of two now broken
The one thrives the other rot
One lived on the other never forgot
No longer wish to see the sky
No longer wish to live a lie
Enough with this pathetic life
This Is The Last Dawn Of Me
Slaves we are
Slaves to Pharaoh
We can't see
Nothing but sorrow
''All men born to the Nile will be thrown
Though females will keep living on''
We were made to serve with rigor
Mortar and bricks made us bitter
In Egypt slavery
Pain 400 years
Pharaoh let my people go
Or thou shalt suffer so
Ten strikes upon your soul
'Till the last Egyptian fall
Pharaoh let my people go
Or thou shalt suffer so
First blood upon the Nile
Last your firstborn one shall die
''Let loose your chains of wrath
Upon this foul land
This Is My Command''
My people in pain
My efforts in vain
I yearn for your aid
Show me the way
So god strengthen the heart of the king
For him to feel the pain within
We were made to serve with rigor
Building the pyramids we feel so shuddered
In Egypt slavery
No rebellion 400 years
The angel of death
Passing over Hebrew's houses
Killing the first born sons
To set the nation free
And I stand all alone in a world of darkness
All sanctity is washed away
By crimson storm of false promises
Of human decay
We have betrayed our god
Now we worship the iron sword
We have forsaken the truth
Mislaid by a single word
Told by unseized hunger
For blood flesh control
They have burnt our eyes
They have burnt our soul
Merciless beaten by fear
Cruel lies No saviours in here
I have lost my life I have buried my sons
Turn my blood into wine
And they will pour it into a glass
They'll take a sip
Yet will never know how painful it tasted
Turn my eyes blind
I will wander through time
We were given holy earth
Now it is defiled
The Terror unleashed
The horror is pure
Pain deep underneath
Hidden obscure
The Terror unleashed
The horror is pure
Pain deep underneath
Hidden obscure
We are nothing but ashes
And cold graves of stone
As we keep on wandering
In darkness All Alone
We are nothing but ashes
And cold graves of stone
As we keep on wandering
In darkness All Alone
Off to the battle we go
Without fear
We know
Death is near
''Rain drops upon my companions' heads
Who are covering themselves
And upon the dead
Who are covering no more''
I will not fall 'till I kill
Though nothing but sorrow is real
I will raise up my sword
And kill to serve the lord
Rain upon the battlefield
Lived to see my hopes fulfilled
I have killed to stay alive
Now side by side we'll strive
Oh god salvage my soul
Before the rushing end
Blood rains down from the sky
Cleansing the land
Jehovah's tears falling down
Soaking the pain
Waged the battle won the war
Now we can slowly decay
Awaken from the storm that washed unbelievers
Yet hasn't kept away the sinners
For it all been spoken the same
Therefore all had understood
The human ambition to raise his name
And build a tower that could
Reach the heavens
Rise up high
And touch the light
Upon the sky
To test their power
To test their god
And build a tower
It's head in the sky
For all to see their strength
For the fear of being scattered
Had they enrage their god
Had they forgot all common sense
And so the lord came down from heaven
All charged with his splendouring wrath
Had they enrage their god
And forgot all common sense
For the lord came down with wrath
And with swift punishment
Prevent the humans
The heavens to reach
And deprive them
of One Single SpeechStain my eyes with guilt
One winters day it all be gone
Bless the mournful eve
One secret kiss and shame to feel
The bleak that I must know
And passion lost beneath the sea
For I am the silver blade
To cut you deep and fade with thee
God to raise the weak
Again this rain and hate in me
Grief fall on every man
An endless pain in shadows sleep
Lost within the hateful visions
Strangled child in the crowd of liars
Whores stripping before me
Inside the walls of this mighty castle
The frost bites deep the trembling soul
Agony is poured upon the silent winter
Where are you now my true Lord
White snow like heavens saddest tears
All mercy fading inside the wretched heart
Slay my emotion and cry to my death
Feel the chill inside the desolate soul
Wasteland of frozen thorns
Bear the light the lonesome flame
Into the night to rise the day
Choking fool to gather the rays
Death is love and all in vein
Silent winters day
One touch to see the pain is real
Cry for life once lost
A drop of blood on pure white snow
Sentenced to silence blamed for all sins
Reaching to darkness burning my skin
Saved by no one forgotten instead
One sacred angel one sold to the hell
Rivers of fire will burn
My final damnation to torn
In blindness of joy I reborn
To dream again of my fall
Burning in fever holy I become
My religion is fire endless I become
Devils and angels the pit and the cloud
My ashes and dust feeding the cursed ground
Rivers of fire will burn
My final damnation to torn
In blindness of joy I reborn
To dream again of my fall
Walk with me burn with me
Into this lake of thousand flames
Let yourself to drink my pain
Swallow it up and be empty again
Rivers of fire will burn
My final damnation to torn
In blindness of joy I reborn
To dream again of my fall
From the voice of the beast
And of the broken beggar
Thy ocean shatters the waters spits storm
Bleeding into the heart pure blood
Poisonous nectar gods feast upon
It bleeds into you
Girl has been made for the lust
Womanly virtues are shed with the tears
Oh this torment in passions war
Playful whore sinful bitch your love
Hold her no one else but her
It bleeds into you
For all times that are gone
Close the black eyes of the eve
For the time you spent crying for me
Close the starring eyes and become a fool
For me bleeding
Loneliness emptiness sickness
Merciless bastards vicious dogs mauling
Your flesh holding your breath
Lord please hear the cry of your child
Even if he is filth even if shes a whore
And I will walk in the serenitys meadows
Slipping among the temples of Christ
And I will watch how my ocean enrage
Down on your earth bleeding into your eyes
The devil outside and sorrow enters my home
Waiting so silent and black hours pass
Tearing my mind from my dying soul
They come they go and kill
The wretched shades after the rain
In this world a dying stare
I cant help you to your grave
No one calling my name
Filthy man designed for blame
Reborn once again from the dust
To strive once more for the lust
The devil outside and emptiness rise
Waiting so silent to my demise
Licking my wounds and caressing me
They come they go and kill
The wretched shades after the rain
In this world a dying stare
I cant help you to your grave
Daggers like teeth bites my body
Savaged by their anger and hatred
Scorned by the world to the end
Lock away the silent cry
See the light so deep inside
Whore and liar dressed in blight
Eyes are closed mouth cannot sigh
Tell me all your sins
I will be in your soft dream
I will try all your delights
Then caress your sleeping face
What do you feel when I am inside
In your room resting in your chair
Talking to your cat and ignoring your presence
In your room the pictures of sadness
Hang on the walls hiding the holes
There is nothing to do at your home
But to sit and to stare at your misery
Careless for the lives of the people
Sick mindless bastards young and too old
In their homes in their beds
Filth and ashes from the broken hopes
All are washed away by the tide to the sea
Crushing demons from the deep burning pit
Stand at your doors crawl in your bed
They beg you to tell them a short fairy tale
Before the endless torturing sleep
They are like you I feast upon you
Of what you should not covet cowardly disdain
Wanting to divulge craving to share your exploit
Greed in being the king naive of the penalty
Reveling secrets proceeded to deceive
Never seen it coming blinded by camardine
Trust an afterthought of what would not occur
Reflection powers fury dominating need to act
Desire for revenge strengthening resolve
Fleeing for respite antagonism boiling over
Settling at hand consider your life
Forfeit in every way repugnance in my sight
Must prolong your agony persecution cruelty
Your backstabbing morals have taken away my life
My conduct in your torture must make it worth it
Haven't thought out this process I've undertaken
Misery saturates all know to find me satisfied
There will be no peace for me now
Distrust for anyone I'll ever encounter
Your treachery will die with you
Showing what is prudent
You prove our task
A worthy undertaking funneling your fury
Greed and corruption things that are below you
Open minded fairness
Masses echo truth
We proclaim your heroes citing their humanity
Media slanted bias can't be real this day
It must be coincidence
Why are some misguided
No time to debate anyone who is beneath us
Not in our refinement more like neanderthal
Intellectual obscurity disease of the vagrants
Not for us enlightened the brains in the room
Everyone thinks like me
We must be are own sheep
Silence all our critics
Dissent can't have a place
Exile them underground
Why should are careers change what we believe
The duty to guide the quest of knowledge
Framing facts to ascertain the proper conclusion
Helping the ignorant peasants of the populace
Blameless on the right side
Influence justified
Technological pariah daunting powerful adversary
Taking advantage of the window of dominance
Mesopotamia to Rome earned right of an empire
Inferiority a sickness only cured by ambition
Desire for revenge fucking drive determination
Proof of power eradication assured
Unequaled supremacy fleeting determination
Greek fire spreads panic watching vessels burn
V2's from somewhere horror in the skies
Trepidation over napalm contagious panic spread
Destined to obey or face the vile consequences
Rage replaces righteousness no way to fight back
Rattle the cage of those who feel secure
False belief in strength
Easy way to get dissected
Something more than a saber
Stirs resentment lower existence
Others rise to prominence
Transparent gloating fuels disgust
Resolve of a sickened nature
Pressing to overcome
Indifference a way of life
Fundamental instinct
Occupying fear
Imposing your will on those who can't resist
Predator of hope
Submitting you souls begging for sympathy
Marauder of faith
Anticipation of any thing to help you
Searching for mercy
No pity for you fucking worthless
Foreseen the future coming dismal regret
Selfish disposition paybacks in order promptly
Power control the means of commerce dictate
Predict choose who suffers largely downfall
Guardianship a must regardless of your net worth
Bailouts reign in all manipulate enduring crowd
Boundaries in line unyielding law
Prosperity as a whole oppressing individuals
Merely burdening our future generations
Why should we care
Taxing you to death regulate your life unrest
Ensue
Must show discipline follow the rules in place
They only adhere to you pay or you're condemned
Constant pressure to relinquish more control
Believe
in the promise that they can handle the power
Establishment knows better than you do
They just might fulfill the prophecy
Using influence to take care of you
Limit personal freedoms reimburse combined debt
Trusting fools inflating dependence
Incentive gone to attempt to strive for
Relying on yourself
Giving back clout was not part of
This covenant that masses signed on
Was not signed in blood
Pursuit of a conflict
Respecting no one
The stance of the vicious
Malicious bout condemnation brutal beat down
Hostility ferocious war overwhelming
Trouncing every foe obtainable
Indulging in mindless belligerence
Ordinary pain less satisfying
Searching for significant anguish
Sadistic concept edging towards reality
Man made boundaries pleasing the public
Menacing necessity assaulting rationale
Envisioning agony intention is clear
Impulsive deed aspiration concrete promise
Eradicateagitation remove constraint
Encroach lucidity permeation
Motivation swelling to the surface right now
Stalking feeble prey oblivious of harm
Eagerness to the pretense of an onslaught
Without hesitation to inflict anguish
Passion to hunt down and dissect
No grief involved
Sorrow of others my peak
Fulfilled purpose
Assailing the victim delight
Repulsive pleasure
Pursuing culmination of bliss
Premium brand of rapture
Cruelty not even a thought
Nasty nature is habitual
Ongoing incentive to implement climax
Crushing any thoughts of hope
Beyond stalking the painful interval
Teasing concluded invasion commenced
Chronic motive of smashing into ecstasy
Carrying out the obstinate fantasy
Basking in the triumph
Execution expertise
Cessation at leisure
No urgency abound
Evasion halting the trance
Forgetting promise made in the campaigns
No desire to advance anything but stature
Keeping up the facade reaping all the benefits
Not considered corrupt just shadily comfortable
debates
The celestial altar of fortune
persuading men to maliciously guard
Exchanging ideas assets or support
protecting the culture of greed
Solidifying your place in the institute
circling weapons always on call
Rubbing resentments fanning hostilities
making sure that you are required
Relaxed immorality takes getting used to
Transformation easy tasting the prize
Merit of compensation roughly void
Perverse means to warrant return
Crooked malevolence can inspire some to rise
Above the law untouchable prominence
Portraying the figure the followers adore
Preying on the people you preach to help
Lobbying for earmarks sanctioned for them
Starling revelation entitlement is yours
Dishonesty the tool to keep your pockets full
Fuck them anyway because they'll contribute too
Your enemy swell from apparent voiced weakness
Propaganda offered on a plate you concede
Not wanting to face obvious dangers
Turning your back on rage and hatred
Innocent analysis simple view of the world
Ideological objectives priority over conflict
Burying your head in sand safe and sound
Acknowledgment of the treat you contradict
The way the world should be hollow dream
Strength and power of the hour gone
Will prevail no substitute for gallantry
Courage to face something menacing
Prepared the boldness to confront your foes
Recognize daring to defy your peril
Bewilderment abundant
Among rational witnesses
Pandering your platitudes
Obsessed in the belief
Unfathomable viewpoint needing others' adoration
Mystifying concept compassion keeps you secure
Adolescent notion that philosophy disarms
The pacifist religion perception of the immature
The antiwar constitutes bowing to their dogma
Hijack your defense expose vulnerability
The vice of beseeching gratification in frailty
Further spreading support of vacating campaigns
No burden to explain your puzzling outlook
Must have confidencein their sincerity
You have assurancethe enemy is harmless
They are trustworthydespite the wickedness
It's an illusion
Why defend yourself through dialogue is power
Stated goal your death room for compromising
Start with concession surrendering advantage
Conceding any guilt irrelevant of fact
Open hand of peace commence cooperation
No need for caution now that we are affable
All historical grievance wiped away over night
Astonished by attack considering harmony
Burying your head in sand safe and sound
Acknowledgment of the treat you contradict
The way the world should be hollow dream
Strength and power of the hour gone
Will prevail no substitute for gallantry
Courage to face something menacing
Prepared the boldness to confront your foes
Recognize daring to defy your peril
Requirement of elucidation no options to evade
Modify adapt and change the rules as you please
Treaties of the past can't be found
By constraints
None shall dictate the privilege
Others are devoid of
Ethos of coercion
Subordinates implement all warranted bidding
Requisitions honored securing selfish esteem
Skepticism marred fear of condemnation
Persecuting the chosen for the lack of adherence
Seize consign demand all detail
Lie dispatchdiffuse will convey
Acquiring comrades for the endeavor
Diminish culpability
Quick pick bit by bit
Now sit and drift
Feed is over
Do ya feel sick
A craving so strong
Believe it talks to me
Served as a joker
But I acted like a king
Conversations to myself
Boarder line skitsofrantic
Lost my control and left us in automatic
Or lose me within the panic
I feel invisible
Scrambling Rambling
Too many thoughts
Can't fucking handle em
They're demanding
That I start planning
The mastered the art of dismantling
Its gone past the point of fixation
Now I'm just waiting and pacing
put ya teeth to curb
And stomp with out hesitation
1 2 3 4
I feel invincible
Why
What
Who
When
Where
The questions that go and strip bare
Life is a fucking illusion
It plays fair when you don't care
You get the answers to all of the above
But when you search you find fucking NO love
And it triggers that sense of failure
When you just realize how lonely you are
But everyone can relate
SO WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE NOT TRULY ALONE
The transmissions
To the system Is to satisfy all divisions
Take the time to listen
Twist the systems they will glissin
But keep in mind Are you lying
Ah FUCK
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind
I'M LOSING MY MIND
GET A GRIP MAN
Gotta keep in time
Fucking step in line
NO FEAR IN YOUR MIND
You can do this YEAH
Aw FUCK YEAH
How am I meant to speak without guns
How am I meant to speak without guns
This is a bullshit way to die
My back will be
FUCKED
At 50 and a high chance I'll be blind
But I guess that's just normal life
And I think we're a lot closer to the fine line
Of bringing back a chaos of a life time
Because people can only break so much
Pretending to be happy
When most of us will
Accomplish a whole lot of nothing
So lets just fuck shit up
Cause I've had enough of this no hand touch
I WANT IT ALL
SO BRING IT
I see you probing
Searching for clues
Reaching to the depths
The inside of you
Learning what's behind you
Leaping to the past
Bringing back those memories
You never thought would last
Then it all floods back
But its been a wild ride
Maybe one day you will wake
And it will all be a distant dream
The moment that you are living
Irrelevant
No matter how important it seems
Weeks rinse out the days
And the months turn to years
But your brain holds on to everything
Then it all floods back
But its been a wild one day you will wake
And it will all be a distant dream
There's a war coming and it's up to you
Where it starts
And how it ends that night
Just drop the act and live in mirrors
Now and then it all floods back
And you can say that it's been a wild ride
But one day you will wake
And I swear you will hate every moment
I am truth
I am the liar
Your perception of time
Is the only thing that defines
What you do and how you do it
And round off the minutes
You're left with the hours
And that's all you've been given
So take your chances
Then take some more
For death is not the only pain time can't fix
Regret hurts until we
Learn to cope and set it aside
But it never leaves the back of our minds
It's the scars on your heart
That tear you apart
I'm talking to YOU
Yes
YOU
Whoever is listening through
Take a few minutes to look back
And see the change
I've instilled in you
Don't deny it
For the first time be true
To YOURSELF
For YOURSELF
NO ONE ELSE
BUT
YOU
Were you the glass that everyone saw through
Or were you the bait for everyone to chew
When the devil kicks
You will be on cloud nine
Just the rain that's to come
So you turn to guilty pleasures
When it's just not enough
Are never seen again
Send your god to the lions
And you will know what to do
As it enters your mind
Send your god to lions
I forever cast a spell on thee
For piece of mind
That you'll be fine
From you to me there is hope I get to sleep
And some dreams Its only you that I see
For its only you that I want to see
Please can you let her go
I'm begging you
Stop standing in the blind side
I know its you
One more time
Picture a movie like a bullet in your head
Repeated dreams
That I'm repeating dreams
And dreaming I'm repeating
Repeats in my dreams
Back when we were young
Together we only wanted love
That was all I ever got from you
And though you're gone
IT WONT LEAVE ME ALONE
Think happy thoughts and fly away with me
Just close your eyes and drink
I give up
I'm calling it in
Cause just as I feel whole
The sunlight reminds me Its not real
I brought you back for a sense of understanding
That you are the air to all of us
BUT IF YOU CAN HURT ME
HOW CAN YOU SAY
THAT I HAVE GONE TOO FAR
If you love them Let them go
The hardest statement I have ever known
Cause if you love them
Let them know
I forever cast a spell on thee for piece of mind
That you'll be fine
From you to me there is hope
That I get to sleep
And some dreams its only you that I see
For its only you that I wanna see
Why does everything I ever try to love
Bring me to my knees
Is it against them
Is it them against me
Is it you against us
Is it us against you
Is it all against none
If it gives into some
I am given a choice
Either be it
Harm
Or
Befriend
that's what my conscience said
It's up to you
who do you choose
Be careful where you tread
It restarts and I reset
And if I give you the opportunity
You do it again
You come to me visible in my dreams
and I remember you
Because you are me
And I say so much
Yet I hold my tongue when I am told to
Speak
Take it back
And it takes back
How many times
I've wanted to die
Couldn't add up for the times
I've done right
But still festering
A moral crime
That's never in play
But always on side
Fucking
1
2
3
You better welcome me
On your feet and feel defeat
Cause now we all
We have control
GET THE FUCK OUT
FUCK OFF
FUCK ME
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU
FUCK YOU
FUCK ALL OF YOU
How many times have I wanted to die
Does it still add up right this time
I JUST TOLD YOU TO GET THE FUCK OUT
I try to run
But I never get far
I AM STUCK
And it's the same reason I stay
I wake up prepared to betray the day
Yet the only fucking time I was ever positive
Was when I lost it all
And couldn't give a shit
How do I control
How do I control meParalysed cannot move at all
From the imminent strike of the beast
From the depths of hell the deep blue sea
The demon has come for the feast
Attack is swift attack is fast
Life flashes before your eyes
When the devil strikes there's nowhere to hide
All around shall hear your cries
With crippling pain blood spills from your veins
Its time to face your demise
A thousand knives ripping through your flesh
Through your blood the beast shall rise
Salvation is all that you seek
With every bite the sea starts to change
Your blood shall stain the sea red
Servant of death
Killer from the deep
Your final breath
Death you shall reap
Eyes of black
And a heart made of stone
Shark attack
You've entered the killing zone
Watching over savage grounds
Within his laws you are bound
Pulling strings he makes your every move
Bodies mark your path to take
In these fields you'll not awake
Cut down your final place of rest
In this world he calls his own
The loss begins the seed is sown
The futile battle for your life and soul
Stalking through an unknown land
Your life is taken by his hand
No one can escape the god below
The skies turn red and wait to fall
Dawn of destruction await its call
To darkest black this land falls to its knees
Do or die his only words
Say your prayers can they be heard
In the chaos you find that you are lost
Let the heavens bleed
We hunt for reverence not greed
From heaven we angels fell
Banished to the kingdom of hell
Holy war wages strong
Mankind stands and looks on
Loyalties meaningless
Our faith in you it now turns to dust
In you we trusted
But you condemned us all
In you we trusted
So now your kingdom shall fall
Mankind shall face our wrath
Their burning souls light our path
Blood shall cover the land
Sentenced devastation on our command
Guard your heavens gate
You'll fall regardless of fate
We'll take back what is ours
Paradise forever ruled by our hand
In you we trusted
But you condemned us all
In you we trusted
So now your kingdom shall fall
A dead dawn's mist unearthly cries
From shallow earth the cursed rise
A life of death broke and decayed
They walk again to bleed the day
Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
The periled souls have gained new birth
They march again to reap the earth
Desecration darkest times
The living suffer for their crimes
Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
Trapped by terror hopeless plea's
Last prayer to none fall to your knees
Save one bullet for the end
On bitter peace you can depend
Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
The living dead
The thirteenth strike
The demons come out to play
The witching hour
They hunt for flesh the prey
All hallows eve
The dead shall rise once more
Hell unleashed
This evil beats down your door
Repent all your sins
Pray to the above
For God to save your flesh and your soul
Terror never gives
Delusion never lies
All hallows eve once more gains control
Start to sweat
The blood runs cold in your veins
Afraid to move
Fear takes hold of the reins
On this night
Your loved ones return like before
Run for your life
Your loved ones themselves no more
Repent all your sins
Pray to the above
For God to save your flesh and your soul
Terror never gives
Delusion never lies
All hallows eve once more gains control
Inertia
against all you took comfort from
even the firmest cornerstone
I cannot fill this emptiness
The ground is falling from under me
We lose ourselves in our regret
Were holding on to a memory
I stand before you for all whove ever grieved
and all who have suffered
This too shall pass
Their silence haunts my thoughts no longer
Dearly beloved gathered here
Dearly departed forever near
In hearts and minds of those you leave behind
your names will live beyond your graves
I am the product of everyone Ive ever known
I am the places that they call home
Ive spent my life chasing ambitions
that were just beyond my reach
knowing all my best laid plans
might leave me reeling and empty handed
Vicious circles are a false sense of progression
Every wrong turn one step further from my goal
furthering the distance in my mind
but hesitation is a dead end road
It seems Ive always run away
Turned my back on uncertainty
Never dared to face my own worst fears
until my reflection shows me
My heart will never be another unrequited dream
Searching for so long just to find
what was right in front of me all this time
It takes so much just to open up your eyes
And when you feel like you're alone
Nothing comes of apathy
Stay safe in your skin
You cant ignore the itch that creeps in
Stick to your senses
This flesh a rusted cage now tear it off
Your mouth holds a devils tongue
that whispers liquid lies to thirsty ears
who drink your poison words
Youve always reaped but never sown a single seed
Youll never fucking grow
You will never fucking grow at all
You will never fucking grow
Now I know this time
your colours will fade to black and white
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
Ill web my way inside your mind
Every memory will be laced and tainted
If you were bound to me
youd be my misery but Id be your end
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
Now I know this time
your colours will fade to black and white
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
Itll take some time for every trace to fade
If you were bound to me
youd be my misery but Id be your end
No words that spill from your mouth
could overcome the ringing in my ears
The blood is pounding in my temples
and it deafens me engulfs my thoughts
After waiting and wishing for so many years
I have turned back the clocks
trying to fill the hole that was left
But an empty heart could never fill one so pure
And now Ive seen the end of all Ive known
My chest is sinking like a stone
Ill wait for the numbness to set in
and hope Ill never feel again
Its getting harder to face the truth
but my frustration is fruitless
I cant decide for you I cant decipher you
And as Im getting older Im starting to believe
As the years keep slipping by
This time I wont look back
My heart was always in the right place
And now Ive seen the end of all Ive known
My chest is sinking like a stone
Ill wait for the numbness to set in
and hope Ill never feel
The past has proven through days gone by
those fed by cruel hands
seem to sharpen their teeth for the bite
while below the skin lies potential
to choose a greater path
Realise your actions hold consequence
and for each misguided step you take
someone must bear the weight
Compromise is never something Id take lightly
knowing when our lives diverged my friend
you chose the wrong path
Carve these words into stone
I have waited patiently for this time
I will leave behind a legacy
The weak willed will rupture and break
Compromise is never something Id take lightly
I will be the change that is needed
I will be the foundation stone
This narrative begins at a point in time
not as you were but as what youve become
a brother to all but a son to no one
I was once not unlike you
Benign and beaten down
I scoured the corners of the earth
in search of a better way
and where you found that sinking feeling
thats where I found myself
ensnared within a vacancy that only I could see
Each step I ever took was a vow
never to return to that place I left
in search of what I always lacked
My security
so I made a promise to myself that I wont break
Meet me at the turning point
Ill be waiting there for you my friend
Give me strength
Give me a new mentality
Give me hope
Meet me at the turning point
Ill be waiting there
Give me strength
Give me a new mentality
And give me hopeInertia

And give me hopeMy world seemed perfect
so warm and full of harmony
I saw a future so constantly
But I was blinded by the light
I did not see what was behind
I did not recognize the truth
Instead I put my trust in you
I forgot that trust means pain
I forgot that nothing is forever
I forgot that life's an unfair game
Witch you can't win never ever
I will not recure what went wrong
I will not be a fool anymore
I will not be as blind as before
Never again
After all I'm alone in the rain
but I've learned to strangle the pain
To see my life in a different point of view
I no longer care about you
Do you know the kind of feeling
Which says everythings alright
While you know it's not
Do you sometimes take a look in the mirror
Asking yourself whats wrong
What is true and whats a lie
I remember the day that changed my life forever
I remember the moment that opened my eyes
Since them Im different not the same anymore
I hated myself for so many years
Days in grey senseless hours
There were so many I stopped to count
To save my will to live
I did not see the beauty of flowers
The green of woods the smile of the sun
I was forlorn in agony
I hated myself for so many years
I hated myself for so many years
But the chance of a new life was always near
I can remember times of peace and of complacency
so many people surrounded me my whole life long
but like shadows fear the sun they are all gone
I am lost in my memories of colors and lights
My eyes wide open my blood's running fast
I am caught in delirium am I alive at last
While the world is high on fire
And everything we are used to be
Is close to falling apart
We act like there is nothing
Nothing that tempers delight
Nothing concuss our lives
And forces us to hell
All around me people telling their stories
About how great and selfless they are
But if you need help without reward
Nobodys there no one cares
They always said 'become whatever you want
I will live my life
Without these inner strife
Just be a man of his word
Among this perverted world
Just a few out there will understand my vision
And not many of you deserve my trust
But for those who always stood beside me
I will walk through fire and dust
I didnt see the blue in the sky
Although I knew the sun was shining so bright
And still I hear the call of my inner voice
I still see the shadows behind the lights
Again Im running 25 hours a day
The sins of my past right next to me
Again I know that all this beauty I see
The night falls apart
Colours return to life
Feelings so long forgotten
Fulfil my soul again
I hurt myself today
To see if I still feel
I focus on the pain
The only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away
But I remember everything
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
I wear this crown of shit
Upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts
I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time
The feelings disappear
You are someone else
I am still right here
What have I become
My sweetest friend
Everyone I know
Goes away in the end
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
If I could start again
A million miles away
I would keep myself
So undo yourself and just be
It will all come naturally
This game insanity
Open your mind
Make the connection
What are you wating for
Played out procrastination
Be at one with your heart
In the mirror is where it starts
The future could be so endless
Whats so hard to understand
Let your conscience be your guide
Pass over those who have lied
Make your world clear
Stand up to your fear
It won't be and easyt thing to do
Make and create your own rules
Only you can decide what is best
Now put your life to the test
In the end what matters is
What you decide
Let the genie out of the
Bottle inside
Realize the potential in you and me
This game reality
You get to do as you please
Why is my life for you to tease
I'm trying to cut this chord
Trust is a luxury I can't afford
Thank you for making me feel my pain
Opening my eyes to see I'm truly insane
I breathe out while all breathe in
Is your beginning my end
If I'm the monster waiting to be
It doesn't give you free integrity
I stay up late at night thinking
About what you said
What right do you have to play
With my head
I try hard not to hear your voice
Same room no choice
Another chance to fail
Is wisdom just another name for hell
I still hear the words you speak
Enter the shadow of the weak
Uncertain the blur in my eyes
I search the truth it's all lies
I tried to ignore it all
The weight brought me to a fall
All the guilt and the shame
It's us who are to blame
There was no excuse
For your life to abuse
Played the executioner
Guilty of legal murder
Thoughts of nothingness
Feelings of emptiness
Gray clouds hang over me
Images of what came to be
The pain I feel I can't hide
It hurts to cover up what's inside
I wish I could take it back
Seeing your eyes rool into the black
Who were we to decide your fate
Told you we loved but all was take
Mourning again it's a loss
Shoul've done better whatever the cost
We let you down in the worst way
All of this is why I'm saddened today
In my world there's cause for alarm
When I watched you die in my arms
All of this is making my soul bleed
All I ask of you is will you forgive me
Every day I fall beneath
My dreams so out of reach
The goals we all wish for
Better future nothing more
I feel so distraught
When my lessons don't get taught
Amused by what I put myself through
Regression is nothing new
As I keep wondering
There's got to be something
Do you feel better when you loose again
Are you afraind of what you might win
I am searching
I get no feeling
Something is tearing me
No peace I struggle eternally
My past is meaningless
Your present is emotionless
Our future is bottomless
Nothing more that makes sense
I see everything yet I see nothing
I hear everything yet I hear nothing
I feel everything yet I feel nothing
I live everyday and yet my life is nothing
Trying to get through to you
Simmering with a dejected view
Thoughts get washed out nothing I can do
Straining so hard for my aims
End up feeling just the same
Whats the matter change of heart
Too scared to finish what you start
What I want I can't have
Thinking about it makes me sad
Are the answers sought
Have my feelings been bought
You represent something
I can't ever have
Because your miles away
From my grasp
Leave me in my loneliness
Can you touch me
Ignoring my distress
Can you hear me
As you pull down the blinds
Can you see me
Ignoring all the signs
Can you feel me
Doubts come from behind
Waiting for the outside to shine
But it never does come
Not after what you have done
Reality sets the ride
I took a peek outside
Quickly I turn away
Sometimes I shake
My feelings make my heart brake
Sealed myself
The doors are locked
The curtains closed
I turn my back
The truth erodes
I sit quetly
With my face in my hands
Patiently waiting
Draining out like hourglass sands
Memories forgotten
Forfeit my soul
Can't seem to break this
I refuse to let it go
I wasn't prepared
In truth i was scared
My life was given
I cried but you didn't listen
I'll always be there for you
I heard you say
I waited forever on that long autumn day
Your poisonous promises
Killing of my innocence
Eternally running from responsibility
Thanks for that lethal dose of pain Daddy
All day I waited on seventeen
Something special became a bad dream
Was it in your nature to do what you did
I could not understand any of this
I was just a kid
Was it in your nature to push me away
No father to help show me the way
Was my birth an intrusion
I see you live in illusion
Yes I waited but you never came
My life was never the same
Is that what you had in store for me
Scarred for ever emotionally
Hours I watched the cars go by
That day a part of me died
When you die you'll die alone
Just words from a son you've never known
I know no joy
Only sorrow and pain
I have evertying to lose
And nothing to gain
Once I stood so very tall
Now I feel I'm nothing at all
As i search this quest gets shorter
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger
Forever fading losing my grasp
I wonder whos having the last laugh
Each night I sleep as if it were my last
I tire of living out lifes' task
I feel I can no longer hold on
So it's you who must stand up and bne strong
These things I ment to tell you
With my own voice
But I was hurting so much
I didn't have a choice
There's nothing left for me now
You must carry on somehow
You may not understand
But it will come to you
Just what I've been going through
Deep in my heart I know I'm good
Sometimes I don't see it even if I could
I have to do this to be free
I can't take any more misery
Overcome these thoughts that surround me
I can feel myself drowning
There's so much I could never live up to
I never ment to be a burden to you
I can see you as the tears swell up
Find your strenght don't ever give up
These questions I long for
Which were never sought
This isolation
Further spreads the rot
Release these chains that
Kept me all in a bind
Reliquish myself to
Have peace of mind
My life's been punctuated
My price for hesitating
Total selfdetonating
There's no other reasoning
To rid this imposter inside
Time to say goodbye
I apologize for putting you
Through all this
Deep in my heart
Who I always will miss
Take care so long miss you forever
Goodbye
I have this urge to die
Another plane to the other side
Look at my life
Nothing left inside
All my frustrations
I could not find a release
My death will come
At great ease
I've felt i've never belonged
Doesn't matter when i'm dead and gone
Life is no longer a wheel
It's time to give you the real deal
From the cradle to the grave
I've never had my way
No one will miss me anyway
The method will be of my own design
Don't be sad at what you're going to find
Got tired of hurting in this world
I don't want to live anymore
Watch myself spill out on the floor
Really it's all for the best
Gotta get a god
Then you found faith n we wonÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t part
Gotta get a god
God  My god  God
You got your god I got mine

Guidelines to live memorized rules
Become a phanatic 1 suckers tool
God  your god  some god
God  why gods  no god
Gotta get a god
All hate  war now  before
Still your highscore
Underpaid in the shade I got better things to do
Like many kids I had my vision
What to become my future occupation

You really brought this upon yourself
You knew itÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½d come to this
Once so alive but now too dangerous to kiss
Too damaged and infected face your/the world
The bottomless pit coming your way
No air to breathe judgementday
The bottomless pit coming your way
ItÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½s getting hard to breathe
I got a bunch of whitecoats on my tail
And with their service I canÃÂ¯ÃÂ¿ÃÂ½t fail
Another bloodtest another session
Still on the juice How about aggression
They want to make a man out of me
As if I owe a cent to this society
They are the reason for the so called anarchy
Shrinxntherapists are on my back
This hellhound stray is fucking hard to track
This bloody crap is not about to change
I see blackeyed action nonstop kickin' through
Another 1 buysthedust loud mail lunacy
Another 1 buysthedust
Loud mail coming in  Hi male coming up
I cut myself bloody I drank myself sick
I smashed my place up did I change anything
The ugly taste of someones tomorrow
The ugly taste of the black bloody hell
I drove somebodies car and bought myself an axe
Wacked a lot of brain wasted a lot of time
who the fuck reads signs
The ugly taste of
Got myself evicted lost my drivers license
Wacked a lot of brain wasted a lot of time
My fucked up past is someones tomorrow
The ugly taste of Enjoy
How much more can you take
Of the hate they create as they lie to your face
What the fuck can you do
More dollar signs
In their golden mines/minds
See the ego shine greed makes you blind
day of the rope day of no hope
Smoke gets to my head as my whites turn red
Slow another show in the temple of thoughts
Sleep not mine to keep but fuck knows I fought
Cool creative and damn collected
Cold Cold cheap and disconnected
From hashish to ashes in dust we crust
Lost Profits POD Korn some 41 Mushroomheads
A lullaby soundtrack for the ones born dead
Look dumb act weird ripped shirt ohdear
No hope No future No balls  that suits ya
On MTV I rest my eyes misery in disguise
Makeup tune down new wig
I thought was mine
Black burnt shell  Frozen inside
Disgraceful  All cold inside
Seeing myself so dark and so serene
My world seems to crumble before my eyes
Crumble into eternity
Black burnt shell  Frozen inside
Disgraceful  All cold inside
Sorrowladen and too weak to let it go
Crash and burn this is a deadend
Seeing myself so dark and so serene
My world seems to crumble before my eyes
Crumble into eternity
Black burnt shell  Frozen inside
Disgraceful  All cold inside
Black burnt shell  Frozen inside
Disgraceful  All dead inside
Hail to thee thou new moon  jewel of the night
Hail to thee thou new moon  mother of the stars
There I shall be again by the beating drums
Hail to thee thou new moon  daughter of the sun
The equinox of the night is here 'pon everyone
To the other world
There I shall be again by the beating drums
Where the spirits ride the winds
And walk on
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
When is this spirit to be reborn
To reach the beauty of forevermore
Baptized in fire selfslain by thought
Immortality is what I have so long sought for
When is this spirit to be reborn
To reach the beauty of forevermore
Baptized in fire selfslain by thought
Immortality is what I have so long sought for
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
A midnight in the garden of evil
And the Sun it burns so bright
I have travelled through strange dimensions
These are the times of stranger aeons
And the world will burn
What you abstain to end your life
Should I kill you before the life does it itself
Your selfconsciousness can't accept your life
What seem to be The death of vanity
The mask that covers up your selfesteem
Is the one created by your sanity
The mask that covers up your selfesteem
Is the one created by your sanity
I feel that I have gone too far
I will greet the eternity for you
As I turn away
What once was shall never be again
Immortal I lust unto the eternal end
What once was shall never be again
Immortal I lust unto the eternal end
Born of thunder amidst the pouring rain
I shall be once again
Where angels fear to tread
Ravens rule their kingdom
Ebony towers scarlet jg
Before the greatest battle all mortal flee
The winter of thousand years
vanish all weak mortality
I fell on my knees without mercy
I could feel the noose strangle me
My eyes couldn't see I couldn't speak
When the season of withering came on to me
Be smothered in pain and all in vain
Do you really think you are sane
Be the one to yearn you won't learn
As the season of withering comes on to you
Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again
Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again
Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again
Autumn fire burns in the woods
Season of wither has come again
The darkness shrouds my day
Season of withering has come again
Shrouded in mist I stand here above the world
After the clash after the glow of war
And no one to shed no tears for humanity
Sky is burning trying to burn away
Of humanity
There's nothing but grey all life is lost
There's nothing but grey faded into grey
But the winds are the only ones to howl
But the winds are the only ones to howl
all life is lost faded into grey
And it all turns to grey
The skies are open smell of a danger in the air
Adventures calling beyond the faraway stars
No place to call home in underworld or sky
Living on the edge looking danger into the eye
Flying towards the stars so bright
Straight into the heart of the night
Wings of darkness carrying the spirits of us
The skies are open for atomic Vikings to roam
No place is safe from us in underworld of sky
The new experience you made is digging your mind
Surrender to us leave the past behind
Here's the New Machine
We are your machine
Doomsday is near there's no place to run or hide
We're devastating got no glory got no pride
Blasting through your ears with power and might
No reason to defend just join our fight
Back on the streets running out of control
Mind eating beats will conquer your soul
Up from the ashes and back on the feet
Don't take us too serious we don't even do
The power is with us but we're never true 
I can't believe all the things that you do
Don't start living
Turn on the TV await something new
Give it to me
Switch off your brain let the pictures flow on
Hypnotizing
Flickering reality
While your own life is left undone
YOU HEAR YOU FEEL 
YOU SMELL YOU SEE 
YOU TALK YOU THINK
MY FRIEND YOU DIE YOUR LIFE
I can't believe all the things that you say
Don't start stumbling
Got no intention or sense anyway
Fool on duty
Degenerated disciples of lies
Don't ask questions
Keep on believing
What you see is always true and right
You die your life
Manipulated poor existence with no aim
You die your life
Isolated mass obedient and tame
You die your life
The ultimate religion spreading true belief
You die your life
Friendship seems to be a foreign word for you
Every second somebody gets hurt
You rape their feelings every time you're around
You make a hush of every smile next to you
Because you're an asshole so don't waste my time
You're just an asshole you don't change my mind
Pray for salvation on earth 
Admit the mistakes you made 
And then show remorse
Pray for salvation but redemption is far 
This is a warning don't forget who you are
Every time it's the others fault
When you are screaming your inner self appears
You're just jealous of the others' pride
Because you're an asshole so don't waste my time
You're just an asshole you don't change my mind
You can't change my mind
Pure black surrounding me my eyes opened wide
The time has come to leave this ordinary life
Your call from down below thy will shall be done
Hear my call pass the gates
Feel my warm embrace take your father's place
Leave the world you will learn
Merciless regime honor to redeem
Darkest visions coming true
Eternal plagues wait for you
A voice in my mind imagination or real
The descendant 
Something inside confusing my conciousness
You're the descendant
Heir to the throne receiving the burning crown
The descendant 
The future of hades
You're the descendant
The heritage of hell the fallen angel's son
Two thousand years of doom I will overcome
My father you're too weak now I'm in command
The emperor of hate they'll suffer until the end
Leave the world you will learn
Merciless regime honor to redeem
Hear my call pass the gates
Darkest visions coming true
Eternal plagues wait for you
A voice in my mind imagination or real
The descendant 
Something inside confusing my conciousness
You're the descendant
Heir to the throne receiving the burning crown
The descendant 
You're the descendant
Strong metal that surrounds me
A thousand feet down below
Brilliant brains in strategic games
And I am the host of the show
Rise the curtain sing my song
And dance to my cruel melody
The call for peace is the hymn of the weak
Miserable tunes in my ears
You're deaf dumb blind
You waste my time
Cause I decide
I won't wait no more so
Raise your fist to heaven
You are marching off to die
War's the only way to peace
This life is yours but this world  is mine
This world is mine
After this bittersweet taste of my might
There's only silence around
Don't you dare to say any word
Just got permission to think what you want
My life's too short to reach for the stars
I know some day my time will come
Still I reign my democratic dictatorship
For this time history will be done
You're deaf dumb blind
You waste my time
Cause i decide
I won't wait no more so
Raise your fist to heaven
You are marching off to war
Praise my name and play my game
And those who do not follow i ignore
Forget what you've been taught
Cause i'm the one who's right
War's the only way to peace
This life is yours but this world  is mine
This world is mine
This fuckin' world is mine
Only mine
11 am and a new day begins
A hammer in my head smell of death in my mouth
Life returns to my body again
Yellow cab I remember the case
A murder and a blonde loads of money and me
No solutions only questions confusing my brain
Take the hand to the bottle and cheers 
So many chicks beside me when I ride the tube
So much money awaits me if my numbers appeared
Who's the man behind the mask 
Who put the poison in the flask 
Who you gonna call A man like me 
No idea no idea 
Crime scene but I cross the line
I'm afraid another unsolved crime
So much honor and glory will never happen to me
Take the cattle chicken pigs
Feed them with a bonemeal mix
How wonderful their eyes begin to roll
Bizarre dance on the funny farm
Hole brained beef won't do no harm
What does a cow a brain need for at all
Infected 
Take the incomplete creation
Eliminate abomination
You are perfect and so the world should be
You tinker at what you don't like
To solve what's hidden deep inside
A hail to cosmetic surgery
Infected 
Take off make the space your own
Calculate your way back home
Through the journey I'll be by your side
And if you dare to find a place
To haunt and finally to waste
I start the epidemic then
And get the whole wide universe
Infected
Start up the engines when the sun goes down
Still feel the heat around
A perfect fusion made of man and machine
All systems checked the orders clear
At last all doubts have disappeared
Among the smell of sweat and gasoline
In here to be just you and me
Together we will fight the abstract enemy
I draw the lines into the sky
With best regards it's time to die
So get prepared and kiss your ass goodbye
Eyes of the world  follow the action
Watch every move  war tv
Out in the fields  be my companion
Whipe out them all  war tv
My missiles hit the target exactly done my work
Mission accomplished as the fires blaze
No fake it's life what you have seen
Now pan the camera right to me
So that the world can see the smile on my face
Gunfire we're hit pure blood i spit
The bastards cracked us up we're going down
They drew a line into the sky
With best regards it's time to die
I get prepared and kiss my ass goodbye
They broke my will i'm not the heroe anymore
This ain't the picture you've been waiting for
Down on my knees your gun released
World's on location when they blow away my head
With best regards it's time to die
Stay tuned and see another try
Of entertainment on your war tv
I am the one who's near beside you
When night devoures day
Just wait a few more hours
Your life will fade away
You thought that life could last forever
What a fatal fallacy
Confronted with your unknown inner self
I lead you to your destiny
I'm closer than your skin the enemy within
Flowing through your veins into your brain
Devastating all I get you under my control
I will cause you sneaking endless pain
Endless pain
What would you pay to sleep just for a moment
To get a rest from being scared
I will not leave I blur your every senses
I hit you when you're unprepared
When I behold the fear within your eyes
It fills my soul with lust
I know the pounding of your poor heart
Is gonna end up in the dust
I'm closer than your skin the enemy within
Flowing through your veins into your brain
Devastating all I get you under my control
I will cause you sneaking endless pain
Endless pain
Now that your pulse is growing faster
You feel that I'm so close
That rushing in your ears I love it
Adrenaline overdose
Your shivering body your staring eyes
Sweat running down your spine
To realize that you are me
Total collapse of your mind
I'm closer than your skin the enemy within
Flowing through your veins into your brain
Together we enjoy your endless pain
Endless pain
Tell me why I stand here again
I cannot seem to make up my mind
And now I'm right where I wanted to be
But still I find it hard to smile
I wait for the euphoria to come
Maybe I've got it all wrong
I'm stranded
On the fields of life
No
Not again I said to myself
But there you were and shook me around
Dragged me out from the cave in my mind
A place I wanted no one to find
Destiny has always had a way with me
Opened up my lying eyes and made me see
I hope you hear me
When you come too near me
I don't know how to handle desire
On the fields of life
I don't know where to go
On the fields of life
I don't know where to turn
On the fields of life
I don't wanna lose what I have found
A light in the darkness around
Why can't I let go of the fear
And let all my doubt disappear
I depend on the balance divine
Always so hard to combine
I hate the insecurity inside of me
I will always be my biggest enemy
I will always fear me
Cause when no one steer me I will go
Into the fire alight
On the fields of life
I don't know where to go
On the fields of life
I don't know where to turn
On the fields of life
I don't wanna die alone
On the fields of life
It' the twinkle of frustration in your eyes
That reveals your illusion
A life built on bundles of lies
For some time I believed you
And the stories that you told
It really was a glamorous display
Now your fortune is long gone
Reality is heading your way
Trial and error without reason or rhyme
Trial and error takes us further apart
Never learn anything from mistakes or by heart
But you're not so keen on taking my advice
You're so blind you don't notice
You make the same mistake twice
Trial and error without reason or rhyme
Trial and error takes us further apart
Never learn anything from mistakes or by heart
Mountains of failure
You're standing on the top no one can see you
Mountains of failure
You're standing on the top no one can hear you
You are stuck in the circle chasing yourself
With no way out there's one thing you must learn
At the end of the day
There's no more bridges to burn
Trial and error without reason or rhyme
Trial and error takes us further apart
Never learn anything from mistakes or by heart
Let's try again
He always tried to seize the day
Now he let it slip away
Shining sun or falling rain
Doesn't matter anymore
Another boring day begins
Already knows how it will end
And now he's losing faith in you
You used to guide him
You showed the way the he should follow
He built a world upon your promise
He would be saved
He's all alone no one to hold
When the nights are long and cold
He prayed to you for some relief
For some reward for his belief
He tried so hard to do it right
Saw the world in black and white
But now it's fading into grey
He feel temptation
He's never had a night of passion
Or numbed his mind with the firewater
Never felt alive
Oh he's lost again
Now the world will see
Another soul led astray
Another destiny thrown away
The one way ticket in his trembling hand
Is the testimony to the tragedy
Was he never meant to be
never meant to be
He boarded the plane towards the end
A grave among the neon lights
Realized his wildest dreams
In a drunken hazy night
He sold his life and the money made
Spent it all on the last crusade
His celebration of the end
The one's who found him
Said he smiled and looked so peaceful
And in his hand he held a letter
It said No one came
I hope you're happy in the world beyond
That you find what you need
That you get what you want
The world has lost again
And no one will see
Another soul led astray
Another destiny thrown away
The final letter in his lifeless hand
Is the testimony to the tragedy
Was he never meant to be
I still feel your presence
Although you're not here
Your voice your smile and laughter
Is now replaced with fear
I'm holding on to memories
That slowly fade away
Force my self to hold on
And to live for one more day
Time is a twofaced creature
Of mercy and of pain
No way to control it
All efforts is in vain
Destiny is lawless
It makes up its own rules
Together they are mocking
And make us look  make us look like fools
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
And be a part of this world once again
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
You held the fate of my life in your hands
I thought I could handle everything
I thought that I was strong
Life was running flawless
And nothing could go wrong
But I froze when I saw it coming
Oh the turning of tide
Washed away in sadness
With no place for me to hide
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
And be a part of this world once again
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
And be a part of this world once again
Give me reasons to leave
Turn around and walk away
Give me reasons to stay
You held the fate of my life in your hands
Now I Am here again
So tired of pretending
I know what my life is about
Trying to find a way
The almighty solution
Before I have run out of time
I still remember when
I believed that the fire
Inside me was destined to burn
Every day and night
For as long as 'I'm breathing
Now only the ashes remain
Always seek always speak
Of the moment all comes together
Am I back right on track
Are the changes made to the better
I hope that what will end all this confusion
The conclusion
I am just healing the wounds of my soul
healing the wounds of my soul
Maybe I'll never learn
From all the mistakes I have done
Since the day I was born
Maybe I'll die alone
Surrounded by memories
Of all of the love I denied
Always seek always speak
Of the moment all comes together
Am I back right on track
Are the changes made to the better
I hope that what will end all this confusion
The conclusion
I am just healing the wounds of my soul
Here in the darkness
I wait for the light to arise
Here in the darkness
Will someone please show me the way
To reignite the spark
And let me glow again
Here in this empty room
In my tower of sorrow
I decide to start over again
I hope to find someone new
That will search for the pieces
And try to recover my heart
Always seek always speak
Of the moment all comes together
Am I back right on track
Are the changes made to the better
I hope that what will end all this confusion
The conclusion
I am just healing the wounds of my soul
There's a place that no one knows of
A safe haven filled with bliss
It's far away I'd like to stay there
And make my clouded sky clear up
No tears no sorrow
In my hideaway of dreams
Suddenly my pain has turned into laughter
And soon reality comes crawling again
Disabled as I lie you enjoy life
you enjoy life
There's no light where I'm abandoned
I've lost all track of time and space
No friendly face is recognized here
Behind my eyes I'm still awake
Suddenly my pain has turned into laughter
And soon reality comes crawling again
Disabled as I lie you enjoy life
you enjoy life
I'm stashed away to waste away
I won't be preying on your mind anymore
I will forgive you will forget
What goes around will come around at the end
Suddenly my pain has turned into laughter
And soon reality comes crawling again
All my life
You have been here beside me
Through the days and nights
We were as one
Now you're gone
I'm sorry that I couldn't see
That I treated you wrong
That I drove you away
Oh my love don't leave me here alone
Oh I cannot make it on my own
Without you all I am will slowly fall apart
Now and then
I feel you inside of my soul
Like a flash of light
In the dead of night
Everyday I hope I will meet you again
And invite you to stay
Forevermore
Oh my love don't leave me here alone
Oh I cannot make it on my own
Without you all I am will slowly fall apart
Then there is moments just like this
Times that I so dearly miss
When you return in all your glory
A piece of paper and pen
Some time alone and then
We are immortalized forever
I beg you
Don't ever leave for good
Nothing can move me when I'm fading
Slowly turning into air
No one can see me when I'm hiding
Somewhere beyond reality
I'm drifting away to my own landscape
Floating on the rivers of despair
I let it slip away
I am safe here
Inside my white darkness
Problems don't bother me in here
All alone here a world in white darkness
The one place to where I always will return
Always will return
I won't deny that I am tempted
To stay here and to never ever leave
But to go where for good I need a reason
A battle impossible to win
Nowadays I'm stronger feeling more secure
Dealing with my problems that I've had before
I've finally found the harmony I need in life
I need to be awake don't let it wither away
We all have dark days in our lives
Any loved ones will believe him
Before we die
I am safe here
Inside my white darkness
Problems don't bother me in here
All alone here a world in white darkness
The one place to where I always will return
Always will return
Now I know nothing's what it seems
Money talks
Now I see religion screams
I believe in what I hear and what I see
and in myself the king of my own destiny
The angles of heaven the demons of hell
are creatures we had to create
Why are you scared to see who you are
and be in control of your life and fate
I can't see why you choose to dedicate
all your life to assure you enter heavens gates
I can't say that I am right and you are wrong
but common sense can tell a truth or two
All those lives lost in battle of belief
It's all because you were born to believe in
different lies
The angles of heaven the demons of hell
are creatures we had to create
Why are you scared to see who you are
and be in control of your life and fate
If god is above us and Satan beneath
we all belong here on earth
Cause no one is good or evil to the core
We all have our halos and horns to bear
I told you my secret you said it would be safe
You would never show and no one was to know
Sharing my burden giving some relief
That was my true belief but the I was deceived
Kissed me like Judas and poisoning my heart
That's what you've done to me
I want all of the world to see
Oh I wish we'd never met
It's time to forgive now it's time to forget
Then these feelings would be gone
It's time to look forward it's time to move on
I'll never know the answer why
Never know why
Don't need your confession or any lame excuse
Because what goes around always comes around
A line that you can't walk
Writhing on the floor
You won't be aware 'til it's too late
Cause you never look around
You're like a deer in the headlights baby
Start a fire and you can never put it out
You're burning up in the blaze you started
I want to see you face down
Because I know that you play that part so well
At our wake the casket is open ready for viewing
But we are still moving
Already we smell of rot
There will be no comeback
No coming back for any of us now
No way out
Don't you realize there is nowhere you can hide
No way you and I will ever be done
We're never apart
Whatever you're doing
We will always cross your mind
You were young and now you pay the price for her
I don't know your name but I know you
Do you lust for fame or forgiveness
Well I'll give you everything you want
Well I'll give you anything you need
Now you've stuffed your throat
You've walked on your burial ground
Oh you'll draw the crowd
With honey porcelain skin and crystal baby blues
You wear your skin so fresh
Your smell intoxicates
Little starlet
Got so much salt from your lies poured into me
You didn't see yourself dead already
So full of with every breath you breathe
Long as it feels right
I had gotten frozen by the way you walked
It's a coverup
I know everything
You're made for letter fame
Regret is part of your name
There's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted to feel
It's what you're dying to feel
Check out your face on the wall
Like what you see
I'm sure you see yourself oh so unique
You're just a sucker for the flame of the week
Nothing is what you think
I could never have
Standing here with you
One regret
One mistake
Nothing we could do
After this is done
You can go your way
Don't forget
This is how
Everything should be
Don't you ever go
Now
You laugh forever you laugh
The winner and the best man
Corrupter
Shapeshifter
Your voice is the sound of nothing
Butcher of every artform
Peddler of deceit
Watching the hour hand drag
Destroyer of the past
We're smart enough to say we're sorry
Not smart enough to start again
Dancing in death's illusion
The pride before the fall
Candy for the children
Give it to them all
Fallen angel how you've changed
Poison runs through your veins
You were never a saint but now you're a sin
Spoiled rotten from within
Who clipped your wings so useless
Cut them yourself
Chewed off your own
Good thinking
Through the fever
Not the first one
Not the last one
I'm not sorry for you
And I thought you knew the same
I know truth will set you free
Cracked and crazy baby
My thick tongue hangs down low to the ground
Licking up the sweat coming off of her heels
She wants my teeth to wear
She wants my hell to bear
Well missy it's a lock for load
If you wanna grind hips don't do it alone
Don't save no dance no not for me
Just cut me out
Well you thought you'd tear my skin from bone
Just cause it was cold and you needed a coat
Oh you're getting so sleepy tonight
And you wanna go home but you don't have a ride
No time just taste won't touch for free
My salt your sweet
And you were there
I see right through you
We never even noticed that
There always was a reason
That we were never meant to be left alone
This feels like neverending
You are only the faded star of my design
Walk forth
You're the fulfillment of a fallacy
A creature from fantasy
Don't think that you ever knew me
Don't you ever see
Don't you ever see
Won't you ever see
You and I will never be able to end this
You say someday we can start up again
Without a plan no sign of the pressure
I say you're crazy
I hope you see my face in the mirror
You will never learn
You're forever dead to me
Won't you ever see
Your shadow
I made a big mistake
With you tonight
The way our insides burned
Like moths flying to the light
I know the games we play
Give us a way
A way for us to see if we still feel alive
We'll never feel like anything is wrong
The tragedy is not just our own sad song
Walls we have built and bridges we have burned
Deeper the hole the farther we feel from harm
Time is always right behind us
Like the lamb under the gun
I'll hold on to this forever
This is never long enough
Stumbling over dead forgotten
Catch you and the secret falls away
Falls away
You were drunken from delusion
Slipped and so the secret fell away
Fell away
I see you
Tears in your eyes
Yeah this party is a bore and you're the joke
Me and you
We are the light
Sit with me
Give me your hand
You should go your way
You are no friend of mine
Life still lives on lives
Red sea inside these walls
Commerce is your god
Cannibalistic flies
Monarch of your womb
Messiah of your thighs
How sacred is the web that must be spun
Your taste is on the tip of every tongure
Down lets stay down
Take me all the way
All the way down
Shout shout out loud
Make us proud for days
All the way down
Give to fire
Beyond the soul desire
Our trust runs out tonight
Everything we said dissolves
And now we say our last goodbye
Nothing to resolve
I never imagined you'd turn into this
But then the end was always close
We could feel it all along
Don't you know where
We could hide the lies
You were a mouth without a heart
An action without meaning
And you walk afraid
Reaching for the hands that turned closed
Quickly in my race
The music is very strong
I feel full of rage
With the ones that reject my dreams
I open my eyes and I feel metal
Flow all the veins of my body
The beatings of metal give me the life
My heart lives for metal
Long road traveled through
Thousands of experiences lived
My heart of metal will not die
Everything that I feel is true
Every day I need
My dose of metal
Wherever it is
Metal will never die
The headbangers are all together
The first riff will raise them
Will flow for all the veins
The dose of metal to live
True friendships began to grow
All met by a single reason
The love to metal united us
Forever to our final day
Every day I need
My dose of metal
Wherever it is
Metal will never die
Quickly in my race
The music is very strong
I feel full of rage
With the ones that reject my dreams
I open my eyes and I feel metal
Flow all the veins of my body
The beatings of metal give me the life
My heart lives for metal
Long road traveled through
Thousands of experiences lived
My heart of metal will not die
Everything that I feel is true
His soul is full of revenge
The pain drove him crazy
With his axe in hand
He will destroy you quickly
He lives hidden in darkness
Nobody knows when he will attack
The hatred doesnt leave him to see
He attacks without mercy
If he traps you are lost
Because he is the skull breaker
The murderers of his family
They walk along the streets
Without knowing who waits
Sooner or later will find them
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
The insanity says him that is a play
A bloody and macabre play
Will he continue killing people
Will he continue breaking skulls
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
He strikes your body
You'll pay being guilty or not
Has begun a bad day
With the fists in high
The adrenaline is running
The adrenaline is burning
All in the streets
They show rage and violence
They accuse all the abuses
They want the head of the damned
Here we are
In the middle of chaos
The riothas begun
A true war
Both parts attack
Not measuring the consequences
Only blood and pain
The city is ruined
The tranquility erased
All will begin again
A great reconstruction
Here we are
In the middle of chaos
The riothas begun
Has begun a bad day
With the fists in high
The adrenaline is running
The adrenaline is burning
All in the streets
They show rage and violence
They accuse all the abuses
They want the head of the damned
Here we are
In the middle of chaos
The riothas begun
I have the power and force
I have a place injured in my soul
My dreams are like the fire
My dreams devastate all in their road
Destroying and devastating
Doesnt matter to me the pain that caused
I feel as my own fire burns me
My only worry is to fight steel with steel
Our projects and illusions
Our families and lives
They are in a latent danger
Each second of life to be the last
Power of fire
You burn our lives
Power of fire
You fight with the steel
Our projects and illusions
Our families and lives
They are in a latent danger
Each second of life to be the last
Power of fire
You burn our lives
Power of fire
You fight with the steel
Power
Power
Power
Of fire
The world day by day is worse
The power gives them the advantage
They satisfy the thirst of wickedness
They satisfy the thirst of impunity
They are damned murderers and lying
All the corruption they should hide
The damned impunity will always exist
And the politics is overshadowed
Thirst  eternal thirst  eternal thirst
Thirst  eternal thirst  eternal thirst
We are them affected same old
The violence continues exploting
The bloody wars will enjoy
We continue without hope in darkness
The faith that nobody will save
The divine images will be dispelled
The fight against evil will begin
The world scandal will explode
Thirst  eternal thirst  eternal thirst
Losing life remembrances of cries 
Frozen images of last sick days 
Recalling desolation no one cried my death 
The acrid taste of rotting takes my breath away 
My violet lips covered with frost 
The paleness of those walls is lost 
It's fucking lost 
The winter grows cold 
It takes me into the frame of dust and old 
The silence in me 
Please Death set me free 
Fallin' upon my buried coffin 
the snow freezes my last smile 
And the tears are crystallized 
But the pain remains in me 
Still and cold and dead 
My body lies under the ground 
A withered flower falls on me 
Upon the ice of my grave 
ENTOMBED BY WINTER 
Memories of life times lost in my mind 
Ages of a forgotten existence so far now 
Dusty shells of pictures buried by years 
Tell me who i am 
Tell me how to see my dawn 
Tomorrow 
Were we born to struggle and suffer  
Happiness is a short while 
Where we forget to be humans 
Hate is only a waste of time 
The cold is growing end of days 
Hold my body and take me far away 
Far away from this grave of  frost 
We must enjoy these moments of inhumanity 
Before they take our dream away 
ENTOMBED BY WINTER
Last night I walked again that soil 
places in my mind 
Remembrances as cold pieces of glass 
Blood red stained mirrors 
lie broken upon the floor 
A time so far  Something we can't recall 
I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
I can't describe the day 
when we crossed our solitude ways 
Deserted houses  Haven of mine 
Tombs under eternal fog and frost 
The pool of blood is turning cold 
as we watch our reflection 
becoming red as December dusk 
I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
You'll never cry alone in the rain 
The sleep will heal our solitude days 
They'll never live the meaning of parting 
Souls left alone in the night 
as tears flow with the pain 
Loneliness coldness and bloodlust 
Alcohol razorblades and the same old places 
Blood tears and semen 
the only human things will be left of me 
I love the night as I love your eyes 
You'll burn inside the cold lands of my heart 
Our way together towards inhumanity 
Our dreams without any God above 
I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
We'll never cry alone in the rain 
Only Death now could divide our solitude ways
Darkness enshrouded from within 
Bitter rest in overwhelming solitude 
Sleeping aeons and mountains 
To conceal the tearing grief 
A human life is not worth more 
Than a tear stolen in a frozen dawn 
Than a drop of blood on a yellowed paper 
Than a shiver in the sharpened rain 
No way out of this terror 
Distance like an empty winter night 
Pieces of me randomly scattered on the floor 
Shrieks of dying animals inside my soul 
Trapped among the mortal ones 
My mourning is in vain 
Unveiled dreams have turned to nothing 
Fed on the wrecks of unanswered questions 
A human life is not worth more 
Than a tear stolen in a frozen dawn 
Than a drop of blood on a yellowed paper 
Than a shiver in the sharpened rain 
No way out of this terror 
Distance like an empty winter night 
Pieces of me randomly scattered on the floor 
Shrieks of dying animals inside my soul 
Silence is trembling screaming its rage 
Screaming 
NO WAY OUT
Lying in a dark corner 
The black candle light is dying out 
Trying to refuse this suffering 
As coldness burns my pale naked flesh 
I faced my fears a thousand times 
Endless doubts  Life of paranoia 
I try to find a way out 
From this state of suicidal urge 
I watch with empty eyes the blade 
As tears begin to fall down my face 
Another night alone with myself 
At one with melancholy and depression 
I bleed because the dark is near 
I cry as i realize you can' t be here 
I need to caress your skin in the night 
But now my only friend remains this knife 
Why must i live with these fears 
I know my only tragedy is my mind 
Sometimes i think i'm wasting all the joys 
And with this bitter thought i fear to die 
I feel so jaded now so far away 
I can't face next morning with this pain 
Another cut lacerates my flesh 
Sometimes i think it will be the last 
I'm only trying to objectivate this hate 
I prove towards myself and life itself 
I only need to watch these fifty wounds 
I opened upon my body in the night 
I only need to stop these sick death thoughts 
And cry for joy when you'll be here again 
I'll watch you sleeping naked at my side 
I'll kiss you and this blood will stop to flow 
Everyone can kill himself one day 
Life brings pain and suffering on our way 
Cut your wrists it's simpler than it seems 
But in death you'll know

The soft murmurs poured forgiving

And cut the seams that held together my breath
Lifeless I lie thoughts tear my mind and you fly
Slip the warm knife through my searing flesh
Nefarious agony slips inside my smile
this silent room
still all was weak
to echo through your soft murmurous heart 
and pierce your every word
To leave not a trace of those moments
that filled the empty halls and cold 
The word that crawled around inside falls away
that the vapours of passion drop to your feet
From this angle it almost looked human
But the hole in the ocean just swallowed me up
Down here you may hear a sharpened scream
forming featureless enfettered states
that have me tearing the walls of danger

From the window the sky empties to nothing 
plunged into a diminishing perspective
from the dead branches
but before they cold leave
they spent a cold summers eve
tending the knotted despair
of a ravaged corpseMalcom King
Scots follow you
Into battle
We will go
Conquer Lothian
To the river Forth
Overcome the Angels
Win the war
Defeated Ecgfrith
at Nectan's Mere
Subdued the picts
we feel no fear
Forge a kingdom
Take you down
Cut to pieces
In blood you'll drown
Fires in the sky we saw for 30 days they shone
Unitedunited we stand
Unitedunited forever and ever
Into battle
Kill and fight
Forge a kingdom
Scotland unite
Malcom King
You won the right
Take the throne
Scotland united
It's the year 1018
march for your country
to the battle of Carham
We will spell history
Get your steel brothers
We must fight
Hakon tries to steal
Scotish right
Norwegian soldiers on our land
Steal our Islands
We must defend
Their number's too great we can't win
God in heaven
Send a sign
Kneel and pray  the sun turns black
God with us  we must attack
In the dark of the sun
Alex king you did
win the day
You bet Hakon and
Proud Norway
We swept them off the battlefield
In their blood they lie
Death is dealed
Their king died on foreign land
United we were strong
we did stand
In the dark of the sun
The enemy's defeated run
In the dark of the sun
The battle has been won
I don't wanna be a hero
But I'll stand and never kneel
Freedom is well wort a dying
Come we'll fight with heart and steel
Beat the English at Sterling brigde
I will guard the Scotish throne
I myself skinned Cressingham
In his own blood he did drown
Fight  Freedom we fight
Stand  Scotland's pride
I am just a simple man
I'm afraid to meet my end
Braveheart they call me
If they knew if they could see
Edward's out to seek revenge
His army's great his soldiers strong
Come with me to fight at Falkirk
Send them back where they belong
I don't have the blood of kings
But I'd die for Scotland's pride
Even nobles follow me
Into battle side by side
Fight  Freedom we fight
Stand  Scotland's pride
Nightmares haunt my lonley nights
I must be strong and I must fight
Braveheart they call me
If they knew if they could see
I am just a simple man
I'm afraid to meet my end
Braveheart they call me
If they knew if they could see
Vengeance burns a raging anger
I have lost the fear to die
Braveheart that's what I am
I kill until my blood runs dry
The lust for battle in my veins
inspires me to take your life
Braveheart that's what I am
I kill until my blood runs dry
The lust for battle in my veins
inspires me to take your life
Braveheart that's what I am
I kill until my blood runs dry
I kill until my blood runs
I kill until my blood runs dry
He came in the dark night
Few men at his side
Black Douglas' arm for the Bruce
They could not loose
Stab Red Conym down
He won't wear a crown
Fight and kill we will
Win the Battle of Louden Hill
The heart of a lion
The blood of kings
A sword like thunder
Death he will bring
I am The Bruce  The King The Lion
I am The Bruce  The Master of war
March against me  pay in blood
I rule forevermore
The Bruce was crowned at Scone
His glory shone
Still the English are marching
We'll meet them at Sterling
One 'gainst three we stand
Fight for your land
The Battle of Bannockburn
A lesson they did learn
Goodbye my love I leave my fate to the king
I must be off to battle fortune it may bring
Fortune for the nobles
Death and Pain life will be sold
Goodbye my love I must fight and I may die
The king is calling I must obey
why do we have to kill
The Reaper laughs I hear him still
Screams above the battlefield
Steel and Blood a fate is sealed
The harvester of Death is out
Can't you hear him scream aloud
Into the battle into the battle
Can't you hear the screams from Flodden hill
September the 3rd of fifteen thirteen
We met the English at Flodden Hill
God knows we gave it all
A damned day I saw many fall
I stood with my king and he fought like hell
Pierced with arrows he finally fell
With the king fell Scotland's Pride
A damned day so many died
My fingers touch the solid stones
Strong and cold they keep me from home
Imprisoned like a wingless dove
Far away from the land I love
Lonely days count lonely years
I have cried a thousand tears
All that I tried to gain
Is lost the effort was in vane
At Carberry hill I lost my crown
My husband fled my luck went down
In England's hands I fell
18 years a living hell
The Scottish crown belongs to me
Yet I'm bound I can not flee
With iron claws England holds tight
All is lost no chance to fight
Silence  Silence Everywhere
Cold walls are my reward
Loneliness engulfs my soul
I've been true i gave my heart
Stained tears i cried
I long to be free again
To walk in peace again
Scotland cries her queen is lost
Agony's her friend again
Tonight I had a weird dream
I saw a demon eating men
he crushed Skulls to dust
His eyes filled with a black lust
The demon rules the battlefield
Religion rules with pain and steel
God is love
Hell is open
Searching for the truth
Searching for eternal life
Searching for the truth
You reach heaven but you're
Headed for hell
I've seen brother fighting brother
I've seen friends kill each other
Love is preached to manking
Just believe death you'll find
My king won another crown  for Scotland's pride
That is what we thought but we were not right
Now he rules in London  a faceless king
Sold his ancient kingdom to the enemy
Five laws
You gave at Perth
Betray the rights
We gained by birth
Cry cry cry cry for freedom
The heritage of centuries  you did betray
The blood of Bruce flowing in your veins
Freedom may be lost now and forever more
You gain a crown
We pay the price
You think you rule
But we will rise
By God's Grace
I'm the ing
James the 7th
Obey or death I bring
I hunt the Convenanters down
The Wigtownshire martyrs drown
Sixteen eighty five
The Black Year
Killing time
Believe in me or you must die
Killing time
Hang the victims hang them high
James Stewart reigns
Blood on his hands
His people tortured
By his own commands
Revolution sweet revenge
Hunt the tyrant off the throne
Sixteen eighty eight
The fall of The House of Stewart
Killing time
Kill the tyrant he must die
Killing time
Hang the victims hang them high
Rumours know that rebellion will break out
crown no doubt
Armed and ready stand
My rights I must defend
Steel is in my hand
The clan's are marching `gainst the law
Bagpipers play the tunes of war
Death or glory i will find
Rebellion on my mind
The town of Edinburgh fell soon in our hands
Defeated the English at the Battle of Prestopans
I walk alone through burning towns
My sword is in my hand
But the battle has been lost
And there is nothing to defend
At Culloden in seventeen forty six
Scotland's fate was sealed
We wrote a bloody history
Wounds that never healed
Fight for death or glory
Fight at Culloden Muir
Die in pain and anger
Die in pain and anger
I still see Gillis MacBean
Standing wounded from the fight
Back to the wall he fought
And thirteen Redcoats died
But the Clans were beaten and destroyed
Their wives are raped in shame
Prince Bonnie's on the fight again
The rising was in vane
We were a people free and brave
Heroes stood tall
But history is merciless
Now we are to doomed to fall
The battle of Culloden
The end of Scotland
As we raise our swords to the sky
We destroy we defy
Fight to die
As we rise our swords to the sky
Vengeance is our life live to die
Endless battles we give our blood
We sacred warriors we fight for our lands
but we want more
We want to conquer the world
We fight but we're not immortal
Only warfare is immortal
Only warfare is immortal
We're looking for power and might
We want to rule
Our duty is to kill and destroy
Steal treasures rape women
Our only god is Satan
We live to kill we fight to die
We live to fight we fight to die
The black unicorn is our emblem
When you see it on top of the muntain
This is the sign of victory
Then we return but our enemies can't wait
We have to go back to warfare
Into hell's well
Beyond the edge of the black forest
Where trees burn where birds and wolves
Servants of Lucifer sing satanic incantations
Here's the gate to hell's well
Here's the beginning of your pain
If you fall into hell's well
thousands of fallen angels servants of Lucifer
will drink your blood eat your flesh and offer
your soul to their master the bringer of light
This is your slow going to Hell
Into Hell's well Lucifer will damn your soul
Now you're haunting Hell's well
You are a fallen angel
If you fall into Hell's well
The seventh cross will be your emblem
Blood will be your wine
And Lucifer your master
Dark shadows over the graves
Deep silence only whispers
The Angel of Death is calling my name
Strange feelings I'm gonna die
Midnight in the graveyard
The Black Lady Queen of Hell
Wants me as her bloody lover
She's drawing me into the grave
I can't resist
Dead leaves over the path
I'm frozen I must die in the name of Hell
Midnight in the graveyard
The Black Lady is rising from death
She's taking my soul
Black candles around my grave
Light up the shadow of the lady like a ghost
Queen of carnal pleasure
She takes me into the grave
I'm her eternal lover
Midnight in the graveyard
Oh my lady let me die
I've crossed a pact with Satan
When funeral pyres ablaze the black moon sky
Seven newborn children I've to kill
Seven chalices with blood I have to fill
