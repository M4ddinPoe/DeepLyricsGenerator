Look at all of us running
Always behind always late
We're always playing catch up
In this human race
All of these young men dying of old age
To feel alive could cost you everything
It's hard to hold onto your ideals
When you've lost your when you've lost your innocence
When the dreams you've caught
Aren't the dreams you've chased
Now your hearts are bleeding
To keep this pace
The kid you were
Hates the man you became
You can't remember what you wanted
You just can't
Feel the same
Remember what you wanted
Remember what you chased
All of these young men dying of old age
To feel alive could cost you everything
It's hard to hold onto your ideals
When you've lost your when you've lost your innocence
When the dreams you've caught
Aren't the dreams you've chased
Now your hearts are bleeding
To keep this pace
The kid you were
Hates the man you became
You can't remember what you wanted
You just can't
Feel the same
Look at all of us running
Always behind always late
We're always playing catch up
In this human race
Remember what you chased
Music city never shines so bright
As the nights when coming home to those lights
All the cities buildings and bridges in this country
Can't compare to the love affair between you and me
I have traveled the whole world wide
And I can't find a better place to reside
Every single tour takes me kicking and screaming
Thirty hours from home my Nashville heart's still beating
this Nashville heart's still beating
Take me back home to all the kids in Rtown
Who know me for me
My heart's back in music city
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Alert the skies as hell retreats
I'm saying goodbye to my apathy
To all the workers in this town
Losing their minds in this great modern hell
The ghosts have their guns and they will destroy
Buried under broken glass lays their promised threat
From Hollywood to Vancouver Fridays mean hysteria
As wolverines break out
But tell Sophia and Alcina
We're still kicking it
Take me back home
Take me back home
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Music city
Is where my heart beats
With the heart of a child my tainted eyes have
Not lost every ounce of innocence
I still fight to hold onto my youth
I won't give into death like you
Kingdom of youthfulminded
Positive but not innocent
We still fight to hold onto our youth
We won't give into death like you
We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing
They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything
With the heart of a child
We will live forever
Children live forever
We won't be misled
We won't be misled
We won't be misled by broken dreams of wealth
We won't be misled
We will live forever
Children live forever
We will live forever
Children live forever
We are not a product of society
We are not a sick dying breed
For the meek will inherit the earth
As the weak watches its riches burn
We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing
They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything
Hallelujah
Children live forever
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
Dreams are the soul's misfortune
Meaningless and insecure
This heart could try and heal itself
But I've gone and lost the cure
In the winter of 2010 I lost my mother to the barrel of her loaded gun
Two weeks later my forgotten dad lost the battle of his lifelong suicidal run
He was dead to me years ago
But losing her was an eternal blow
I've spoke in the past of the broken
But now I really know
If there's one thing I've learned we're all put here to die
So why jump your turn
I'm living day by day
There's strange comfort in apathy
I'm living day by day
There's strange comfort in apathy
Lay cold and alone in the ground
Will it be paradise or will you burn
This is all a gamble
Until it's your turn
He was dead to me years ago
But losing her was an eternal blow
I've spoke in the past of the broken
But now I really know
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Son to none
No home but the roads I roam
Son to none
No home but the roads I roam
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
We're all brokenhearted
These wheels are turning in my head to slowly go
Where I'd rather be instead laying low
Skin and bones we know
Made of stone move slow
Move slow
These are the days
Fear takes its hold around my throat
Lost is the chase
Giving in to distance left to go to make it home
This heart is bleeding in my chest from letting go
I just can't stop from needing Hope in a better place instead
Somewhere to grow I wish we could start leaving
Hands and feet won't move
All these things we'll lose
We'll lose
These are the days
Fear takes its hold around my throat
Lost is the chase
Giving in to distance left to go we can go home
There's a battle for my soul between God the devil and rock 'n' roll
And when my head hits the sheets my feet will hit the ground running to heaven
Before the devil knows I'm dead
This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb
This place is a deadly room culturing disease waiting to burn
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb
DDDDDoctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head I need the medicine I need the medicine
DDDDDoctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head I need the medicine I need the medicine
Who will win the battle for my soul between God the devil and rock 'n' roll
And when my head hits the sheets my feet are tired of running and running and running
This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb
This place is a deadly room culturing disease waiting to burn
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb
DDDDDoctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head I need the medicine I need the medicine
DDDDDoctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head I need the medicine I need the medicine
Murdered or the murderers we're all the same
Kingsmen or the poorly dressed we're pawns in this game
Murdered or the murderers we're all the same
Kingsmen or the poorly dressed we're pawns in this game
DDDDDoctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head I need the medicine I need the medicine
DDDDDoctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
There's voices inside my head I need the medicine I need the medicine
Hell walks the earth his name is pain
I swear to God I've seen him
He's no stranger to me I know him well
I'll write your name into the stars
We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
Salvation for these many scars
We all have dreams at night we're scared to speak of
They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
Can you hear me
Can you tell me what this all means
And why God am I here
We are all the same we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places
If all roads lead home then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by day
Am I in hell Am I in hell
You've taken this a step too far
We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
We need you staying where you are
We all have dreams at night we're scared to speak of
They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
Can you hear me
Can you tell me what this all means
And why God am I here
We are all the same we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places
If all roads lead home then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by day
Am I in hell Am I in hell
We all fight for peace of mind
We all fight for peace of mind
We all have hell at our backs
Haunting our dreams
In the beds in which we weep
We all have hell at our backs
Haunting our dreams
In the beds in which we weep
My cynicism was never yours to boast
You've greatly missed the point of what was said
Instead of questioning them you just followed me
Robots zombies cattle herded by others' words
It was never meant to be like this
Breeding your anger was not my intention
Though that be the case I've made this bed
And now we all have to weep in it
Hate dissension between brothers of the same
Words meant to provoke thought misread instead
Was I even right in my accusations
My words are a weak foundation for your war
Hate dissension war
Did I start this
Hate dissension war
I can't stop this
I can't stop this
It was never meant to be like this
Breeding your anger was not my intention
Though that be the case I've made this bed
And now we all have to weep in it
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
Speak of regretting and all the risk we take
Speak to the morning and when our eyes awake
The patterns are completing the men they say we are
But as the sun is setting I'll answer in the dark
When the world sings of all its trouble
And I hear all about its pain
I'll listen in for its groans are not in vain
It's hard to remember how these dreams were made
When all the reasons and all the rules have changed
There's healing in His voice and freedom in The Name
But these misunderstandings we give up all the same
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
With no place to call home
Run away
From everything you've ever known
Run away
With no place to call home
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
I have no place to call my home
Gain a friend then I lose a friend
It doesn't matter 'cause tomorrow it will happen again
I'm losing touch with everyone at home
It's really hard when you're born born to roam
Oh how I hate the line Outta sight outta mind
I'm on the search for the greenest grass that I will never find
Oh how I hate the line Outta sight outta mind
I'm on the search for the greenest grass that I will never find
I've run and run
I've drove and drove
Three hundred thousand miles of lonely roads
To see the ones I love at home
Move on and on without me I'm just a memory
Is this the life I chose
Have I chosen poorly
Or has it chosen me
Will it let me go now
With action comes reaction
We're all a slave to something
Dreams aren't meant to be lonely
Will you answer me
Is this heaven or hell
Is this living the dream
Or is this a living nightmare
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
With no place to call home
The world is on fire
And I've done nothing but watch it burn
The world is on fire
And soon it will take the last of us
I've heard it said before that boys play games and men live the truth
I've had it all wrong this whole time because I thought it was all braun and brute
All these tattoos and all these miles haven't made me a man just yet
I'm nothing more than a frightened kid demanding undeserved respect
The world is on fire
The world is on fire
I've been thinking a lot these days
What if hell's not all fire and devils
All the stuff they taught us as children just to keep us scared and wondering at night
What if we make our own hell every time we cause pain
Every time we cause suffering there's hell on earth to pay
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
I've seen my share of heartache but I'm not the only one
My hopes and dreams are setting
They're setting with the sun
The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast down from the Heavens yet never Fallen
He  whom gods hath scorned
Eden's imbecile perimeter ruptured
I am of the Shining One
Whip merciless their flesh
Goad with firebrands
Trumpet the advent of the bloodspray
Enraptured by torment and flames
Broken on the rack crush the cult of Nazarene
My cup runneth over
Each Nazarene I kill
Is one thorn more
In the crown of their false saviour
A king foresworn in a halo of flies
Prostrate disciples of derisive subjection
Their spirits exude deification of defeat
A talisman profane  vile birthright borne
Enslaving vigour as if nailed to a cross
Scoff at this inheritance of wretchedness
The Daimons erect shatter shackles of deceit
Sons of Vengeance consecrate burning ways
Wolves no longer in the guise of the weak
Gammadion upon our shields
The Conquerors draw nigh
Pentagrammaton  ashes to dust
Unbridled conflagrations purify
Christhammer
Swoon  poison souls procured
Acknowledge the rot of divinity
The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast aside despair in chaos consecrate
For visions become truth in wakefullness
The seeming sorrows that mark my face
With head held high are tears of joy
I am the spear in the wound of christ
Corvus corax descending
Through ashes smoke and pain
Stark sepia sigil of strength
The revealing stench of victory
Lycanthropic ripping death
A baptism in annihilation
Drips from the jaws and howls
An ultimate oblivion conceived
Wartorn
A solution for flesh and bone
The morbid throne the strong revere
With genocide
Our might makes right
Where charnal houses
Leer at the world
Where crown and cudgel
Ferocity
Rains from the skies
Withered rotted bodies unburied
Lay piled in stacks instead
Vermin swarm and vultures gather
To feast upon the dead
Anthemic holocaust and hate
Stern lord of war and vengeance
Rough beast slouching eternal
Resolves the world to dust again
Wartorn
Beasts of prey strike with lightning speed
Wagons of war collide
Metallic plague armored locusts drive
Into the storm of steel
Exterminate  feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar
Motorized slaughter panzers smash
Reliquary immemorial of runic conquest
Wincing crablike across a scarred land
Into the storm of steel
Bombs flagellate as poisoned rain
Corrosives soaking deep
The skin of earth erupts in sores
Wounds and filth unending
Winged death  spurting flames vilify
Splatter the Whore of Armageddon
Gutteral ejaculate  mummifying rust
Disintegrating bones to dust
Exterminate  feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar
Petals ripen glisten with yearning
Sanctified vessel inflamed
Fervent fingers twitch the gulf is closed
Envelop the pillar of alabaster
Cockroach entrenches in some awful orifice
Excavating living tissue
Barbaric caress  greased up and slick
pain scraping a backwards bending
Clamps smear open a warm paradise
Ribcage and vertebral column contracted tight
Bars stretched beneath the skin
Lips pulled back and drawn for curing
Penetrate  probing swollen infestation
Fisted into comprehension
Rigid so to bend contorted and suffer
Straight jacket of sadism
Phallelujah
Sanguinary rite of passage
Sweet tongues of fire
Phallelujah
Paroxims of union
Phallelujah
Judas tongue scrapes spit
Bites the hand that feed it
Infectious features baring cracked teeth
Bleeding gums of joy
Phallelujah
Flaying souls breach the vestal wall
Chorus of angels consortium of pain
Enriched blood of freshly esoterica
Mingles with man in fluid form
Outpouring thrust pelvic abominations
Thick film of sweat grim lubrication
Soon to suckle maggots at her breasts
Celebrate the palsied throes of innocence
Phallelujah
In the dancing blaze of world cremation
Ashes usurp the thrones of untruth
In the glowing funeral pyres
Where shadows and smoke no longer betray
Furnace fired  matter laid bare
The true nature of existence
Reap the whirlwind
Mercifully engulf the current universe
Reap
Reap the whirlwind
Unfetter a seedling chaos to spawn
Strip away the artificial mantle
The veneer that pompously claims
That this world is worthy of salvation
Self satisfaction  armageddon
For that is all we can ask for
Every leader a fool with a facade
Every holy man a sinner
Every love a selfish lust
Every war an orgy of laughter
Every living creature a cancer
A defilement  this flesh corrupts
Reap
All truth is fabrication
Almighty hallowed nothingness
All paths spiral downwards
All answers winged lies
All questions should be phrased with axes
Indulge celebrations enshrined in blood
Astride the inexorable
Jericho's wall shall crumble divine
Grasp the horns of the Dragons of Chaos
Furious we ride
Lascivious  that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
The tenderness of little girls is not unknwown to me
Ripping sacred vestments  venereal debauch
Frozen phalanx thrusts
Dampened walls summmon hallucinations
Erupting wicked cold that burns like fire
Daughters of joy await the vulgar visitation
Depravity nocturnal  emissive lusts they crave
Inject impurity filth and fornication
A winged satyr raping unsullied maids
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm of the despicable unborn
Urinary baptism and licked clean
Eat until it poisons me
Enslaved to those fleshly folds
Erected into bleakness
Unchaste phantasmagoria
The salacious sordid pulse prevails
Corrupting every orifice
Greedy for love
This flesh corrupt
On bestial bloodstained wings
Rites of disgust
The incubus obscene
Lascivious  that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
The tenderness of little girls is not unknwown to me
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm of the despicable reborn
What is to be of this pestilience
That makes empires tumble like tears
The dust of millenia  fallen ages
Staunches the flow of dawning horizons
Obscuring 
While the days crumble as their hours unfold
A sensual swooning  prophetic mocking
As the soils swallow the seeds of the past
Each one of us to his own
Embrace
Drowning in hallowed solitude
Swallowing the void
The pallid hope revealed at last
Embrace
*Why should I fret in microcosmic bonds
That chafe the spirit and the mind repress
When through the clouds gleam beckoning beyonds
Whose shining vistas mock man's littleness*
Throw off those shackles of sufferance
This penance of one thousand ordeals
I wield the scepter of destiny
Choose the means of my own death
Give me both nails and a hammer
Harness those ecstasies of death
Prostrate myself on cruciform
At last
With swift feet I made my way
Helmed by a cacophony of despair
Deaf to the legacy of youthfullness
And beauty and joy since pined away
Yet now a rush falls upon my ears
Of dripping  whispering words
The hole of emptiness I pour through
Unveils the caress from far beyond
Now no longer can I ignore
What goes before has gone again
The silence of immorality
Satisfied with this one fell step
Plunge beneath the waters 
The freezing embrace of the goddess of death
Awake Sons of Vengeance rise
Rub the dust of twenty centuries from your eyes
Fashion your being ploughshares into weapons of war
Today we conquer the self  tomorrow the world
Men of war defiant  to ashes fall the gods
Apocalyptic deeds  fierce archonic might
A knell a pall masking honored rites of spring
The empyreal majesty of abyss winds
An affirmation of struggle
Like wolves closing in for the kill
Making holy our war immortal this glorious night
A brotherhood of iron  falling in we march
Shout into the star shattered Dawn
We are Sons of Vengeance
Blessed and bold
Reborn in hate
Fingers of scorn fists of furious destruction
Discipline of steel beyond the roar of all war
Unleashed lightning storm brigades to be
Powerful creative joyous and free
There is a land in the middle east region
ruled by black gold
and a crazy religion
There is a satan with certain charisma
he instigates thousands to play the Kamikaze game
the tyrant has the power of words
His bible is built on barbaric foundations
laws from a forgotten century that live again
to die is a straight way to glory
Black widows march proclaim their own slavery
and even children grow to fighters in war
David fights Goliath Uncle Big Satan
the banner of the holy warblood for bloodlife for life
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
A hellish old man plans the overkill riot
he letz his land bleed till end in a war for his pride
it's his demonstration of might
The distinguised expression on face of the old man
his hiding ideas full of madness for adamned deadly game
We won't retain to fight it back
save the ballance land he rules
We'll hold the power on the border
they've sworn the oat
hand die on his order
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
So it's destroyed the work of a century
the iron towers melt down in the fire of hate
No survivor in a war out of gain
pain or glory described in the book of all fates
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
He is responsible

Rising from the night of time
rising from damnation
growing furtive to old size
a thousand years old nation
Finding victims for their Reich
the lands' got a lot of strangers
they call back the crystal night
to burn the war creation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Then the last man of their kind
finished life in prison
he's a martyr for their aims
started killing seasons
Now they march the insane hords
call the NeoNation
again the right hands risen high
a skinny revelation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Banned graphitti on the walls
words of hate and murder
waiting for their masters call
back in line and order
In a land where neighbours are strangers
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Seventh day restless I wait
yes I wait for the right word
twelve o'clock this is my time
time to change to the nightbird and like
a snake I am winding myself into tight jeans
the look on my face's gonna make all the
girls know what I mean
I come in the music stops
and you see everyone turning
then I walk cool as I can
straight to the bar and start smoking
I feel hot looks in my back
and I'll soon chose my victim
I am the king and my right is to show you
what I need
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
so show action and go
I think of the time that I waisted
how can you tell till you've tasted
Why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life
My straight face is lying about motions
that live in my heart
like a figure of stone
I am waiting for you to start
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
I think of the time that I waisted
how how can you tell till you've taisted
why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life
You're running into tragedy
signs announcing danger
for your life
will end in agony
and your bodies will decay to dust
Dust you are created of
and eternal laws can never change
change in our universe
dust to dust decays
You'll roast in flames
with the soals fo no name
your bones burste under mountains of bones
A voice from some
whereis calling your name
when you're in league with the gods
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
Everything that you achieved
all you tried has been in vain
you're treated with indignity
somewhere in a nowhere you will
fight
for the right to survive
don't blasphemise the holy signs
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
you will decay
Somewhere on a border
forced to march in line and order
looo men in greedy hands
Lured with hope for future
pressed in contracts
leaving them no chance
but to leave their land
They're nameless young men
bleeding their hands
on the edge of life
and they feel the hate
treated like slaves
There's a shanty village
where they are folded in dirt
dirt and a mess
intimidations breaking
the free will of men
free will of men
free will of men
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Somewhere in a office
noble looking and expensive
accepted by a corrupt state
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Locked in a cage
tied with invisible chains
on iron walls of pain
faces expressing their torture
denying their age
1000 years
reflected in mirrors of eyes
and brain
flowing rage
a rage crushing in fragments
past recorgnition their mind
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Back to back here we stand
our guns they are ready and loaded
ten steps forward and then turn
the strike of the bullets will hurt you
Eye to eye with icecold looks
that make you feel there is danger
they have might to hypnotize
and they will never release you
You search for the stronger
you search for the truth
you're searching so long
wasting your youth
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search for the truth
fight it out if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search
Search for the stronger of two
Keep cool bleed and fight your fear
Success's laying only in your hands
just try hard the end is near
your name will be sung through the lands
You search for the stronger etc 
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out
etc 
You ride on a silver spider
captured in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way to help
You walk through tubes of mistery
you see light at the end
but when you reach the exit
your're cought by thousand hands
You ride on a silver spider
captures in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way
You fall pictures create the lies
You fall but your mind denies
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
don't you lose your dreams tonight
In the night
You sail on a purple ocean
the wind inflates your wings
burned by an old emotion
your wooden sailboat sinks
When flames of memory touch you
you'll see they've burned so long
and deep in a nest in side you
another dream is born
You fall 
Hold on 
You ride on a silver spider 
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on save dreams for me
Hold on every nightmare's got an endEverynight I say a prayer
Look at me nobody cares
Just a mirror passing by
Looked inside
I've lost my pride
Stay with me not for so long
It's alright no needs no hope
Such a miracle
looking back
Times gone by
and life wasn't bad
Lord light my way
Fill these withered
careless hands
Oh skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh skies are falling down
Skied are falling down
See the birds are back
At the docks and everywhere
Here in Lisbon realized
This whole world
so strange and divine
Lord light my way
Fill these withered
careless hands
Oh skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh skies are falling down
Skied are falling down
Sat beside the meadow
Watching weeds agrow
Cleaned up all the ashes
Of my soul
Wrote down my own sentence
Now you take your way
Fades the last remembrance
Of your lovely pretty face
I after all
Just a lonely man  a lonely heart
Working on the future
Floating on fate
Faced the circunstances
Cleared up the shades so
Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting life's been wasted
 maybe I wanna die some other day
Hear the whispers of your hope
The answer wasn't told
No don't laugh seeing me cry
The end I've left behind
 the whispers of your hope are left behind
Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting life's been wasted
And I've tried
Maybe you deny
Words of peace
For the future of our lives
Bring to me
Something else than a broken heart
I won't wait 'till my life is wasted
 maybe I wanna die some other day
So time is waiting
Now overloaded
See weeping eyes
Let me alone
Angels crying
Back to the war
Angels dying
Rest in their fall
Come to me try to see
future is not what you wished it to be
'cos everyday seems the same
To the whole mankind
So why still you're standing on the field all your life
sowing the seeds that'll never grow
season won't end 'till the fine grains harvest comes
We're waiting for the dawn
The change must start right now
Oh scars are fading
seeds now may grown
feeding no more lies
raising as the sun
Angels are crying and dying
for holy chants of
fareweel to kings
overthrown by the purpose light
Nobody ships when the glimpse
of your target comes behind you
Like steps of the pilgrims unshinedEverywhere faces I see stare back in despair
Trading places with those faces
Won't go far but you must hold on
You don't know what you've got until it's gone
And without fear to disappear
You pay the price for your life
Hope as high as the mountains
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside to stay alive
And face my fears with the will to live
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go far go together and blanket the cold
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go fast go alone but never back up and fold
Everyday you have to face the fight to find a way
Nothing's easy that will please me
As I search for truth and hold on
To everything I've found in 'til I'm gone
And at the end my life is spent
I'm facing death with the path I went
Hope as high as the mountains
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside to stay alive
And face my fears with the will to live
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go far go together and blanket the cold
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go fast go alone but never back up and fold
Desolate
This is becoming
And beneath the feet of us this Earth will shake
It will take the treasures invested in your soul
As the sky turns red and the oceans boil
From the depths  of the untread given birth by a distant sun
Apophis discriminates against no one
To turn sand into glass
We'll be done by midnight
When the sky is turned to stone
And its earth against earth
The death of the sapian
The wise and the faithful
Only the man with the reason
Will this notice be useful
Destroyer of worlds
You can black out the sky
Our reasons to live and lie are our reasons to die
Obscene is the waste of this earth
A celestial body for that it is cursed
More then this plague of man
We yearn for wings and lungs with air
As our reign on earth comes to an end
Suicide in mind for a death before our time
The corruption flow is our fatal crime
So hold your breath until your lungs are wet
But hold your loved ones closer in the darkness hold composure
We're failing but we're alive
To find your piece of mind
Search in this great divide
Walking blindly looking through the eyes of scripture
They pick the teachings only fit for today
Manmade gods moulded in our only image
Blind faith and myths compose all our history
What's the voice inside My mind is filtered with the moral Zeitgeist
There was no sin
But the absence of truth in the world
I won't take part in the foolishness held
We die for freedom
Only the wise survive
We die for truth
Paying the price with lives
We abandon this logic at expense to ourselves
We abandon this logic at our expense
Let's watch the suns burn into darkness
They don't all have to be from Earth
Be all from Earth
In the white sky view of the future
When time has told if we are worthy or not
Let's watch the suns burn
In the end when committed to darkness
We shall learn death from truthmy mind turns into my heart
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run run run
playing out my very last chance to run
taking me down off this cross
lay me down in the dust
where my eyes cant't see
no more sober words of love
this is my last chance to run
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
to live to be alive
just run run run
take a look in the mirror
my mind turns into my heart
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run run run
playing out my very last chance to run
my last chance to run my last chance
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
the mirror tells me
all I need to know
so I forget it after all
it's all for you
but somehow I my not stop
so I stopped smiling
so I stopped breathing
in all that you did
in all what you are
here I stand
where my past is as far as the sun
in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything
in my head I say your name slowly
for this point in time
I will stop my heart and I'll wait for I'll wait for you
my life is going to cave in
in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything
when you move your hand over my back
this could be the very last time
the very last moment
one moment from somewhere else
only for you
the bright lights shine
but the truth is I am lost for words
and I will stop my heart stop my heart and I'll wait for I'll wait for you
my life is going to cave in
at the heart of the matter
just take a closer look
make it easy cause it is
it's all black and white when the music stops
it ends so it begins
sometimes I think I understand
everyday I know that
I may be closer to
to something beautiful
you are tomorrow in today
and you will ever be
the you I know is fading away
no guts no glory
the you I know is fading away
just stand up and be counted
can't say goodbye to somebody you don't know
so it begins so it ends
I think I  understand
sometimes I think I understand
allow me to join your presence
no need to argue even for one second
oh what a beautiful view
the beauty in your eyes
the warmth of your smile
a heart of perfection
I would fight the darkest roads
to protect your shining eyes
these are my unarmed words
but I'm not the one
you're looking at
still I did
but doesn't arise
please don't worry about me
I'm already lost I'm already gone
but you don't love me and I do too
I wish I could
I thought you would
this oppressed soul of mine
got no tears for long time
this is getting wrong
just bear it up and say the truth
as early as your eyes do
this moment will race forever
all my life I was running away
but the sad part is I'm still here
where did I go wrong all along
now I can leave my things behind
cause it's all going off without me
now the time has come
to clear the air and hit the road
damn what we wait for
I've got no time to lose
driving in my old car
mind out
maybe our backlight has gone
for sure we're already drove too far
just leave my grave undone
listen to the voice in the radio
the tragedy starts from the very first spark
all good things come from above
I'm tired from being put off
I didn't really know how to call it
a name to conjure with
you're a little bit more then I thought you'd be
and now you're drowning me
and get lost in the sea
lost in an oceanI grew up in the cold with frost inside my bones But this chill runs through me like the cold never knew me
This reaper on my back keeps whispering an easy way out but I ain't scared of it
I'm not scared to live and I ain't scared of it I'm not scared to live
Explanation 
This is about growing up with pain and struggle
These trials and tribulations will scar you forever
Everyone has their own story
Most of my scars are not physical but mental
Although at times I feel weakened by the path I took to become the man I am today
I wouldn't be who I am without those lessons
The war is constant I have overcome  I will always overcome
You dig a hole 5 days a week
So you can sleep at night So you can sleep
Carry the burden carry the weight
It will drown you one day
And then you'll sleep forever
And your body will rot
The years will bury your name and over time you'll be forgotten
Carry the burden carry the weight
It will drown you one day
Oh it's hard to see a good hearted kid running scared
Running scared with a tail between their legs going back
Going back on every single thing that they ever said
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
Than be afraid to live
Than to be a coward going back on every single thing that they ever said
I'd rather be dead
You dig a hole
5 days a week
so you can sleep at night So you can sleep
Carry the burden carry the weight
It will drown you one day
Oh it's hard to see a good hearted kid running scared
Running scared with a tail between their legs going back
Going back on every single thing that they ever said
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
You won't get to quench the greed
You won't get to justify the want with the need
You won't get to live beyond your means
Six feet deep
Your body will rot
Coffin keeper
No one will remember your name
Explanation
Life is so short If working an office job or the counter at some fast food place makes you happy then you're doing it right You shouldn't have to count down the hours waiting to die behind a desk or a power tool if you don't want to be there Find something you love be the best you can be at it and most of all be happy
I saw your ghost it was calling out for me Do you know where it goes at night because it always come to me
I saw your ghost it was calling out for me Do you know where it goes at night
Because it always comes to me
The world turns and I'll forever mourn
And I'm sorry that I wasn't the closest
And I'm sorry but I always cared
I could see this coming a mile away
Didn't do enough to show you another way
I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam
And I can't sleep some nights when I see your face
Just to know a life can be lost and just slip away
You were fucked up when I saw you and I don't know if you ever knew
You were fucked up when I saw you but my words to you forever ring true
I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam
Sometimes those feelings affect me Like I never could grasp the reality of when you left me and that's selfish to say because you left us all when you took your life away
Haunt me as I roam
You needed something to something to hold on to
I guess theres too much of you in my veins  it's slowly starting to shut me down
Give me a reason to breath
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave
Tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
 it's slowly starting to shut me down
Ive been thinking I've been thinking about this too long and I've been going about this all too wrong
Never knew what to say or what to do to voice these thoughts the best to you
When I wake up I feel sick
There is no end to this There is no end
I guess theres too much of you in my veins  it's slowly starting to shut me down
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
Nothing worth keeping comes that easy
This pain this world won't defeat me
Never knew what to say or what to do
To voice these thoughts the best to you
When I wake up I feel sick
There is no end to this
I guess theres too much of you in my veins  it's slowly starting to shut me down
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
When I Wake I feel sick
There Is No End to this
I'm staring at the sun screaming out my lungs I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind I've got so much trouble on my mind I can't describe
No words to hide the pain behind my eyes
So where do we go from here
give me heaven give me hell give me an answer
ARE WE LOST WANDERLUST
Still searching all these years gone by and still no end in sight
I'm still staring at the sun
screaming out my lungs
Ive sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
I'm staring at the sun screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
When did the compass break
when did we lose our way
give me heaven give me hell give me an answer
ARE WE LOST WANDERLUST
Still searching all these years gone by and still no end in sight
I'm still staring at the sun screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
I'm staring at the sun screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
I swear with myself as my witness
that I I'll get through anything
I can get through this
I swear with myself as my witness
that I'm still staring at the sun screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
Explanation  I discovered hardcore hip hop and punk music when I was about 12 years old courtesy of older siblings At the time of writing this I am 29 years old That's almost 20 years later I'm still coming back to this music to escape To help me heal To hype me up To put me to sleep To wake me up To connect To disconnect To reminisce and to daydream of what could be
So So sick of the same thing Someone wake me up get me out of this dream
So So sick of a life on repeat Broken Record still spinning the same beat
Still dying still lying through your teeth
I still see disease in your eyes in these streets ever hour every day every week
Look at me I still remember everything
And I hope you walk the earth alone
And I hope you carry the weight of every lie you spun of every straw you placed that broke a back
I hope your dog blood rots you from the inside out
Get those middles fingers up cause
Fuck the government fuck the cops
Fuck authority and fuck the system
And fuck you too if you're fucking with them
Now whose side are you on If you're not on mine You're just a nark just a snitch just a bitch don't pretend we are one and the same And I'm so sick of the same shit
On repeat like it's Groundhog Day
There's always hell to pay and we are all just die in the end
Life's short Down for anything
FUCK A FAKE FRIEND
I still see disease in your eyes in these streets ever hour every day every week
I still remember everything
And I hope you walk the earth alone and I hope you carry the weight
Of every lie you spun of every straw you placed that broke a back
I hope your dog blood rots you from the inside out
Get those middles fingers up cause
Fuck the government fuck the cops
Fuck authority and fuck the system
And fuck you too if you're fucking with them
Now whose side are you on If your not on mine You're just a nark just a snitch just a bitch dont pretend we are one and the same
So now the lines been drawn in the sand
You better fucking know on which side that you stand
and if there's a single doubt in your weak fucking mind
bet that we all know that you ain't one of our kind
the life we live ain't for the faint heart you see
so do your research before you try and walk this line g
this is for real we ain't playing no games
you fucking lame we ain't one and the same bitch
I'm a dreamer I've always been Some would say the things I believe aren't realistic or obtainable I've always wished for a just future where those in power strive to preserve the environment sustain all forms of life and most importantly care for the people People over profit should be an unquestionable trait in every politician But sadly we live in a world corrupted by money and status We destroy beautiful things to create and consume products that are both toxic to ourselves and to the places we live I would liken these practices of the human race to a disease a cancer eating away at the world until we eventually kill it At the time of writing this song there have been countless acts of police violence against unarmed surrendering civilians on the news These law enforcers are meant to serve and protect the public They are there to make it as safe as possible Not to shoot to kill someone who steals two cans of soda There is no outcry from other policemen condemning their peers' actions there is no scream for change with how they are educated in serving the public This song is about endeavoring to being a conscious consumer Living a just life in all regards Having fun with your friends doing what you love and not disrespecting those along your path who don't deserve it because if you can't change your own habits then how can you expect anyone else to It's also a fuck you to those that don't
I used to see the world in your eyes All its beauty and its pain
And we felt the same
Now I only see the darkness inside
Only sorrow remains
And I drown in the shame
That I feel better for it
Yet I wonder if I should discard this success and share the pain as penance
For every wrong that I've done It's wrong that you suffer For I was your lover
If you're in my heart then you're in my veins and I didn't think that'd go away
But something cut so deep and you bled out of me
And she said I hope you die I hope you rot in a loveless grave Just pain all love forgotten and she said I hope you choke
You will beg for my forgiveness you will beg for my sympathy and I'll say no I'll say nothing
Fuck it's so damn hard Fuck it
I was the blood in your veins you flowed through me one and the same but the knife cut so deep and you bled out of me
And I drown in the shame that I feel better for it
For every wrong that I've done it's wrong that you suffer For I was your lover
If you're in my heart then you're in my veins and I didn't think that would go away but something cut so deep and you bled out of me
A house that used to be a home
Now stands empty  the bodies that grew within now walk alone
And she said you will wake up one day and realise that everything you hated
was just you reflected and on that discovery self loathing and misery will drown you unequivocally
Go figure
Explanation From my experience love is the worst / best thing you can ever be lucky enough to share It never runs out but sometimes it can breed bitterness and spite People do and say horrible things when they're hurt and then those words are stuck with the other forever It's fucking hard
And forgive my sin but then I prayed for the day the rains come and wash you away All the deceit all the abuse all the disease To cleanse the wound to end the curse So I can heal be free of your disease I pray
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
and forgive my sin but then I prayed for the rains to come and wash you away
How many years have I known you
How much time have we shared
How many lies have you spilled into the air
And after all this time I've seen so many leave your side you will never realise 
you will never know why
I pray
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
and forgive my sin but then I prayed for the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
EXPLANATION  Surround yourself with like minded people to be the best you can be Don't accommodate those who drain your time and energy Their negativity will creep into you and waste you away
I can give and I can run until there is nothing left and then at my end what solace will appear What should I expect Broken and a mess Cliche words but fit my profile best
I feel sorry for those who have wrung these words so there's no colours left because you can't climb the mountain when the truth comes crashing down on you
I can live and I can love until there is nothing left and then at my end I wonder if my solace will appear
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can be beautiful in every way
We all have ugly days
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can be beautiful in every way
Do you know what it's like to be bested
Have you lost have you fought  not won
Do you know what it's like to be tested
Do you know what it's like to overcome
I can fake and I can hate until there is nothing left and then at my end what solace will appear
What should I expect Broken and a mess Cliche words that crush my fucking chest
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can beautiful in every way
We all have ugly days
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can be beautiful in every way
We all have ugly days
Explanation  Don't focus on the negatives out of your control Keep your head held high believe in yourself
Mother father what have I done Where is your quiet son what has he become
Stuck inside these walls
Stare through the windows into my soul
Just tell it where to go
It's got no hope  it's got no home
I've made some mistakes and I've burnt all of you
I've made some poor decisions and I've hurt all of you
I am I am I am  the same inside but those actions will haunt me until i die
Not afraid to say I lost my way Walked this path for too long Am I better off Am I worse No regrets just some sad fucking songs
I'm afraid I lost I am worse
No regret No cure I accept this curse
Stuck inside these walls
Stare through the windows into my soul
Just tell it where to go
It's got no hope  it's got no home
I'm afraid I lost I am worse
No regret No cure I accept this curse
Mother father what have I done
Where is your quiet son what has he become Mother Father
Explanation  We all make mistakes The only real mistake you can make is not learning and growing from what you have experienced
The sun is shining but your blood runs cold there is a chill in your bones
And you would swear there is a hole where your heart is meant to be
Not sure why but your inside is hollow and empty
And you're thinking some dark dark thoughts but you can push them right out of your mind if you try I swear
Trust me
Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long say farewell
live and let die
It is cliche but every word I truly mean
there is so much beauty to be seen
And you're beautiful too kid
You will be loved you will be warm
And these paths in life are meant to be walked
Believe me
Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long say farewell
live and let die
Just don't give up
Just don't let go
I know you won't
Just spend a little less time chasing those thoughts in your mind and just let them go
Things are gonna be different kid
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better and everything will change
It will get better and everything will change
Things are gonna be different kid and everything will changeOH
Every day
Set the goals embrace the illusion
This ain't the way supposed to be
Confessed yourself to death
And wore your scare on every sleeve
This candied maxim stays the same
This pained reprieve
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
Bury me
In this suit I wear today
Another wasted dream
A dream that fades away
Staring at these walls
Inside this fucking hourglass
Just stand in line
This lonely mile
Is bleaker still
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
It's a long road nowhere
This journeys fate intact
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
Burn
The fire will light the path
Trade for the nightfall
The pattern is so predictable
Another reason to dream in the moment
Not be denied
I'm not a product of circumstance 
Or a name in a line
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
It's this sheltered life that you're living
Try to recognise
Your choked up words
Are empty still
Fight Blood in the throne room
It's over
These towers fall
Blood in the throne room
It's over
This towers fall
Your lies
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
We're alone
Fear is the change
That brings you down
Blood in the throne room
It's over it's over
Mirror my lesson learned
Tailored for reason
Laid to rest your lies
It bleeds the weak
This shallow empire is built on lives
Lives crushed down as they tried to fight 
This darkened heart will bear no compromise
And with no thought of weakness
Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
The task is simple
Put more coins in the hand
Now hold your tongue
And lay your loyalty down
Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
Blue blooded tyrants
The faces of sin
They wear the masks
That smile with mercies grin
Black gates protecting
Their fortress of lies
It holds the vial of ink
That scripts our demise
This greed infects
Their blackened hearts are reaping
Gold and green
Amassing as we lose the fight
For now we see an altered shade of real
There's no one left to conquer
You're born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
Crusade
To march with a heart filled with rage
A lust for revenge
Traded for blood
Stare as the life drips from the blade
It seals your demise
How easy the hand fits the throat
Your mind so cold and hollow
Will disgrace and destroy
Yet still claim reprieve
So easily
Your faith blinds you all
You the restless martyr
Now receive
A solemn note from callous hands
These are the words you must obey
Take life for belief
Vile actions echo through time
Now raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
Lead the guilty to the rope
Unite and raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
Never forgive never forge
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
You trail the hounds
That chase your dreams away
Hopeless you are
The vultures lie in wait
Graceless road ahead
Your fate is undisguised
Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again
Dare to fail
The rope's around your neck
Obey the call
When it sounds like hope
Crushed by apathy
You'll forever be lost
Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope
Wake from this nightmare
Step from the ruins
That shadow fates embrace
Break from these chains
That shackle
Rise and prevail
Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again
Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope
Lay your dollar down
To pray before me
These words that i'll preach
Are set to stoke the fire
Raise your hands
This gift of hope I give to you
Your faith is my cruel device
Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
For I
The Evangelist
You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Is this the price of belief
Now praise
The souls that give will now be saved
My words are lies laced with disguise
Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
Immortal I stand
You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Be forever lost
You'll never find redemption
no matter what the cost
This is the price of belief
What sight to witness
This is darkened room shows no escape
Chaotic bleakness
These thoughts that haunt my will
To be free
A cursed fire burns inside
As I embrace the silence
The peace is fuel for the machine
As I feel
Wrath of fate
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
I'm fighting this solace
I pay my debt with anxious fear
But still I face this
Rising tide of blame
Am I the criminal
Or am I the victim
Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
Am I the liar
In that I must doubt
Is this still real
Am I the noble one
I set them free
Now set me free
Sleep soundly no more
Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
Sit the fuck down little boy
I've seen a million like you
And I wish everyone could see
Cold heart and hollow mind
This story's getting so old and dire
It's rehashed pathetic and weak
Wretched you stand
Desperate you'll fall
You'll struggle in vain
Blind hate so unjust
I'm sick of hearing from you
The lies
Your cruelty without a cause
Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed
Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same
Shameless tainted soul
Your tale will never be told
Denied archaic it's echoes are weak
Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed
Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same
Dark reveals
I sense her luring eyes
And her evil intentions
Without a voice
She calls me into her arms
But I feel a cold embrace
The sweet sting of fear
Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of existence
Take my hands
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave
Alone
I fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Towards me she steps 
In silence
Bitter her stare
Can I turn away from this
Our fatal engagement
Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of your life
As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternity
Now take my hand
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave
As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternityRites of death
Rites of undeath
We're falling
We're falling down
I told you we're into deep
Transfer life into what's dead
The act of human playing God
Redoing the acts of medieval
Witchcraft and the worship of dead
We're falling we're falling down
From our throne so supposedly high
When we confront the power great
The might of our own creator
Transfer life into what's dead
The act of human playing God
The rites of undeath
Is the testament of our own death
Enter the halls of distant memory
Feel your previous actions once again
Your lies and deceit
Your hate and long lost love
Walk through the hallway of you past
Sense the evil like a whip from beyond
The doors keep on forever
Possibility is endless
Wander through one of the bronzecovered doors
And feel the weaves of old times cruelty
Run from the darkness the endless void
And get yourself cornered by the demons of fear
Running and screaming through these ancient halls
The presence of something unseen carries on
Of old time cruelty
the past haunts you
of old times cruelty
save me
The regrets of all actions that you've done before
has now turned it's way back to you
The demons from the past haunts your soul
Walk through the hallway of your past
sense the evil like a whip from beyond
the doors keep on forever
possibility is endless
Your ideals are wicked and deceiving
how can you find peace
you seek the righteous but find the void
Die by the sword of live by the book
Glimpse your death within the scythe
seek the righteous find the truth
the book of eternal youth
Of generations
cold as stone you wander still
awaiting your inevitable death
your quest has ended where it began
But is there really a life for me
is there a place to dwell
pleasures of the flesh
vio dolorosa
Of fear and despair you've wandered
of hatred and grief you've slaughtered
I've seen you in your darkest hour
I know you as myself
But is there really a life for me
Via dolorosa memento mori
In you I've found my nothing
in you I can't hide my pain
in you my love has gone
in you I've kept my cold
Captor of sin you've stolen my past
via dolorosa
I've wasted my life for you
My hate you create
My blood is water
my life means nothing
my warmth has vanished
The grip no longer holds
When passion abandons
The bonds no longer clutch
And the rope screams you name
A path of daggers
But where to step
A hallway of illusions
Of what was
Duty heavy as a mountain
The battle draws near
Your shoulders carry many
Still death seems remarkably void
You wonder fate in lack of faith
What you consider luck may be God's will
A wanderer of the light will never die
Before God gives his approval
A path of daggers
The crown I carry as an aura above me
Is the proof of who my saviour truly is
My mute cries overheard
My blindness is seen
My tears washed away
My feebleness became my strength
Duty heavy as a mountain
The  battle draws hear
Your shoulders carry many
Still death seems remarkably void
You wonder fate in lack of faith what you consider luck may be Gods wil
A wanderer of the light will never die
Before God gives his approval
A path of daggers
When love is lost only hate will remain
I am in pain
I am the cursed one
Life is not what it was meant to be
What I didn't ask for has now turned my way
Somewhere in a garden it all turned wrong
Things I once believed in have now turned evil
Yet I pray Deliver me from evil
But another spell pulled me away
Will suicide break the ring of curse
Tomorrow I'll be gone so don't look for me
I am lying on my deathbed with chaos in my mind
My life took more than it gave
Betrayed and deceived I will now pass away
And with the gun in my hand my questions
Are soon to be answered
Will suicide break the ring of cure
Satan and god the thought passes my mind
Heaven and hell it's not up to me
If the Christians that I've seen
Represent the true God of heaven
Then it's not a place that I want to be
But if I'm blinded please open my eyes
And help my now
Will suicide break the ring of cure
Tomorrow I'll be gone then you'll be all alone
The assembler of souls absorbs all within his reach
His seemingly perpetual glance of doom
Would even make the smallest of serenities breach
As he rides he wind being the ghost of gloom
Running darkness all around
A knife in her hand
Fall rising screaming the name of her beloved
So weak and so weary
Something blackening her thoughts
A cloud a force a weight
Finding her true love lying in red
Is this reality or just a vision in her head
To be the knife as well as the wound
Is all that concerns her
Overwhelmed by a burden like hordes of fear
The obscurity of the vale of tears
Grasping for safety which lies all so near
Incresent malice of the vale of tears
Wandering oblivious in the foggy twilight
Shades of an obelisk shines so bright
Incredulous thoughts bewildering her mind
Is there really a god to find
Halting through the darkest of forests
The obese and extraneous at her tail
This haunting lingering to the extreme
She is about to quail
Then a formless mass of black went skyward
Stars began to fade behind a veil of dark blue velvet
She stopped she listened nothing
Silence an eternity passed
The silhouettes of something unseen a presence
The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring
The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring
Recovering of the dead
Impossible for the living
The making of a copy
Is destruction of mankind
The earth is in it's autumn
The leaves have hit the ground
Corroding this earth is dying
Not knowing you'll face the end
The coming of Christ
Is the return of X
The art of the Y
Is in the new spring
My hands in the open wound
The knife clutches near
The blood of my veins spread out
My flesh become soiled
This desperate act of loss
The pain of knowing why
My mind slips into a blur
Upcoming questions as I die
Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled
Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil
Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail
Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled
 as I die
Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil
Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail
Death is my goal / Death set me free
In my living hell I can no longer be
Please bring me back home
Where I can be free
These Cowards Awaken
To guard their dominion
Enslaved to the King
A living sacrifice
Raised to see no light
Known to no other face
He edges near with unsteady hands
Struggling to wield his blade
Advancing forth with reckless force
I witness his dismay
Sword and skin my blade will know his blood tonight
Nearly scythed by his sword flashing forward
Mine finds its way beneath his flesh
He strikes the worst has come
Fallen to my knees he looks on in triumph
He did not see my sword go through his back
No longer will the bell toll
The King will surely know
I watch his eyes go blank
His body falls from my blade
I feel my fingers tremble
As it grows closer
I wait for a chance to escape
It prowls this tomb waiting for new prey
Once human hope has all gone
Humanity has withered from behind its sunken eyes
As I wander through this nightmare
No thoughts cloud my mind
Kill or be killed
I must be the predator tonight
Wasting our lives for this
Fighting a war for nothing
Are we all so mindless
How can we cope with such catastrophe
I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light
Blood is shed and bodies strewn
Across the battlefield
Sons and fathers die in vain
Now I will rise to be their shield
Lay waste to their towering castles
Set fire to these gates
Those who are innocent will escape the storm
And those who have sinned shall pay
With their lives
Fuck their meagre existence
They will be purged
I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light
I've had enough of begging
For everything that I want
I'm sick of fighting
For what I've already earned
Dragged through the dirt
Silenced and hurt
When will this come to an end
I shall reclaim what is mine
Just give her back to me don't waste my time
I will reclaim her she's mine
No mercy for you fools who stand in line
Then I see her pale figure standing there before me
This can't be real
My eyes are bloodshot my hands are shaking
What am I supposed to feel
Take my hand or be forgotten or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love
You will be forgotten you will be lost in the storm
The chaos was begotten now dwell with your demons alone
I shall seek you dead or alive
I swear this will be the last time
Cannot forget you you're trapped in my mind
I'm done with trying I'm bringing you home
Take my hand or be forgotten or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love
You will be forgotten you will be lost in the storm
The chaos was begotten now dwell with your demons alone
She's not real
The flaw in her facade you coward
You drained the very spirit from her eyes
She lies
She calls my name with the voice of a wretched King
He invokes the collision of nations
To abuse the crown with false intention
Those who stand above him
Live beneath his reign of terror
He is not royalty he rots beneath the sky
he sits upon a throne he earned from spewing lies
He may be King but he will surely die a simple death
And I will be there till he dies with every gasping breath
The king is calling me to play his game of misery
Inside my mind I find that there's a place that he won't see
Show your fucking face I don't really think you will defy your fate
You won't look me in the eyes when you call my name
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay
You couldn't run this kingdom
If you felt further than yourself
The might of the world is against you
I'll have your head if it's the last thing I do
You won't look me in the eyes when you call my name
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay
She sits where the king once did I have seen the worst
My love once here with me she does not speak a word
You didn't have to take her from me you will know my pain
it didn't have to end this way now you will share the same fate
This hero begs for incision
He wanders aimlessly
His vision is no longer blinded by his majesty
I've taken everything and yet he still persists
Reduced him to nothing but he still fights for this
I see her face I can feel her in my arms
I've never felt so close yet so far from her before
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
To find a reason is to burden the sake of my life
A phantom follows him wherever he may go
The guilt eats him alive and scars start to show
Revenge won't bring him back
Although red is all he sees
One of us will die tonight
On that we can agree
On that we can agree
I see her face I can feel her in my arms
I've never felt so close yet so far from her before
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
But I know my face will be the last thing he sees this time
He looks to the sky in anguish
I can almost taste his hatred
A fire burns where only I can see
And he will spare no blood to get to me
Our eyes meet there is no turning back
Not now nor ever again
We made the choices that brought us here
We will pay in anger and fear
Forced to do this fucking dance of death
We cut away until there's nothing left
And with his last shred of dignity
He falls down and looks up at me
I am the god the chaos and destruction
Behold the powers of my wrath
I am the sword
The burning blade of vengeance
Your blood in my hands
As I embrace the black fire of the end
Ashes rain upon me when heaven is in flames
I am the bringer of your damnation
The judge and deliverance in one
If I say there shall be darkness
All light will die
I rule the world without a sun
With sorrow I behold the demise
The ruins of empyrium
With sorrow I behold it was fortold
When angels fall we have seen the last dawn
I am counting hours
Waiting for the sun to set below horizon
Blinded by the light until the
Darkness will fall upon me
And I become as one
Last few restless hours
Until the daylight will reach its end
I am granted with great powers
But blinded by the light until the
The pyre of gods black flame within me
Purgatory
The fire of wrath inside
I burn alive
Throw of the scent
To seize the chase of life
When one with death no light in sight
I have been told that before the end
The angels will come angels will come
Years has taken the best out of me
The sharpest edge
Endless burdensome journey without a rest
Murder in cold blood instead of a suicide
This crime is justified
I have killed myself so many times
That for me without a doubt
Heaven is denied
I am here I am waiting In silence
With no fear of dying
No more bleeding inside
Waiting for the black sun to rise
I embrace
The depths of oblivion
I am engaged to the escapeable end
The void that once was a strength
Consuming and fears
Became too intense
Destructive
I behold the days that are numbered
In my perdiction
The end has been forseen
I am unable to accept this failure
As weak as I am
I have no strength in me to pretend
The throne that once
Marked my strength
Is now a token of my failure
I can't recall
That the summer came this year before the fall
Leafs didn't grow on trees grass wasn't green
No lifesigns to be found
It's like a soundscape of silence
The final harvest has become
with bare hands we sowed the fields of ice
Lats crop that died on the ground
Into the frozen soil
Where I bury myself to be reborn
I can't recall
That the summer came this year before the fall
To The land of thousand frozen lakes
Where the endless winter without sun will bury us
Like a snowfall
I have become to question my existence
The purpose of life
The essence of the creature I am
These days will be remembered
As the dark ones
When all life withered away
Death came with me side by side
Our trail across the land
Left only void behind
I have become more than my reflection
I have overcome the sickness
The weakness of my blood
I am the plaque I am the flood
I have become more than a man
Weak flesh seals inside a god
I follow
I walk the trail
Of my shadow
It walks ahead
Leading away
From the light
Darkness walks beside me
Drifting away
In your now so seeking eyes
The taste of confidence
In my mouth
I want to give you
More than I can
Stuck in ourselves and the distance doesn't change
Words from you
Is a touching expression
Haunting
Bitterness
Is tearing me down
To be with you
Is to be with the world
Untitled reasons are carried with the wind
That autumn night we could have gone to the stars
But you leave me
With that stolen look of love
These days I hear our hearts beating as one
And you know for me
You will never be gone
Does love come wrapped in lies
Am I flying just to fall
And as I grow older
Life seems so much more colder
It's not a secret of mine
That I want love to really hurt me
Your bright smile at dusk
And all my love is blown to bits
Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you
Our words are so far apart
Mine broken yours full of dreams
But let me find you in those dreams
And take you home tonight
Do you think the sky will ever part
And leave a tiny hope of love
For us to hold on
But to what why or who
Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you
Serenity
And the ice cold feeling
Of an uncertain future
Spark glow in the dark
Waiting for no one
At the halls of tomorrow
Surrender may I
But only if you beat me twice
Beat me twice
I can't see through
Your lies and your crying eyes
your crying eyes
So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die
Would you believe a word I'd say
If it was true
if it was true
Could you challenge your horizons
Into a voice of silence
a voice of silence
Wherever you may fall
I'm falling with you
falling with you
And whenever you may leave
I'm leaving with you
leaving with you
So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die
And so the day went
We had our time
Now we met at the park in July
I took your hand and held it high
I dreamt that this love
Could be undone
We shared our feelings
We had our moments
Maybe you were the one
No love can ever have a place in me
I'm closing in
On myself
Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate
And so the day went
We had our days
Now we were at the park in July
You took my heart and held it high
I thought that this love
Could now be done
And so the night went
The moon was full
Now we slept at the park in July
We took our lives and nailed them to the ground
I knew that this life
Could now be gone
Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate 
Trying to see but can't break through
Silver skies talks to me like ghosts of the past
Ignoring call from electric skies
And the house of cards
Fall to the ground death
Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still lost in the white lines
Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
A December could only apply to myself
Going to the lake of freedom but water is to cold to swim
I can go back but I can't move
Temptation can burn
But will I drown
Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
Nu tændes himlens dybe glød
Og natten kommer fløjlsblød
De drømmende går snart til ro
På mælkevejens stjernebro
Du længes i mørket mod
Dage med håb og lys
Du kan ikke sove
En nat bliver det sommer
En fjern og fin musik
Giver dig alt du aldrig fik
Ja netop nu ved midnatstid
En engel kommer ren og hvid
Med kærlighed som engle flest
Og hvem er den hun elsker mest
Du længes i mørket mod
Dage med håb og lys
Du kan ikke sove
En nat bliver det sommer
En fjern og fin musik
Giver dig alt du aldrig fik
And so may I be the next to know
Knowing the times before they are
Are they deep timeless wanderings and the mace of wrath
In these evenings
The blood seems to boil
Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white
I'm still the one I used to be
But the age of this fiery obsession has been too long
It's now colder than the freezing mind of you
Alive and glowing
Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white
Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
And heaven will know the taste of rain
Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
And heaven will know the taste of rainWelcome to the opposite of all your opposites
No matter where you go you will always be dead
I bring you to the slaughtering of life
I focused on confinement to trade for your time you scream
This world will pay for your death and we all will laugh when your losing your final breath I don't care
How much of yourself I wanting the freedom you will not and will never taste it
All this time all this time all this time traded for nothing
All this time has given my hurt with the blood that is on my hands
To a spiteful god confined slaughtering of my internal pride damn this life a broken deal of time
Bring you to your grave your name has been erased
Your name has been erased confined slaughtering of me
Wait for your blood why I burn innocence can not be alive
We pay for your time for time burn for your life you will learn
All the confined slaughter of me I don't see through the bars of this disease
I live it without a life without a life a better life 
I scream goodbye love to a dead world goodbye
I have to be your wrong answer we loathe this night
It is not what it is supposed to be a better tie to burn
The cold is in my heart created a better me will you accept despise
You why you loathe me I have become regrets
Why you loathe me I focus on all the pain
I cannot begin to feed endlessly
I have got a better dream without you being apart of me
I force a broken reclaim upon my hands the blood of a saint
I set myself free from this and all disease the winter will take you away
Low below the ground you will find me
Under grave snow on my head stone
Low below the ground you will find me
I do not want to know anybody's fucking name
I do not want to hear about anyone else's pain
I cannot sustain much of society's ways
I cannot believe unless it is right in front of me
Cannot stopcannot trust cannot back away
Keep quiet do not speak only I can say
You cannot have a word in this your sorrow becomes my bliss
I witnessed a mass destruction a fatal war fought for society's construction
You have no better direction this will be your fucking lesson
It is all about you you know it's a fact
It is all about you why is that
Only the enemies know about my revenge
Only few have told the story and lived
Only the ones like this have blood to shed
Only to this world will you always be dead
Fuck you all it all comes down to you what is named to be true
I have found a separate fixation I have stomped the ground's impression
All focused upon bettering one's self all your turmoil brought upon by guilt
It slowly changes by hope of life fucked yourself by wasting time
Cannot escape your own labyrinth of strain
Feebleminded you cannot have what you may
I have realized it was all about you I comply to trying to fuck you
It is all about you you know that's a fact
It is about you why is that
Instant change from sane to rage unlocked my kindred evil
Fortunate to know the passage I crawled through pins and needles
Enough of this unmeasurable pain all this anger too much too sustain in my veins
Blood boils at a different degree this is the true honesty of what I need
Unknown follow the path I have shown
Capable spite can only be my real label
Face down smell the entrance to my grave
Unrestrained focused to make life my slave
It goes into my wretched core same forced feeling as before not anymore
I will not put up with this shit this burning hate my life has accept
Does anyone understand what pressure weighs this man
Does he have a plan does he have to live
Are you able to hear subliminal welcoming to fear
Why be afraid to be near what is left to give
Does he have to live what is left to give
My beautiful burning hate
Decadence the way I feel about my inner self
Pestilence a sickness I cannot rid of
A hatred that I fell in love a weakness within the system
A saviour has made me a victim a coward that has lived his day
A murderer who escaped his ways a survivor I have not fell apart
At peace with the hate in my heart
Does it matter all the pieces of your life you have lost
My presence is shattered open to you for all it cost
It is an honest opinion an ignorant decision a life ending incision
This is what always burned this your messiah will have to learn
Inside this lonely mind hides another danger you cannot deny
All this is another focus on my madness
Explain it attempted misery addicted sadness
All my torment can it be described all my torment will it leave from inside
All this is another focus on my madness
Explain it attempted misery addicted sadness
All my struggle can it be justified all my struggle amplified why
Every day another struggle every day lived in fucking torment
All these fears made up of nothing all my life tricked into killing myself and the shit about me
Fuck this world and all around me for being in my life and wasting my time
I bury the remains I end it with my own life I end it with my own life
Failure incompetence rejection resistance this is my natural torment
End time witness end time never alive
Ever find calming all that is forming time no time for lies again
Endless at fault betrayal cause I try to find a better place
Writhe forever always held together
All I am wanting never mine it is still longing inside
All the pain's pride dies crucified unless I find life
Access to life all found inside the veins where blood flows
Don't you ever see forbidden agony alive
All I am forming ties all before me don't you lie
Inside my head you must see endless betrayal for nothing in me
Awful love come to me break the rules bend the bones revenge with shame
Love for me died long ago everywhere I look
Another reason to show why I hate found in everyone the damage of a god
Only believe in shit He does not fucking exist why I burn alive burnWake up my friend it's time to go to the battle of our ancestors
your blood will shed but your death it is the price we have to pay
The glory of our elder ones is the flame that burns in chest of ours
the light is blessed and shines ahead the enemies will die
Of the knowledge of my grandfather's side
the sword is forged and it will be mine
At the dawn I take my horse and pride
and to the victory I will ride
The autumn leaves falling again
Through the eyes of a bird is this scenery seen
How the beauty turns into darkness
And how everything is lost once again
Years have passed since someone grew the flowers
Bare hate and madness are left everything stays still
The place was designed for this
Once it was dwelling for a success
But now is a grave for a story such a sad to tell
She waited for him at the doorway so anxious
She loved him so deeply that she couldn't see
Finally he came and looked right into her eyes
And fired his gun straight into her heart
So crash the dreams of a young one
This life was gone to never return
She started into his eyes at the moment of her death
And that's the sight to haunt him forever
Deepness and darkness are lost in this coldness of hatred
Dream of the loved one has turned into a dream to last for eternity
Cold blooded murder and waste of a life was the only way
The time stood still and the silence covered the fire
Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away
Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away
It all begins from this point and it's the point for all this to end
Every story has got an ending but his is the one
That keeps going without it
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me
I pull the trigger to escape
I have followed the path and walked through the door
I have hated you so much but now I know
It would be pointless forevermore
Countless nights spent on just pacing under the streetlights
This is the part of the play where the hero is sentenced to death
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me
I pull the trigger to escape
Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge
No difference has been found
No difference that I madeSlowly fading image is projected on the surface of the earth
Resemble of the past falling under the foundations of a new era
What is the achievement of men so great that really makes the difference
At the scale of the universe we are nothing but bare dust
Nothing more than dust
Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that can´t be denied are lost
Can´t you see that nothing really matters
Can´t you see what you are doing
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system
Setting the traps ahead of us wherever we could fall
So every conclusion is built on empty basis
World is a reflection of contradictions and is just an illusion
The ordinariness of waking up and going to work like programmed inside
Once you look at it all from objective angle you see how it all works
Master the art of channeling your thinking through the unusualchannels
And become the one with understanding realize it and program them yourself
Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that can´t be denied are lost
Can´t you see that nothing really matters
Can´t you see what you are doing
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system
Setting the traps ahead of us wherever we could fall
So every conclusion is built on empty basis
World is a reflection of contradictions and is just an illusion
Slowly fading image is projected on the surface of the earth
Resemble of the past falling under the foundations of a new era
What is the achievement of men so great that really makes the difference
At the scale of the universe we are nothing but bare dust
Taken my time and gotten only what I´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within
Reflection back burns like hell
I didn´t win so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow it´s me who to follow
In sight a despair strong thinking it´s all wrong
I shouldn´t have let go no way  I know
Her eyes I see as I close my mind
Opening my soul for her to bind
The riddler comes to me to ask
Do you have to hide behind your mask
I am not the same I used to be
And now I feel painfully free
Have to forget all the rain
Just to recall the infernal pain
People change I know they do
Yet I can´t change my point of view
No answer to all questions asked
So pack your bags and finish the task
and die
Many deeds with no meaning at all
Even so I stand tall
And without a fear I shed no tear
And face what is to come
No more back against the wall
No more roaming the empty hall inside my head
Where all is dead where shines no light ahead
Out in the distance for back lies
The essence of life and highest dreams
Behind the point of knowledge
Where the sense of truth so pure and fine
Is cast into the endless time
Taken my time and gotten only what I´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within
Reflection back burns like hell
I didn´t win so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow it´s me who to follow
Yet no pitch black letters shall be written
For the future reveals its curtain
I´ve heard the eager call from down below
But I´ll stand tall not letting go
No pitch black letters
I´ll stand tall
Not letting go
Will let go
Flashbacks from the war
Calm silence before the fight
Snowy road covered in blood
Suicide by my side
You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore
Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Just one look through my eyes should be enough for you
Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished
Hearing echoes from the eternity
Still fighting only the enemy differs
Once a soldier so great now afraid of death
One great enemy of men
Forgotten and buried deep those words will be
Time takes it´s own guaranty's freedom
The last fight is to take place at the frontiers of human mind
Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Just one look through my eyes should be enough for you
Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished
Weak fire burning on
And the last chapter is soon ready
But the quill drops from his hands
And the story remains unwritten forever
You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore
Finally I can see it all so clear
The lies and contorted reality
It took so long to realize it
But now I am free from their chains
I know I´m all alone
But I don´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane
I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the world´s balance
Because I see it all now
I´ve lost these many years
The lost one who´s shed too many tears
Must recall revelation in the dark
For past and future for all under my mark
I´ve been drowned I´ve been crowned
I´ve been dead and yet so blind
I have reached the end of my path
The knowledge the wisdom behind my wrath
I thought it was all right then
But now I´ll put an end to it
They knew that one day I´ll find out
There´s no way to make it undone
I know I´m all alone
But I don´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane
I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the world´s balance
Because I see it all now
Everytime I wake up you´re beside me
Every moment I feel you in my arms
But as soon as I open my eyes
You are gone like a frail dust in the wind
Again
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
This is the silent song of the dead
Hear the violins play now And fall
Everytime I wake up I see you there
Every moment I look out of the window
Your smile I see behind the mask
But soon the image disappears and
I´m alone again
I´m alone again
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
When the winds are gathered in one place
When the darkness spreads and no one stands
I am the fragment of an illusion in the silent room
And I am the lost page of the book that the old man
Never could complete
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
The autumn leaves falling again
Through the eyes of a bird is this scenery seen
How the beauty turns into darkness
And how everything is lost once again
Years have passed since someone grew the flowers
Bare hate and madness are left everything stays still
The place was designed for this
Once it was dwelling for a success
But now is a grave for a story such a sad to tell
She waited for him at the doorway so anxious
She loved him so deeply that she couldn´t see
Finally he came and looked right into her eyes
And fired his gun straight into her heart
So crash the dreams of a young one
This life was gone to never return
She started into his eyes at the moment of her death
And that´s the sight to haunt him forever
Deepness and darkness are lost in this coldness of hatred
Dream of the loved one has turned into a dream to last for eternity
Cold blooded murder and waste of a life was the only way
The time stood still and the silence covered the fire
Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn´t know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away
Into the sleep of the darkness eternal her eyes are now closed
And she sleeps in a silence so cold
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn´t know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories
The justice is just how it is seen
And the concept is good for nothing but to fade away
It all begins from this point and it´s the point for all this to end
Every story has got an ending but his is the one
That keeps going without it
I´ve been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me
I pull the trigger to escape
I have followed the path and walked through the door
I have hated you so much but now I know
It would be pointless forevermore
Countless nights spent on just pacing under the streetlights
This is the part of the play where the hero is sentenced to death
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge
I´ve been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me
I pull the trigger to escape
Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world
This is called my reality and it is just my dream
The hate so pure is the life of me and it is what I am
Every step towards you takes me towards to my end
The truth is now revealed and I am standing at the edge
No difference has been found
No difference that I made
Realize the very truth that compromises all we know all we care
And though the shadows are everywhere
I have come to greater understanding of all the aspects of life
You see my friend the universe is sentient aware alive
It´s all so simple that way
To live again just another day
But we possess something that can´t be found
The one and only truth in which they all will be drowned
The revolution of our kind is the center of the progression
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
Claim the kingdom of a thousand stars just for yourself
Use all the means to make the world yours again
The revolution of our kind is the center of the progression
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
We see into the forthcoming day
Our minds are open wide Eyes open wide
And they can´t force us regardless of pain
To be like them again
All these hours were there waiting for you
But the time was running years ahead of you
There´s no sign for salvation in the end
There is no gate to let you in
This is the beginning of a new day
So claim the time and lead the way
Heavenly light that now shines ahead
Is the proof of the new beginning and the end
There´nothing for you here
Follow your people and leave these lands
The hope has forsaken this place
The ship is waiting for you
Please take my word
Our time here is at its end
I have no light or darkness left in my eyes anymore
To see the future I´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
Now my spirit has weakened and will soon fade away
My sire your name will always be at the hearts of your people
Leave now there´s still time for you
Forget your consort it´s time to go
Silence has surrounded me everything that can be seen
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees
I have no light or darkness left in my eyes anymore
To see the future I´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
Now my spirit has weakened and will soon fade away
My sire your name will always be at the hearts of your people
You are the only one left anymore
All the others are gone
Abandoned cities and sinister landscape
Is your kingdom now
Silence has surrounded me everything that can be seen
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees
From time to time I feel the same again
The sorrow and the hate for this world
Thousands of sleepless nights in the endless rain
Many days just thinking all these lies
And all this hatred in me
Many days just thinking all these lies
And I am nothing but a lie
The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program life
Far beyond the light I am
I´m running as fast as I can
But the world slowly fades away
And so do I
The reason is the blade of mine
The answer is the fear of time
The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program life
Is this what we have been searching for
Is this all what we have been waiting for
This is only a joke nothing else this can not be
All the people and the time and the ordinary life is what we see
How can they be so stupid they can not see
What the fuck have I done so evil that I´m born here free
So I´m born here at the feet of this monster statue
The fear of truth is so hard that they refuse from it
And my personal worldend
It doesn´t mean just death
And my last words for the mankind
Are vanished with the world itself
Star of Darkness shine on me
let satanic shadows draw near
the hour of eternal evil here
and I am facing the black circle
see my blasphemous torture
that you lit with darkness
the witches must be gathered
and to stand in your light
star of evil winds shine
let your shadow down on me
hear me cry out infernal names
near the circle of Ninnvam
the black eclipse draws closer
the witches are gathered
I dream fantasies of torture
and fornication before God
Diabolical night dwell our souls
let your evil shadows draw nearer
to possess our immortal flesh
and to breed abominations
You are the shadows dancing in the mist
You are the fire lightening the blackened skies
you goddess of sin
that have torched my soul
you are the raging wind blowing through the pagan lands
you are the lust and essence of my being
you goddess of death
that painted my heart with darkness
you are the hatred running through my veins
you are my hunger for the purest blood
you goddess of vampiric evil
that granted me thy life eternal
You are the pale moonlight reflected in my eyes
you are the wolves howling echoing through the night
you nocturnal goddess
that granted me demonic powers
you are the twilight in the infernal storms
you are the despain in every enemy´s soul
you goddess of war
that gave my life a meaning
you are the blasphemy in every sin
you are the pain called love that I cannot feel
you blasphemic goddes
that killed my emotions
oh you goddess of the eclipse
that dwells within me
oh you apocalyptical goddess
I worhip thee
Standing on a moonlit field
cold rain whipping my skin
warm blood draining me of life
oh I feel my death draw near
The pale moonlight is reflected
in the steel that has opened my veins
my life is now fading away
into the deepest of shadows
now it is time to end this mortal life
I kneel and welcome my death
my eyes are blinded by the fire
which has been feared for centuries
here I will burn for my sins
still there is nothing I regret
death is my deliverance
from this pain called living
with a sigh of relief I die
thrown into the raging fire
laughing as I burn
oh dark ruler of the fallen
this is my final sacrifice
I grant thee my life
The pentagram of my desires fullfillment
glows with inverted unholy inner force
baphomet I draw your sign deep inte my flesh
enter me and use my satanic body for war
Grant me a touch through Leviathan
set fire to my soul of AntiChrist
God of the underworld split open my black heart
fill me with unholiness and color my soul in hate
fever runs through my blasphemous being
I am my sacrificial gift to the goatlord
I cry out to thee Baphomet appear in me
create a storm of immolation to kill God
possess me now and see all my hatred
I am a human torch of devestation
master of teh grim domains I call your names
while I rape the angels of an impotent God
He weeps like a lamb to the slaughter
cast down from his blooddrenched skies
slowly we sail across the river Styx
and I hold up his head by the hair
the godforsaken water is bloodred
and the ruler of chaos stands ashore
he spreads out his blackened wings
and blasphemes sadistically the priest
I drag the worthless priest ashore
he screams endlessly in naked fear
I am an eternal veil of evil torture
and I take pleasure in his agony
he is being crucified upon a cross
and boiling blood is poured upon him
his face explodes in bursting heat
as I whip his soul a thousand times
Summoning voices from distant fields
calling for magic of Satanic might
In midnight storms and thunder
around flaming stakes the witches dance
A fork of lightening cracks the sky
like a blaze in the winternight
still heard are the hymns
the hymns invocing Satan
The light of day is now cursed by Him
and united is his warrior hordes
the pale cold light of the moon and the stars
now blessed by he who reigns in flames
so creature of the night behold
hold with pride your banners black
and to thos that tremble in fear
His voice speaks with thundering might
I have given life to shadows grim
and blessed this world with darkness
now kneel and swear allegiance to me
for the future to come is mineCaught on an asteroid the size of a planet
Bacterial remnants of humans traverse the stars
As we fall through holes in time
Beneath glares of stars burning
Void of eternal night unfurl
Out beyond the threshold
In worlds yet known to man
Lurking near the portal's gate
Where black holes burn away
VENIT MORS TE SUPERARE
BONUM EST MORTIS MEDITARI
Dimensions shattered by tombs of time
Collapse the galaxy on human life
Outside they wait to cloud the gateway
From beyond I see the nothing
The field which chains all being
Levitated somehow made weightless
Moved by some unknown device
Synthetic gravitational environment
Adrift in the cosmic tide of ice
Lost to the abyssal waves of time
Floating eternally with one open eye
Cryogenically contained living without life
Celestial epitaph for all of mankind
Far below the earth
Beneath the caverns
Beyond the light
Dwells the terrestrial race
And forms of life
Beyond those known to man
Suffocating aura emanating decay
Limbless horror radiates
The fetied reek of plague
Planets burning away
Celestial bodies decay
Planetary funeral
As world go up in flames
Tides of blood for sacrifice
To their alien names
Born of blood and starspawn
In times beneath the earth
Siphoning the life source
Of humans their birthFalling Fall through the stargate within
but is this the first or the last time again
Opening between the gates on either side
Spiraling Awaken in another mind
Fall Through nothingness
Suffocating
The glass freezes inside your veins
Die Release your flesh to the astral plane
The violent plain of suffering
Your blood has vitrified
Boiling the pulp beneath
Liquefy your mind
Fear the pain
Fire awaits
Buried
Underneath the sand in the desert
Opening how the ancients foretold
Glowing
With the light of god in the temple
Offering thou to the astral beast
They came to mine the planet
For those who live under the ground
Inside the synthetic world we know
As the human mind
These beings are hiding outside of time
Tethering starseeds inside your mind
Rotten seeds grown inside astral beings from beyond
Corrupting your DNA
To make your soul obsolete
Replicating inside thoughts
To make your inner self fall asleep
Caught between the empty fields of time
And dimensions that are lost
To the worlds we know as real
Feel the bile churning away
Mold the substance
To send through the gate
Cosmic seas of fire traverse the void of space
Bringing human souls from another world
Manipulate the species from inside
Watch them fight and kill
To build the megacemetery urns of the planet
In this lachrymose universe
Of anfractuous dimensions
No death as known
Only doorways
You are the stargateThey return back with the ancient spirits
They return back to kill the living
They return back to take this Earth
They return back to take their own world
Now you can see the ancient magick
Now you can see the ancient gods
Now you can see the ancient spirits
Now you can see the ancient gods
When we closed them in the abyss
They said We'll return back
And now they are in front of men
Now they want to take their land
When I look around my life
I see damned souls they don't survive
I see young people they always cry
They have no values don't know the light
In your eyes
Tears of lies
You cry and die
Tears of lies
When I look into your face
I see depression I see no faith
I see young people they always cry
They have no values don't know the light
Rituals magick
I enjoy me with every excess
To free my soul to free my heart
To free my mind of shit
And I know that I will die
I'm waiting to see the end
If you know what is the light
You have no fear of death
I enjoy my life
Yes I know that I will die
And I never cry
But I know that I will die
Die die
Yes I know that I will die
Rituals magick
I prepare me to my return
I prepare my soul I prepare my heart
I prepare me to cry no more
You that try to take
All the stupid men
You would like to put
Your hatred in myself
You don't need a God
You don't need a men
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else
Prince of darkness
You're nothing in my life
Hey prince I know your name
I don't fear all that you say
You like to see the death
You like to see all black
You like to see
The decline of men
You think that I don't know
That you rule this world
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else
I would like to know
What reality is
I would like to know
What life is for me
'cause I spent all my life
Running behind my dreams
And every time
I ran behind my faith
I ran behind my faith
Sometimes you need someone near of you
Sometimes you need solitude
You can find yourself and you don't need no one
You can find your faith and you can walk alone
I try to know myself
I try with every excess
I try to fall into a trance
I invoke the spirits of dead
When I invoke my spirit guide
I feel his power inside my veins
I feel his knowledge into my brain
And I keep it inside of me behind my faith
Do you believe in a living dead
Do you believe in the other side
Do you believe that we return back
Do you believe that we cannot die
So look at the cemetery
And tell me what you see
In the graves there is nobody
But believe me this is real
The graves are open
The graves are open now
And now we are returning back
To show you what's the life
There is no end with the death
The beginning is in the other side
I don't know where is the knowledge
I want to know where's my conscience
So I look at my heart
And I find all the answers
It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul
I want to know the mean of life
I want to know where's the light
So I look at my soul
And I understand what I am
It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul occultum lapidem
I'm not blind and I can see
The great light of my will
I look for peace for my mind
I look for pleasures that I've inside
I that live my spiritual tale
I don't want toopen your eyes
I just want to show you these lies
They try to use your faith and your mind
Stolen faith stolen faith
They say Give us your money and pray
They say You must believe in our faith
I say Give us a reason to pray
You say Give me back my stolen faithNazarene
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
Resent me
Sworn enemy of the weakened heart
Cursing the miracle
Leech of the sun
Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way
Wage the war
Madness awakes and reveals its face
Truly immeasurable
Hidden in all
Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn
Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way
Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn
Nazarene
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
We're born to reign as masters
To ashes we'll burn the pastures
Repell their ways back to nothingness
Chaos in symmetry
This glorious victory
In darkness only we can see
Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn
Transcend with rage of the elite
The new order come to rise and shine rise and shine
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside
Defiled bloodlines severed
The lowlife's doom endeavoured
The sheep of masses trampled under our march
Set out to lead and create
This power indulge our fate
This era calls for annihilation
Our whispers outsound prayers
We claimwhat was never theirs
Sworn to the triumph of darkness
Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn
Transcend with rage of the elite
The new order come to rise and shine rise and shine
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside
Down insects bow to me
Die insects too blind to see
Down disgusting foul flea
Die we remove the life of thee
Foul prayers rise
Staring through the eye of the chasm
Still at rest but breathing
Enemy be born
Grant us knowledge of the opposition
Spew forth from the earth
Contagious is the one from which the wisdom comes
So sworn
Hibernation draws to a close
Lacerating wings unfold
Hunger will cease
Abominations speak from the dark
Now seek only death
Antichrist
Rise before us
Pain
From inside
Release them
Souls in slavery
Come my saviour now
Face is the one of a reptile
Rotting teeth and lips
Speaking words of sick salvation
Whispering eclipse
Antichrist
Rise before us
Pain
From inside
Release them
Souls in slavery
Come my saviour now
Cast into the lake of fire
Gagged by blood
A thousand deaths unwind
Storming
Perseverance is none
Repenting not
Mass decay of life
Swarming
Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praise
Trapped inside a burning field
Sheep of god
Followers who did not heed
The warning
Unblessing of the purity
Once the norm
Darkness holds the blasphemy
Swarming
Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praise
Insanity will reign supreme
Azazel
Belial
Abaddon
Leviathan
Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praiseNew trend is coming
At Kellys' I saw the girls slimming
Bringing in tampons drenched in vodka
Then the party started to rocka'
I was sexually aroused
By these naked girls
Inserting their compacted
Tubular shaped pieces of cotton
Into their vaginas and anuses
Yeah
The strings hanging out of their labia
Getting piss drunk
All these fish tacos dripping alcohol
Thought I was in heaven
They were bending over
Showing me their brown eyes
Moisty wet and surely succulent
And I could choose any any slice
So I got out my hard implement
Slimming party at Kellys'
I pushed it hard Up to their bellies
Slimming party at Kellys'
My dick accompanied me in endless rallies
Slimming at Kellys'
Think this trend is a good thing
Slimming at Kellys'
Hell of a night full of swingUp on the hill
looking down at me
The hoards are waiting
for the guilty to be
Sentenced to death
Blood sport
feel the thrill of the chaise
Heart is fit to bursting
at the deadly pace
Hard to draw breath
I am the prey
it's jungle law
Fight to survive
tooth fang and claw
Wild dogs behind
see snarling jaws
Running man
breaking free
The hounds of hell
are after me
The gibbet waits
or to take my head
Will I make it
Or will I be dead
I'm the running man
I'm the running man
I am yeah
Running man
I'm the running man
Understand
In for the kill
sprint for the line
Can't break my will
race against time
Life flashing by
Hunted the pack
are closing in
I hear them howling
Maybe I can't win
but I've gotta try
I swore an oath
dragged to the floor
My ghost will haunt
this windy moor
Forever free
through blood and gore
Running man
breaking free
The hounds of hell
are after me
The gibbet waits
or to take my head
Will I make it
Or will I be dead
Nobody helped me
nobody even knows my name
Fighting bravely
even though I died in vain
Whoa
Running man
breaking free
The hounds of hell
are after me
The gibbet waits
or to take my head
Will I make it
Or will I be dead
I'm running still
On this cold and lonely
wiley windy hill
The seer has a message
it spells out a warning
Foretold of evil
from times early dawning
Lilith is her name
she'll drive you insane
From hell spawn she came
to find you
She tells you damnation
is nothing to fear
Proclaims revelations
is already here
Black are her eyes
beguiling with lies
With blood lust she cries
let the night games begin
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Daughter of darkness
banished from Eden
She is the succubus
lays down with demons
Lucifer's child
restless and wild
A harlot defiled
blind fool
Queen of seduction
bewitching the priests
Lust and corruption
the mark of the beast
Haunting your dreams
insidious schemes
She laughs at your screams
the nightmare won't end
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
She'll take you to the alter
like a human sacrifice
Easy virtue incarnate
she's a mistress of the night
Priestess of seduction
she's all your body needs
Eat you alive
fuck you till you bleed
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Roll on up take a look at me
just a sideact novelty
Circus clown in the public gaze
nameless horror to be
feared and caged
Behind this mask of deformity
there's a son of humanity
Formed by natures twisted hand
they call me monster
But I'm a man
Everything I touch
everything I see
Everything I feel
crumbles before me
I am not a dog
I do all I can
Can't you understand
Wanna fit in with the likes of you
Set me free
let me go
Want to belong
I need to grow
But you treat me like a
freak show
Freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show
Freak show
Mirror your insecurity
imperfect scarred
just leave me be
Need a place where I can hide
no one sees the wretch inside
Stripped of pride and dignity
mocked by cruel society
Thought you were my only friend
now I can see you just pretend
Everything I knew
everything I crave
Everything I do
brings me closer to my grave
Too grotesque to live
but too young to die
Madness cruelty reigns
torment clouds my brain
Hatredwhy is it so
Need to belong
someone you should know
But you treat me like a freak show
Freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show
Freak show
What do you want from me
Cut me do I not bleed
I'm every bit as good as you
Out castbeat down betrayed
Lost in a world I never made
I'm insane after all they put me through
Set me free
Let me go
Want to belong
I need to grow
Oh they can't even look me
Right in the face
Subhuman
Let me show you
the creature I've become
The evil that torments the soul
when prejudice is done
Freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show
Freak show
Freak
freak
freak

You treat me like a freak show
freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show

Voice over
Roll up roll up
See the inhuman monstrosities
Ladies and gentlemen
I give you FREAKS
Too bad the boy can't sing
but kids today'll buy anything
Sweet meat
supplying trash on demand
for a few dollars more
In the back of a hand
You'll go far It's true
every two bit actors
a rock n' roll star
In the charts on the news
with millions screaming
all over you
It's Prime Time

Doing prime time
Slave to convention
overnight sensation

You'll find

Red hot the kid can play
but where's the pay off
at the end of the day
Looses heart
playing one night stands
Never got a deal
soon quit the band
He was good
goes to show
It ain't what you do
it's who you know
That's the catch 22
when the doors are closed
you'll never break through

You'll find

It's a fashion reaction
Pigeon hole philosophy
The people only get
what we want them to see
Gonna sell 'em the illusion
till it hurts and they'll pay
A little bit of hype goes a long
long way
Foundations of rock
Have feet of clay
Gone tomorrow

Prime time honey
Never pay no heed to those
who oppose my lifestyle
Feel no remorse for the wrong
that I've done
I constantly abuse all who try
to use me
Like a fallen angel banished
from the sun
Cause I'm the Night Stalker
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attack
Prowling these streets at night
I fight a deadly game of survival
Stealing through the concrete
jungle with bloodlust in my
brain
All here fear me I'm ruthless
as I'm godless
A preadtor of the side walk in
his alleyway domain
Cause I'm the Night Stalker
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attack
Society brands me a homicidal
madman but they cannot
cage what they cannot see
When I'm coming you as
good as a dead man
Ain't no one alive that can
elude me
Cause I'm the Night Stalker
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attackEvery last blind pulled when I walk down the street
The only sound I hear is my tired heartbeat
Sometimes I feel just like a motherless child
This place once had a name
The people once had faces
In every town I find it's the same sad situation
Sometimes I feel just like a countryless man
My father tried to break me my mother she tried to raise
The county correct me from my wild ways
I once saw figures about a mile off
So I waited in the woods until they were gone
Sometimes I feel just like a wandering dog
My father tried to break me my mother she tried to raise
The county correct me from my wild ways
Struck down by a vision of beauty
Said I was struck down by a long legged archer
Oh the city was hot but my blood ran cold
Oh the city went dark keep calm and carry on
I was a young man only 19 years old
I was a young man so very far away from home
Ah she got me struck down right through the heart struck down
Ah she shot me struck down right through the heart struck down
Keep calm and carry on reefer madness quiets the falling bomb
I want to be an old man damn you von Braun
I've been laid low by a blinding light
I've been torn asunder by the banshee's wail
Ah she got me struck down right through the heart struck down
Ah she shot me struck down right through the heart struck down
Keep calm and carry on reefer madness quiets the falling bomb
I was a young man only 19 years old
I was a very young man so very far away from home
I was imprisoned by a vision of beauty
I was struck down by the long legged archer
Keep calm and carry on reefer madness quiets the falling bomb
Airstreams tethered together like silver sleeping oxen
All the best locations are located on the margins
Suited for telescoping the interstellar scene
It's a mean killer in the daylight but that's life for you and me
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts
Anthrax ham radio and liquor
What if I told you they been lying
About that double wide with water rights
And now the town cars are back again
They sold you some old line
About the greater good and sacrifice
Your friends from Langley are back again
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts
Anthrax ham radio and liquor
Coming at you live
It's just some people can only see the stars
In the reflection from big black cars
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts
Oh Abraham Lincoln carried across the street
Oh Abraham Lincoln carried across the street
The assassin the coward
shot him in the head
The assassin the serpent
Struck him then he fled
Oh many many many people gather to hear the word
Oh many many many people tremble at what they've heard
Snickering drunkards from cover of dark
Treachery's their master
murder is their heart
From the table rips his chair
Cross the people on the stairs
Watch the limbs running for
All across a empty bar
Oh Abraham Lincoln buried him in his grave
Oh Abraham Lincoln buried him in his grave
The assassin the coward no grave for you
The assassin the actor no applause for you
From the table rips his chair
Cross the people on the stairs
Watch the limbs running for
All across a empty bar
In a city of crooked alleys
Crookeder women and wicked men
Dim lamps in the rumor mill
Suspicious kith and unkind kin
Haruspectre General
Sleeping soldiers in the field
Below the elders conspire
To turn the merciless and massive wheel
Strange cousins from the west overstay their welcome
Locked in among skeletons
Broken hearted and damned
Sorry to have to break it to you friend
But life seldom goes exactly as we plan
Strange cousins from the west overstay their welcome
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them
The city's always thriving
Hungry bellows of the Minotaur
Everyday more are arriving
And everyday it requires more
Unexpected circumstance
We must not delay
You have all been so very very kind to us
And we will return the favor one day
Fate is the idiot's excuse
Freedom is the sucker's dream
But we hope you find some measure of comfort
In considering us to be your family
Strange cousins from the west overstay their welcome
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them
In the raining park the chessmen play
The faithful atheists refuse to pray
The steamworks weep the addicts do not care
Crowd of cold people stand by and stare
The garbage eaters their many retainers
Come to collect all the foul remainders
The smoke hangs heavy the wrecking ball swings
In the clockwork of a collapsing thing
Wasted plastic empire's golden age chemical wedding
Citizens in their refineries cheer the nuptial bedding
The hourglass is turning
On a shore of iron cutters and clippers
Paper rock rock paper and scissors
On a road of skulls their story moves on
It's a bumpy ride and very very very long
In the blue sky the seagulls fly over garbage
Are we the ocean Are we the desert
Are we the garbage Who's to say
I'm gonna move to the outskirts of town
Where none of your friends are hanging around
That's right I'm gonna move to the other side of town
Where none of your business is hanging around
Woman please let a poor man be Let a poor man be
Columbia girl please let a poor man be Let a poor man be
I'm gonna build a castle out of Goodyear tires
Cinderblock and busted doors that's where I'll retire
Gonna dig a mote Fill it up with ale
Not much of a defense I know but the supply never fails
When you come knocking all in tears wringing hands and genuflecting
You'll understand that I am a busy man and my subjects demand my attention
These walls don't build themselves and I am running out of time
So if you desire anything else you had better get in line
What kind of ugly are they talking about
It's just straight up cold evil
What kind of nonsense are they going on about
Do they suffer from the fever
Nothing's gonna satisfy them
Till it all goes Chernobyl
No nothing's ever really gonna satisfy them
Until the virus goes mobile
If you didn't then well now you know
Outside is an army of antlers
I hate to say it but I told you so
Only the freaks have all the answers
Red threat Helicopters SuperMindControl
Stockholm Syndrome Love your captors
Uranium SuperMindControl
It's gonna rain rain down in buckets
Watch it happen a natural fact
They're gonna lose and their not gonna like it
Watch it happen Supernatural act
I send pictures through the mail
Well documented and very detailed
To politicians and big celebrities
But none of them are believing in me
And I await their response
Some send none most send cops
But man it's a dire situation
And I will risk the public humiliation
Sleestak lightning on my trail
It's a dire situation they are on my trail
West Virginia has its Moth Man
Pan handlers' got their Skunk Ape
But I have a tazer and night vision goggles
Costco rolls of black duct tape
It's got red eyes it's got razor claws
It's got green skin no it ain't a methhead
And after studying its behavior objectively and critically
I believe I have a reliable methodPath ingrained fall face first into nothingness
All roads lead me to selfdestruct
Veins are maps paving way to the abyss
Up is down and from this there is no escape
Drown down and out
Gates without keys eyes without holes
Life without answers a corpse with no soul
Born under the worst sign Revelations of an innocence lost
From the cubicle to the casket life is a mere lottery of loss
This code of damnation ineffable to in it's beauty 
My race to the grave is my birth given duty
My race to the grave is my birthright
My inborn malignance manifests failure complete
I know I'll never leave this shitball alive
My insurrection versus resurrection let's me know
This name dies with me
This depravity this futility
It's synonymous with family
Fuck you forever and fuck me
I deny both idols and hope
I reject this holy hoax
At the end of my noose
Fuck the son long live the beast
There's an itch in my throat only a gun can scratch
Enraptured by the glow of armageddon of which you already know
The black void twists and turns and calls me home
A vendetta for revenge and bloodlust to die
To watch it all come to an end preaching sermons of sleaze
My advice Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death
Who would call this shitball home
Who wouldn't be best served
By feasting at the funeral knell
Who hungers not for decay
My advice Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death
The preaching of psalms denied
Extinguish the light it shines no more
Of servitude and supplication
Bring on nuclear winter
Feast
Drown in silence and servitude
Requiems for the lifeless
Damnation and downfall
The two gifts of life
Feast
Extinguish the light it shines no more
Who hungers not for decay  Bring on nuclear winter
Bring an end to this curse
Torrents of blood cover the eyes of the lost in a discordian blanket
To bury the illusions of those not silenced from slit throats
Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed
The power of mercy is now extinct
Blackgloved hands knives to throats
These are the new messiahs
Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed
Putrid breath of life how I hate you
You burn all you touch with gifts dual
Of misery and awakening
A rotting sentence that walks and kneels
All that prays kneels and dies
Arms outstretched on bended knee
All that walks kneels prays and dies
Tongues of ice tongues of fire
All shall burn in the funeral pyre
Arms outstretched pray and die
We exhalt
Annihilation we are your guides let us be your eyes
Let us hold hands united in the great uncoming
Of that which is perfect
We bow great bringer of night
Choronzon's dawn we embrace you
Offer forth the benevolent
Tentacle of futility
Whispers of obliteration echoing nigh
Bring down the summer of finality
We huff your rot now come forth
And carry us home
Bear benevolent gifts of decimation
Our congregation of the end
Welcomes you
Forever and never of ways
And impossible
Great breaker of worlds
To thee great king
Let us be your vessels
For the great uncoming
Always and impossible
Great destroyer of life
We huff your rot
The tragedy of the excommunicated
Forever and ever always impossible
Soliloquies written in blood
As we were all born so shall
we die alone
Baptised in scars crowned in agony
Conceived with the futile notion of the self
could ever ascend
A swine existence for this plague of mortals most foul
Rip the skies asunder to draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
Shower mortals with the remains of their kin
There is nothing left worth saving
And even less worth dying for
The ultimate blessing is silent sleep
Forever as it was once foretold
Rip the skies asunder and draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
Dog eats dog eats man eats self
The packing order of the leprous
Fundaments of failure embodied in man
Begotten signs of faith drop lifeless
Under the velvet of no promised tomorrow
A swine existence for his plague of mortals most foul
Rip the skies asunder draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
O great lord shower us with shit and piss
O great lord give meaning to this outrage
O great lord bear the vestige of the atom
O great lord in glory Annihilus
O great lord let me consume your suffering
O great lord let me waft the fumes of your corpse
O great lord I inhale your pestilence
O great lord shower us with your death
O great lord
We are all but blood on Satan's claws
Rain down plague to wash down famine
Bathe us in the waters of death
Shower us with fire eternal
The cleansing when all became none
Congregate flagellate
We the downtroden beg you
Correct this most grave of mistakes creation
We who exhalt in the end worship it
We beg for baptism in blood in sinew
Snuff us out
Burden us not with the disease of tomorrow
Wrap us instead with black wings of sorrow
No prayers sent up to an empty sky
Sink for fangs deeper into our necks
We who exhalt in the end worship it
Baptise us all with blood
Baptise us with humanity's eulogy
The end when all became none
If the streets are sewers the churches are abbatoirs
In case of rapture the car might be unmanned
But the gun tower won't be
Send us back to the vapor of the ether
Rain down plague
When all became nonewe were born without eyes 
and the sockets were just break proof safes 
read these books and diaries 
that's how they said we could start clean 
but I would rather staple my own hands to a train 
then pray on knees that judge and blame
If I could better myself I swear I would
I swear to god I'd fucking change myself 
but the five billion hands of the world are pulling me down
My veins are turning a dark blue
I feel like dying how about you
Take the coins out from under your tongue
unsew the pockets because I am holding on to nothing
Drown drown I'd fucking drown without you
If I said you were the only one
who could pull me out of this one
would you think it was fiction
I don't remember the good ones from the bad 
But it's too late because 
I can't hold back from the bucket of bruises
Brothers and sisters our lease is way expired now 
Drink the youth
Drink the youth
The stomach holds heavy circulations 
Our scariest secrets and pleasures
Fuck us front to back
Save our teeth and maybe our copies won't melt under the light
We could build a city in a single day 
but in a couple of seconds we would try 
to bury our regrets
They don't make caskets like they used to with escape buttons 
So grab my chest and slip your fingers
through my ribs hold on to this blood machine inside
because its all about to end
They said we might not come back from this one
but who fuckin' cares
at least it will make us into humans
Shape my legs until they walk on order
shape my eyes so they wont tear up on command
shape this heart and make it harder than forever 
but remind me never to stick my hand out the window 
because its worth more than your breath
So what if your teeth hold a grudge
so what if your grinning means nothing 
I bit my own hand clearly right off
I can't keep my mouth busy I can't back up my spit 
The cursed no one can change us
The spells no one can take us 
I'm tired of your breaking downs
keep us away from your maybes and your killing downs
The heavies hearts can keep from breaking down
churning grinding itself into slumber
A plague on both your plans
but it's too bad that the prettiest smiles can taste so awful
Burn the quakers 
learn
don't catch fire
burn
now can you make some pictures with your fingers
What's that father father
It wasn't gravity it was the witches
Make your fingers into pillars 
hold all the stomachs in this town 
they can't stomach anymore 
The wood on these trees smell like skin now 
and old fires are full of carpenter stories
where they push plastic nails through their smiles 
It wasn't gravity it was the witches 
Just wait till they cook up a cure for ignorance
The last time we spoke we ended up no where
and it seems like my words
aren't any better than your quotes 
our speeches were reversed
just like the movements of our hands 
with every sentence I became more afraid
I remember every sentence and I remember every word
because through this mirror
I thought my words would come out backwards
and your mouth is just a reflection of what I can't swallowRealms above us
Leave behind us
Onward
The end is near
Unholy seer
Consuming sin
Shedding skin
No hope
Total fear
Consuming sin
Throne of fire
Dormant tyrant
Sleeping giant
Majestic
Uprising
Flames and arrows 100 000 descending flies
To carrion
No hope
Total fear
Consuming sin
Throne of fire
Iron chariot
Hallowed machine
Bring us to the zone
Flawless victory
Ridden endlessly
Charging alchemy
Rotten potency
Dying majesty
Flawless victory
Relentless equestrian
Majestic hammer
Arrow piercing
Onwards aggressor
Deadly progress
Rotten potency
Dying majesty
Flawless victory
Relentless equestrian
Majestic hammer
Hold aloft the book of deadly quests
Select the path of least resistance
Mystic powers of the wilderness
Raining down upon the evilness
Reign of fire from a hand of steel
With deadly bow and fleet of heel
Axe like a hammer crushing foes
Armoured hide and shield deflecting blows
To the quest a team of four are bound
Deadly hordes of rotten death are found
All swept aside with deadly force
No hesitation no remorse
YOU'RE NEXT
Endless age so desolate
Kingless realm so desperate
Throneless rule of nothing
Blade cracked in defeat
This is nothing
Realm of nothing
We are all nothing
You are nothing
All this is infinite
We rot inside of it
Arise to bleakest vista
All suffer here
what cannot kill us
what will not save us
Crawl to a dead conclusion
Unending Failure
Grasp onto emptiness
The land of dead hope
All this is infinite
We rot inside of it
Retreating up the mountain
Chaos steed in flight
Every man is seething
Destruction in their sight
Never dies the victor
Glory blade is forged
Anxiously awaiting
Hidden finality
The path of Nevermore
Turning and unknowing
All we're fighting for
Black shapeless warriorBefore me sits my image of dreams
Solitary alone and brazen
Not half a mind
Brought before me unto me
Mocking idolatry
The light of your lies
Waiting to fade
The light of your lies
Soon you shall fade
The light of your lies
I will you to fade
The light of your lies
Yes you will fade
Shattered like the pieces of Godly divine
Solitary alone and empty
One with my mind
The once was has gone back beyond
Mocking me no more
Scream for your soul
What have you done
Pray to your God
You burning inside
What have you done
Pray to your God
The light of your lies
Waiting to fade
The light of your lies
Soon you shall fade
The light of your lies
I will you to fade
The light of your lies
Yes you will fade
Forgive me a twist of mind gone too far
Empty alone and solitary
Nothing left inside
I cry for you yes up unto you
My sweet lost love
Scream for your soul
What have you done
Pray to your God
You burning inside
What have you done
Pray to your God
I know my path is there somewhere
My destiny is there somewhere
I wish to be
I wish to be
I wish to be
I wish to be
I know my path is there somewhere
My destiny is there somewhere
Laid out before in my lost time
These encroaching thoughts create my hell
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Regretting each day that I do wake
My endless circle spins my fate
Visions of life they scream out loud
Visions of life to be broke down
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Nightmares of our creation
Enter imagination
Binding ties of twisted innocence
Looking into spheres of pale blue skies
Tasting flame and acrid smoke
Melting mountains with the soul embrace
Empty and bleeding
The dark shadows behind your wall
Want you to be mine
Bleeding veins invoking ecstasy
Looking into the pale blue skies
Melting mountains with the soul embrace
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me
The dark shines in your arms
The shadows melt in your arms
Light breathes no escape
Melting mountains with the soul embrace
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The voice of mine is imagination
Empty and bleeding
Waiting to feed
The light in your eyes shines for me
Binding the ties of life
If you could see the pale blues skies
Enter imagination
Release with syncopation
Want you to be mine
Want you to be mine
This vision in my head
Of you won't let go
I try to cleanse my eyes
Why can't I just let go
I feel the heat below
It's tearing at my soul
I am the one you feel
I will make you see
Your desires are mine
Yes I can make you bleed
Why can't you just let go
Open your world to me
Slither into the unknown
None of our reasons are clear
Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Embrace the burning pyre
Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Devour the burning pyre
It's calling out to me
I see the darkness spread
Fruition of the time
This vision in my head
Oh no I can't let go
An open world to me
Held tight between the folds
None of our reasons are clear
Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Embrace the burning pyre
Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Devour the burning pyre
Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Embrace the burning pyre
Release the thoughts inside
The darkness that you know
Devour the burning pyre
I'm facing the dark
And I wonder why
Why the light
Has allowed solidity
Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us you know
I think I'm falling down
Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us you know
I think I'm falling down
Every day another strain
And we're falling from the sky
We weaken ourselves
They decree our truth
Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us you know
I think I'm falling down
Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us I know
I think I'm falling down
Giving all that you're told
Another mindless wasted thought
Biting hands that do feed
We summon our fate
Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us you know
I think I'm falling down
Look at me can't you see
I think I'm falling down
The world around us I know
I think I'm falling down
I have no doubt that you are blind
Walk a holy path broken from inside
Gracious creatures flail tearing at flesh
Traces of life are broken from inside
We sing a lonely song
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
See life slip out
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
Righteous wisdom we trip on false words
Pious sanctity broken from inside
Endless hours of psychobabble
Walking straight lines follow narrow path
Now the day has come to wake from your sleep
Twisting writhing no power left inside
We sing a lonely song
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
See life slip out
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
Gracious creatures flail tearing at flesh
Traces of life are broken from inside
Endless hours of psychobabble
Walking straight lines follow narrow path
We sing a lonely song
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
See life slip out
Fall to your knees
Fall to the ground
Sitting on my throne
Reality in life my devil
Surrounded by myself
They are pulling me under
Caressing the invalids
Here I sit and I wait
Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows falling off the edge
Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows falling off the edge
Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows falling off the edge
Buried with myself
I bleed while smiling
The empty eyes that stare
Broken again and again and again
Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows falling off the edge
Small fires of life
Oh the swirl grows falling off the edge
Spinning a web of deceit
Chasing a never ending circle
A world never born to you
Your personal tainted birth
Release thyself
Devoid of light
Carry on to the end
Forever rid of life
What has become
A twisted world of hate
An evil befallen into the innocent
What has become
A twisted world of hate
An evil befallen into the innocent
Swimming in tears of pain
A voice lost to all
Release thyself
Devoid of light
Carry on to the end
Forever rid of life
What has become
A twisted world of hate
An evil befallen into the innocent
What has become
A twisted world of hate
An evil befallen into the innocent
Deaf to the ears of life
Death well deserved
Release thyself
Devoid of light
Carry on to the end
Forever rid of life
I'm a wheel I'm a wheel
I can roll I can feel
And you can't stop me turning
Cause I'm the sun I'm the sun
I can move I can run
But you'll never stop me burning
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the day I'm the day
I can show you the way
And look I'm right beside you
I'm the night I'm the night
I'm the dark and the light
With eyes that see inside you
Come down with fire
Lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the man on the silver mountain
Come down with fire
And lift my spirit higher
Someone's screaming my name
Come and make me holy again
Well I can help you you know I can
I'm the man on the silver mountain
I'm the man on the silver mountain
Just look at me and listen
I'm the man the man give you my hand
I'm the man on the silver mountain
Come down with fire
And lift your spirit higher
I'm the man on the mountain
The man on the silver mountain
I'm the night the light
The black and the white
The man on the silver mountain
Through the history we've had
Countless fights and wars
Cultures have passed for no reason why
Among the animals we see
A fight for life and death
Only the strongest will survive
I won't take this for a law of mother nature
I don't belive in a world of violence
We're building a force
Making a false feel of safety
We're building a force
Threatening our basis to be
We're using our technology
To make the greatest bomb
Believe there will still be a future
To the extreme at the worst
It will lead to ruin
Our civilization will end for good     
I won't take this for a way of living in peace
I don't believe that the weapons secure
We're building a force
The sun goes down
Darkness falls
Will we ever
See a new day
We're building the force 
Out from the dark
To the freedom
No more retreat
Cancellation
Marching towards
Fiery Landscape
Leaving behind
Smoky waste land
Killing for your rights
Regaining the sanity
Blinded existens
Stigmatizing your own faith
War of hate
See the evil
Reach up for you
Endless seaching
For a new way
Watch them dying
Slowly men fal
Hear the crying
A helpless call
Killing for your rights
I'm gazing at the sky
It's time to wonder why
Our olbiteration
An existed cry
So when I'm thinking back
Before the last attack
Why did we end it all
In a fatal fall
Killing for your rights
Tears falling from the sky
Cold winds make the fade leaves fly
Sadness and sorrow is filling the air
Crying for you 'cause you're no longer here
Tears
You have spread your wings
And flown far away
Only present is grief
I'm bowed down with sorrow
Grief more than i can bear
Hope turning in despair
Bowed down with sorrow I'm bowed down in vain
Thre's no one here who can ease my pain
Grief
You have spread your wings
Pain and suffer all I see
Misery is blinding me
Time will come when I will follow
But so long I'll mourn for you
You have spread your wings
Deep in the woods you can hear her
Singing songs so enticing
The prettiest tunes that you've ever heard
Taken you'll follow the way
Where the voices are guiding
Far from the path she's waiting for you
Alone by the mere she is dancing
In the wind her long hair's flicking
She's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen
Obsessed by desire you're blinded
When you're standing right before her
She's looking deep into your eyes as she says
Fall in my arms let me be yours
I'll give you everything you're dreaming of
Come dance with me say you'll be mine
We'll be in heaven till the end of time
Seduced you will fall in her arms
Tight you hold her next to you
There's nothing in this world that can stop you now
But suddenly you see reflections
Of her body in the water
Rotten and old with a cow's tail she has fooled you
Realize she is an evil
Wicked fairy who has trapped you
Caught in her net so helpless and lost
She's casting a spell on you
And you'll be among her big castle
You are turned into a cow 'cause you did what she said
Fall in my arms
Still we can hear her
Calling for us
Still she is singing
Her seducing tunes
Fall in my arms
Feeling scared don't know why
Everyone are staring
I want to get out of here
Dropping out wanna shout
In despair I'm fighting
I'm living in a world filled with fear
It's in my mind won't go away
Just like an obsession
Who are you my guest
Falling down to the abyss
Feels like I'm dreaming
But this is real I can't escape
Secrets unknown wiil be revealed
I thought that all was lost
secrets unknown will be revealed
Lokking into another world
Intuition telling me
Look into the future
My hope is growing strong
Horrorstruck go away
I can't see the daylight
The time is running away from me
Gonna be be your friend
If you wanna let me
I'm standing by a crossroad
Here I am take me now
Into your arms I'll fall
I feel secure hiding in you
Secrets unknown will be revealed
Darkness around you
Despair surrounds
The remaining parts of your mind
Pain growing strogner
Can't take it no longer
It's tearing your soul apart
Secrets unknown will be revealed
I thought that all was lost
Secrets unknown will be revealed
I will survivem I'm gonna live
Looking into another another
Another world
Wave after wave is breaking on the shore
Keeping the secrets of destiny
The sun goes down
I'm trembling with wrath and awe
Am I worthy such a sight
Who I worthy such a sight
Who am I to feel joy
In lack of insight
In greed for more
Conclusions slipped my mind
The distant light is slowly fading away
Time after time
The signs have been so clear
Now there's no time for recovery
I feel a chill
I'm clutching at a clue
But the failure is a fact
Who'll save me from the night
You'll remain
You'll turn on
A solitary life
Left behind on my bare rockface I'll watch
The Last Sunset
You will remain
Always be there
I have passed the point of no return
Long time ago
If there is a god above
Powers who have always known
Give me a reason
Am I all alone to blame
Was I meant to strive in vain
Answer my cry
You will remain
Always be there
I have passed the point of no return
long time ago
Lights fade away
The Last Sunset
Time has com turn around
See another day
You have to find your way
Look behind see the past
Enormous decay
A gloomy sight in grey
All the years past away
In such misery
Now it's time to be free
People cried people died
For the anarchy
Their closed eyes could not see
No more oppression
You will fight to be free
Stop the fraud erode strangers
You live to survive
No regrets are to come
Future is to be
A short straw ends in hell
Utilize what you know
Like a hallowed spell
Decide whare you will dwell
Remember the hard times
No ingratitude
To recede is to lose
No time for probation
No time retreat
Go for the final beat
No more oppression
End all the fear
Won't face a new disaster
End all the fear
Obtain a place to grow old
End all the fear
A winner and creator
End all the fear
You will live to see the light
No more oppression
A new victim
Another foe
Soldiers pitch for the guns of believers
A battlegound
A fight for god
One more dying and the peace will be near
You face the sky
Before you die
This war will be a fight for the sacred
Too late to cry
Too late ty try
Bear the burden a staring hallowed eye
Stop realize
What's going on
A holy war
Stop face it now
You cannot win
A holy war
Among the gods
You're marching blindly to the certain death
Don't bow down rise your head
Conceiling power hallowed by thy name
I live you die in shame
Stop realize
Is this the freedom
Or an absurd world
Final solution
Severe rules of life
Nothing to die for
No reason to live
Just pay off your bill
A creators will
Conceived in Abyssal Regions
Enormous bestial figures populate the landscape
Breeding in pitch darkness
Genus endemic to the catacombs of the underworld
utterly void of sensation
asexual process of autoreplication
spawns voracious organisms of heterogeneous forms
isogenic edentulous creatures secrete
gaseous exotoxins vaporizing and absorbing
through glandular osmosis
sustaining a sinuous structure beyond evolutionary perfection
roaming as gaunt shadows
osteoids develop mimetic ambient configurations
concealed amongst the cavernous substructure
feeding in throngs
variants subsist on discarded remnants of
the seldom edible waste of demonic skin
primeval phantoms of the nether world feast upon
rougue underlings those of little command
unrivaled by lesser abominations
nevertheless the darkening engergy looms
forshadowing numerous broods
still many shall hence forth remain unvanquished
In this hidden world of damnation
The crevasse of sacrilege in which the simonists remain
observe this perversion of baptism
mockery of a sacred blessing 
with sacraments of infernal pain
stretching over this desolate field
millions lay buried in darkness
sinners thrust head first into the fissures of infinite induction
quivering shakingprotruding limbs searing
blessed of the fire and oil
overwhelming torture drawn beyond the unknown
Baptismal incineration upon simonists
reconcilement of impenitence
pastors of holy faith placed in high ranks
praised in gods name
prophets inserting fear of false prophecies
manipulation of holy power bestowed
to fulfill a covetous desire
high priests and bishops doomed to decay
as inmates of this evil land for all eternity
Torn between realities
Denounced from the heavens 
cast down unto the minions
Amongst entities of pendulous condition
Virulently inspecting
assimilating the body through abstract refinements
unwillingly subjected vivisected
afflicted beyond the boundaries of suffering
grotesque manipulation of physical form
stochastically modifying
carnally absolved of humanity a spiritual cleansing
this vessels design is restructured
continually deformed
contorted to anomalous states
bodily manifestation of sin
rid of the imperfections of earthly flesh
torment hath not a flaw
Catharsis of human impurity
afflicted beyond the boundaries of suffering
manipulation of physical form stochastically modifying
carnally absolved of humanity a spiritual cleansing
Such is the will of the ungodly
amongst the monastery exists no salvation
no faith preserved nor absolute atonement
forevermore shall these souls reside
for here remain those exiled from gods divine grace
Unto the depths of the seventh circle
lie pathless woods of dismal beings
of blackened leaves and misshapen trees
diseased in poisonous thorns
infested with creatures that feed on the innards
morbidly bleeding profusely excreting
lamenting in pain and suffering intensely
behold the trees bear the faces of tortured souls
imprisoned for eternity
embodied in elms of eternal misery
denied bodily form and sentenced to captivity
embodied in elms of eternal misery
atrocious self sacrifice occludes the pristine light of paradise
deprived of bodies
souls ripped from them and thrown below to the underworld
to claim their forsaken embodiment of wood and gore
branching arms reach forth broken and torn
spewing blood from various open sores
ravaged by beasts
feeding on their anatomy
punishing self ridden greed
embodied in elms of eternal misery
denied bodily form and sentenced to captivity
embodied in elms of eternal misery
Scores of enfeebled souls through the abyss descend
angels of the lord skin the color of ash
scourged from heaven
Perpetually plummeting into the blackness of the deepest chasms
never again to return to light
in droves they grovel
obsequiously kneeling at the throne 
subjugated by temptation
enticed by boundless supremacy
ignominious pupils of divinity adorned with
crowns in adoration of sacrilege most high
endowed with immeasurable power
the choir of anguish begin recitation of decrees
unholy proclamations strike the air
summoning the onset of their sovereignty over
the kingdom of eternal darkness
realms of the ungodly
the dominion from which no human soul has ever won salvation
held forth
saturating the forgotten recesses of every passage
piercing sound beyond sound
pervading the very blinking of an eye to the 
infinitesimal turning of the slowest spheres
it begins the second death of souls
Swept amongst ruinous cyclones
thrust into the hurtling smog of indecency
a whirling gust of molestation
lust and betrayal
wings are born upon these shadowed souls
their chants and sorrows can be heard
uttering lamentations
moans and blasphemies divined 
forged within lecherous offerings
these souls traverse upon the sky tearing through the astral stratum restless with fury
drawing immensity from the abounding souls 
impenetrable devastating intensity
mangles constantly the obscured mass
the external form engulfed entirely
in the veil of tribulation
stretching an endless formation
ominously coiling
a spiraling cloud of resounding anguish
destructive cyclonic force of infernal rage 
crippling creatures of sordid deeds
these carnal sinners are tormented 
by reason of desire
A new era dawns in the hour of ruin
the collapse of empires
The eclipse of civilization
A bitter wind sweeps the spectral remains of 
a barren world
from the ashen debris emerges a shapeless entity
the anointed one
cloaked in garments unearthly a nebulous aura
the symbolic figure
amorphous in semblance demigod in flesh
an arrogant being of magnificent countenance
temples of false council erected in praise
seeding the contrivance of this upheaval
the esoteric conception of 
the divine order of Babylon
serving the monarchy through magistrates
pawns of the priestcraft
appointed as conduits to the almighty
implementing admonitory rituals
viciously inculcating the apocryphal parable
suffusing the paradigm
manipulating belief through fear
the shepherd and flock are one
Ruined souls of unspeakable sin
long exempt from every punishment
as they transcend mortality these misbegotten
souls begin mutation
metaphysically transformed
entering monomorphic state
Grafted compressed and corrupted
unified in suffering
manipulated for servitude
melded within pillars shaped from mortal clay
amongst ageless clusters of great towers
eternal despair blind the wretched within 
the very walls of their treachery 
crudely affixed are the countless insignificant 
creatures within these colossal structures
for in the absence of god the fallen shall bear the immeasurable weight of transgression
no dark prophecy could fortress the dismal fate
suspended in a permanent state of affliction
dark visions of ancient evil manifest within
the distorted mind of these stagnated souls
time is meaningless
torment is everlasting
suffering begets itself eternally eternally
Walk forth into the rivers of red 
through blood that boils the soul 
he who hath sinned shall lay in the bed
of this scorching sanguineous stream
set into a blaze of burning misery
submerged in the searing blood they cause to flow
for they themselves were once enforcers of human cruelty
the sacrifice of mortal life remains unforgiven enkindled fingers frail and blackened
reach forth beseechingly 
black plumes rise smoke envelopes for the merciless wraith to endure
screams erupt like choirs in an off key hymn
a deafening cacophony of sonorous din
Perceived in the distance carried in the wind
frenzied embittered hands smother these
desperately grasping the threshold to the shores 
Hysteria takes hold
nameless crowds become enmeshed
wallowing in the crimson swamp
the waters pulsate violently
churning and frothing fiery liquid
savage beasts await pesertion
circling along the banks 
ferociously piercing all who should seek
release from their perennial agony 
once more plunged beneath the boiling surface
into the chaos below
burn fallen images of tyranny scourges of god
kings of bloodshed and despoilmentWhat can I say
You're so worth it to me
It's me I hate cause I can't commit
Why why can't I commit to the things that mean so much to me
Just want to stray but stay the same
Need to find a way to not lose or gain anything
Anything
I'm never sure about this Times like this
And I know I can't deal with the pressure
I can't commit
No
So many ways to change but that all will stay the same
Still I can't still I won't
Let me save you
I want this so bad
I want you so bad
I want this so bad
You wield a sword to this life now take a stab at what you want
When are things ever meant to be 
These days that we love 
Will end up being the days that we hate 
I found meaning 
And I for one refuse to give up 
And I refuse 
To discontinue my direction 
There's more to life there's more to love 
There's more to it all 
There was something more 
The nights we stayed up late 
The days were light head shine 
Memories made habits 
Come alive Come alive 
No endeavors no no's and nevers 
Go 
I won't forget 
But I'll push on 
You're full of fear but so was I 
I've given my all too many times 
I guess I'm to blame 
I won't sleep tonight 
No 
Take me for nothing more but safety 
Take me for anything but never break me 
I never needed you to trust me 
But just to know I trust myself 
I worried about the future in the eyes of no one else
But myself see lessFor all those born to serve
And those that chose to hide
how many worker bees died within our hive
Let their sadness be our blessing
Let their losses
Lead the way
The dark horse will one day come
To free the light from all of us
One day the dark horse will come
For all those born to die
And those that lost the fight
how many fallen friends died within our sights
Let their hard roads be our way out
Let their passion lead the way
The dark horse will one day come
To free the light from all of us
One day the dark horse will come
No matter the man or the machine
Beasts will become what
They were meant to be
In the name of lovers in the name of wars
We'll show the demons for what they are
Dark horse ride
Towards the light
Dark horse ride onward
Towards to light
Onward
My barren plan to be a better man
Rots in abandoned fields
These idle hands inherit spoiled lands
As the hungry become the pigs
We reap and we sow
We mourn who we were
Love what we lost
In the grave of youth
Laying with lions to hide my grief
From the beast that never sleeps
Our tired hearts tear us apart
Searching for the key
Reap what we sow
Waiting for the axe to fall
Sun is sinking clouds collecting
I'm in a race to stop the bleeding me
My will is leaving darkness falling
Need to finally cut me from you
I need to learn to love me
I need to stop this suicide machine
I need to learn to love me
I need to stop this destruction
I need to learn to love me
Rotting legacies
Fading loyalties
Effigies for the beasts
Effigies
Distorted hearts
Worship God currency
That is so worthless to me
The poor eat the poor
Just like we've done before
Cursed by the burden youth brings
Effigies for the beasts
Effigies you and me
For you and me
Saw you coming around my bend
Cutting teeth and breaking bread
Making moves and smearing friends
Your karma has been racking debts
Left your throne in foreclosed homes
Claimed that crown of decay
Built castle walls with blood and bone
To shield your soul from wither and decay
Worms will feed
Saw you slither around their necks
Sinking teeth into their flesh
Spitting venom seeing red
You will fall where you lay your head
Rats will feast
The worms will find a way
The rats will find a way
The collapsing veins are empty
The stars are less bright tonight
The future is moving farther away
From defeated eyes
Your words can't touch me
While your past weighs down your life
Your heart can't love me
While your past still haunts you inside
The past still hunts you
The past still follows you
You  all I had I gave to you
We are echoes in the well
Shut your doors their storm is coming
Of unlived dreams that were cast away
Hear the howls soaring in the wind
Don't let our end begin
My hatred grows as their tears fall
Shield innocence from hungry tombs
Keep damages from taking you
Hear the howls soaring in the wind
Don't let our end begin
My hatred grows as their tears fall
I'll do anything that I can do
To lock the windows beasts are climbing through
My hatred grows as their tears fall
Extinguish our own hells
A triumph of tragedy
And all it claims from me
As those years recede
While lies are all I see
Missed steps and misgivings
Driven by frailty
What you call family
Feels so dead to me
Nothing left to lose
When I'm losing you
Losing the battle
And losing the war
Pick your poison as dead beats do
Leave a wake in the hearts that hurt you
Pick your poison as dead beats do
Blood pulsing through your wounds
A thousand warnings are ringing true
Burning their homes writing in stone
The name of demons inside of you
You left your mark on this world
You left your scar on this world
You left your scar
You left your mark
Wound them
Severed my roots of dead family trees
Finding the damage inside of me
Parting blood red seas on bended knee
Too much to ask when it's so hard to breathe
No way out
Tearing my soul to finally see
The real wreckage between you and me
A cold grin for these  door
My haywire heart your product of war
No way out
Cutting myself for clarity
Jest keep falling
No way out cutter
Cutting myself for clarity
I just keep falling into darkness
Cutting myself for clarity
Just keep falling
One way down
No way out
No longer feel you no longer fear you
I've worked overtime in your cancer factories
Lived with those lies to make those loose ends meet
I've taken all my chances
And still I'm missing steps
Another losing battle
For those left for dead
I've fed their rabid feast
Yet still pick from my own bones
I've ripped out my own heart
Trying to keep you whole
I've lived like true angels
I've only learned to fall
I've sold myself to death
For nothing at all
No longer feel anyone
No longer fear anything
I've hung my sorrow on your promised apologies
I've left the nest
With broken/battered wings
The blood in my eyes has taught me to defeat
The beasts at the feet of saint obscurity
No longer feel
No longer fear
Voracious children and wolves
Sharpen their teeth on our bones
Carrion feeds the wretched
Vacant eyes peer through the hole
Beggars and thieves bring down a common enemy
While pawnshop kings and corner queens
All hawk their souls for gold
Lifelong victims pound and claw at the ground
Searching for a way out of their skin
Writhe in the cruel bloom
Trying so hard to find beauty in flesh torn from me
Trying so hard not to lose you
In cobwebs and empty hearts
Lifelong victims pound and claw at the ground
Searching for a way out of their skin
Writhe in the cruel bloom
Witness the ghostlike shades of ourselves
Searching for any way out of our skin
Writhe in the cruel bloom
Down by your side I watch the dreary light
It illuminates your sleeping skin
I reach my cold arms across the bed
You make no move
You never do
Own these dire nights
Own their seething lies
Own my damage own my scars
They paint a broken life's shattered art
And time won't turn my wretched world
To stand in your shadow is to be homeFacemask of a human icon

Make something useful like Orwell's head

Thanks to science now there are no radar men on mars

Robots could be serving food and running everything
Instead we have an extra sheep
Lets all begin to sing

oh my Cadillac
i eat asphalt from my hands with the corpse in the trunk
sunglasses trendy shirt latest model chain saw
i see cut up corpses on colored roller blades
running on the sidewalk
eating creamy ice cream 
they greet me smiling
not knowing that they're only
other right hands for my collection
Beverly hills corpse 
a beautiful place for a relaxing vacation
gorgeous and smiling young people
dreaming about becoming famous

i remember when we listened to Carcass
looking at mutilated corpses in the pathologist's room
we still have good hearing
and we can't forget
how beautiful it was 
to paint with that models' blood
sew up the wounds
and don't spill all this blood
otherwise you'll get my carpet dirty 
and it won't be a good thing for you
my feet are the only means to play the drum kick
therefor i have to play grind
hoping that my carpet will stay clean
load the spoons and shot when i say so

the tooth brush thinks it has killed the soap bar
but it has too many bristles over it's head
and forgot that one can slip on soap
suddenly many soap bubbles come out of the sink
that wasn't the end of the soap bar
the battle went on for a few more minutes
then they realized that fighting wasn't so important
and each one went back to Finnish their own tasks
the tooth brush went back to brushing teeth
the soap bar continued to get used
and the world keep going as usual

I came to the old house in the dark night
I felt only a dark sensation but no fright
The strange old man's words ran through my mind
In this unholy place what would I find
I entered the mansion thinking I was alone
I saw a strange ancient gravestone
Suddenly a woman's voice whispered my name
Or was the old man playing a silly game
Aleidis came to me unimaginably beautiful
Dressed in white while the moon was full
Suddenly I felt overcome by an unholy desire
But was she just young or an ages old vampire
Maybe she was just a portrait or a figment of my sick mind
But whatever the truth she was the best wife I'd ever find
I loved her in a way I had never even known
But would the blood my love needed soon be my own
She used to kill animals and suck their blood
She belonged to Satan her soul lost by God
One day at last she made my neck her unholy teeth feel
Now we are joined for eternity but is this all real
Mountains engulfed by darkness
Campfires blazing in the night
Ten thousand warriors gathered
The fires their only light
Now let the sacrificial blood flow
To appease the war gods
A great battle is at hand
We must fight against the odds
The enemy awaits us
Ahead lies victory or death
Steel cuts through flesh
Breathe your last breath
Blood flows everywhere
The woods are turning red
Spears fly and hammers clash
My sword severs your head
Force of life and omen of death
Blood colours my sword red
We find glory on this battlefield
Where so many fought and bled
Once every man must die
If not by the spear by old age
Worthy are only honour and pride
So on the battlefield I rage
Blasting through the blackened sky
Knowing not but knowing still
Lost all sense of place and time
Yet filled with an evil thrill
Awakening in the black cathedral
Departing the dimensional gates
No need for any explanation
Knowing the task that awaits
Full moon shines in utter darkness
The hour of midnight drawing near
Tonight 13 the bells will chime
Tonight the holy tremble in fear
Behold the 7 innocent maidens
Behold the 7 velvet altars
Behold the 7 southern crosses
Behold
Behold the 7 evil priests
Behold the 7 silver chalices
Behold the 7 silver daggers
Behold
Sacrifices have been made thunder and lightning appear
Rejoice in hideous blasphemy know that the time is near
The chosen hail the Master well lusting for hate and scorn
Crying out in evil ecstasy the Antichrist is born
Straying through the dark forest
The night so black the mist so cold
A lonely path to destiny
Feel Evil's desperate hold
Feel the presence of the wolf
As the hunter roams the silent woods
A fire burns close yet so far away
Men they dance in robes and hoods
And the wolf cries evil
The wolf cries evil
A thick blanket of fog covers all
Feel the darkness all around
Breathe the evil be the darkness
Forever and ever and ever Hellbound
Become one with all darkness and evil
Join the pack howl in the night
Hail the Master for all eternity
No more fear no more fright
And the wolf cries evil
The wolf cries evil
Tread the Path of Destiny
Walk under the Sign
Guided by the light of Set
Will ever the moon shine
Eternal desert lies ahead
The smile of Azazel
Whisper an ancient incantation
Cast an unholy spell
Descend into the darkest chamber
Celebrations of sin
Worship of Evil so much older
Than Prometheus' kin
Weird reality surrounds the chosen
Deep in Midgard's womb
Taste the smell of absurdity
In this infernal tomb
Manifestation on the altar
Pray to eternal truth
Sacrifice through fear and lust
Virgin flesh so smooth
Awake in forest of nowhere
Symphony through the haze
Innocent blood drowning your soul
The skyline is ablaze
Since man has wielded swords
Man has gone to war
Since man acquired speech
He has lied for evermore
Since Abel was struck by Cain
His brother man has slain
Since man has wielded swords
Man has battled for power and fame
Since man acquired fire
He has set the world aflame
Since Eve led Adam to sin
Man's dark desires will always win
Oude toortsen zijn opnieuw ontstoken
Onze ketenen voor altijd gebroken
Niet langer door valse moraal geknecht
Halen wij met vuur en staal ons recht
Bloed vloeit in de sneeuw
Hoort 't gebrul van Ne�rlands leeuw
Ziet de laffe verraders beven
Beter vrij te sterven dan geknecht te leven
De slavenkoning en diens volgelingen
Zullen wij verslaan met magische ringen
Tot Wodan bidden wij andermaal
Onze zielen en zwaarden hard als staal
Door mist en regen wind en kou
Rijden wij trots gelaten zo grauw
Grimmig en o zo vastberaden
Ditmaal kennen wij geen genade
Donar zal ons weer beschermen
Onze vijanden zullen kermen
Onze zwaarden rood van bloed en roest
Nu gebeurt wat gebeuren moest
Het rijk van Jehovah is gevallen
Ziet de lijken van zijn vazallen
Gezuiverd is nu onze geboortegrond
Ziet de nieuwe heidense morgenstondTaught from birth you'll burn in hell
for all eternity
if you don't pledge your soul to Christ
and serve him faithfully
Searching deep within yourself
the evil answer lies
You know your heart is black as hell
and death is in your eyes
Preachers of the holy gospel
evangelist of lies
Blessed are the men in black
who see through the disguise
Blessed are the wicked cursed are the weak
Athian rising tormenting the meek
Our numbers on a constant rise we turn to the attack
We prey upon the old and weak Blessed is the black
They hide behind their book of lies
deceiving without shame
An athian rising fast
to lay waste their claim
Preachers of the holy gospel
evangelist of lies
Blessed are the men in black
who see through the disguise
Searching deep within yourself
the evil answer lies
You know your heart is black as hell
and death is in your eyes
Beyond the walls of ancient tombs
slaves of hell await
Orgies of the dying souls
ascend from hell to reign
Rape the virgin princess
curse her holy Lord
Taint the alter with the blood
of Satan's lifeless whore
6669
Copulation with a corpse
Demons rape her rotting hole
fucked and left to die
Virgin bitch of Christian faith
serves as Satan's slut
Sorcerer of Satan's rule
stalks the night in lust
Seduction of the holy father
Casting Satan's spell
Tortured and then crucified
his soul shall rot in hell
Tormented Christian sons of God
lie cold within their grave
Tortured and then sacrificed
for a God they sought to save
Curse their souls to burn in hell
Satan's wrath unfolds
to conquer and then terminate
damnation takes it's hold
Son of God repent your sins
and pledge your soul to hell
Pray that Satan will forgive
once your God has fell
Expect the death of those who pray
to a God so long since passed
Your God is dead and now you die
Satan rules at last
Burn The Cross
The thoughts within my twisted mind
wreak of death and hate
Your dreams of life in heaven
begin to melt away
The evil of my horrid thoughts
Makes your flesh decay
Your life falls victim to my game
as I rise out of the grave
In the darkest corners of my mind and evil dwells
forever I must lie here and burn within this hell
Eternally enshackled as Satan's evil slave
Once again to claim new souls I rise out of the grave
Your world begins to crumble
As you see my wrath unfold
the fingers of my rotting hand
grasp your weary soul
You become another victim
of this wretched game I play
You see the hell in which I live
as you're pulled into my grave
We rock this church
Rock it inside out
Against the world they teach us
on judgement day we shout
The preacher gives us sermon
The preacher gives us prayer
The preacher gives us heaven
Can't he see that we don't care
Rock this church
They cry for better manners
They tell us be polite
They tell us get our hair cut
Don't they know they are asking for a fight
They tell us it's immoral
They tell us it's a sin
We get all our pleasures
From the trouble that we get in
Rock this curch
His mother a whore his father a horse
Born the result of some freak show
Sworn to avenge this cruel twist of fate
Make a trail of destruction as he goes
Since the day of his birth he's been filled with rage
in a crooked incestuous display
He killed the bitch who was the cause of this
and along with her the others must pay
Pulsating steel protrudes from my thighs
she who spreads is she who dies
Long as my arm and five times as thick
You'll die at the end of my iron dick
Terrifying fear at the sight of this gland
he will rape and kill those who defy
The result of his desire like machine gun fire
tearing them to pieces from the inside
When he slides it in that's when the torture begins
his ugly face the last thing that you'll see
The resulting pain from this mammoth cane
Apparent in her endless dying screams
He stands alone outside the gates of hell
Set free to torment and kill
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
He'll search till the end be glad when you've died
a dealer of death he may make a trade
your life will serve him well
A fury unleashed to destroy all it seeks
Death monger sent straight from hell
He breaks through the door hell's own monger returns
Your soul is damned as your world starts to burn
He stands alone outside the gates of hell
Set free to torment and kill
McDeath
He's fed up with fast food
Out of his mind one mad dude
Grabbed his guns went downtown
Mr McDeath is coming to track Ronald down
Bridge
Now the golden arches are bloodstained red
Ronald is dead took a bullet in the head
Chorus
May I take your order please
NOOOO
Can I help you sir
NOOOO
McDonaldland Massacre
He came inside took a seat
They didn't know he didn't come to eat
Asked for his order got a bullet instead
Ronald can't help Ronald is dead
Repeat Bridge
May I take your order please
NOOOO
Oh my god he's got a gun
McDonaldland Massacre
Assorted Mayhem gunshots semiautomatic screams
Ronald is lying on the floor
The Grimace took a bullet trying to run out the door
Hamburglar's brains all over Mayor McCheese and
he won't let you go even if you say please
Quarter Pounder Big Mac Fillet 'O Fish and fries
it doesn't matter what you order everybody dies
Time it rolls on and on
Time the end for which I long
Life it endlessly tortures me
Another life and end to my misery
In death I will find an everlasting peace
an end to all the pain and agony
Another life awaits me then I am free
Man lives helplessly in the dark
A pawn Chosen to play the part
Life it endlessly tortures me
The doors of death are opening
The depths of hell are beckoning
Another life burnt offerings
Another life fulfill your destiny
In death you'll feel the pain that Satan brings
Another life begins so suffer endlessly
You'll burn in hell for eternity
Brought to life a slave of death
A perfect death machine
Creature of duty my duty is death
Fulfill my masters twisted dream
A homocidal masterpiece genetically insane
Purebred executioner
Prodigal of pain
I'm a creature of duty and my duty is to kill
I'm a creature of duty and my duty is death
I'm a creature of duty and my duty is to kill
I'm a creature of duty and my duty is deathDeath to planet earth 
Human scums infect your mind 
Sodomize the earth and let your hatred be your guide 
There is nothing more to see nothing worthy your beliefs 
Terrorize their world and see their hierarchy fall down 
Cooperate with all Satanic forces of the world 
Death to planet earth 
Blood stained whores 
Beings of our works make dreams reality 
Crush the unpure race of god 
Death to planet earth 
Assault those whores  Fall down on the ground 
Rape their minds 
Death to planet earth
Fire floods devastation murder rape obliteration revolution hate 
Hell heaven collision Beautiful diseases 
You deserve all my praise for I have seen the wornderful ways You erase 
All deaths come as such release 
Kill anything Kill everything 
Any god serves me that serves my beliefs
Deepest cold to ever grace the land of planet earth purest cleansing Hellfire to burn the mark of hell upon man 
Hear my call 
Deepest trace to ever possess minds of man purest noxious water to wipe out hordes and tribes 
Ugliest work of art and violence ever seen by motal men 
Prepare for total soul rape 
Ugliest work of death and horror ever seen by men 
Prepare for total soul rapeWhen they put you to the test
That's meant for you to fail
You've been stukk oh god for ages
Eventually you see the light

You're such a mess oh god you're wasted
Until you straight the flush
You'll be standing next in line
Oh oh oh no no no
You can't take that
They think they can hold us down forever
But no one can beat us out of phase
We live hard creatin' all the terror
The government is shaded by our craze
We take shit from no one
Breakin' free never stop
Livin' rabid in the everland
Oooo we're the kids of the underground
Oh there's a riot in everyone
We're the kids of the underground
And we're loud as we tear 'em down
Oooo we're the kids of the underground
Oh there's a feelin' you can't deny
There's a feeling you can't deny
Cause there's a riot in everyone
They say you should live as you are told to
I say you gotta be strong and make up your own mind
Be yourself not a puppet in their freak show
Cause that's the way you'll end up when they beat you blind
Won't take shit from anyone NO ONE
Never played by the rules
Cause we're the kids of the underground
Our time our ways we're the wasted generation
Our life we pay with our nasty reputation
We will always be living free
Always on top of our misery
To live hard is a luxury
And to die of our prophecy

You're a rotchild
You say you don't love me
Well I don't really care about you
Cause I'm a gun turret bad boy baby
Runnin'high on the fumes
It's like a ship of destruction
Makes me cry out for more
All the friends that I know of and the boys in the crew
Oh oh oh ooh we're all the same in the core
Can you feel it inside
We deliver to ya mind
We're a needle in your eye
It's our way of life
Stikk a needle in your eye
I feel something growing
It's on the tip of my tongue
And I feel how it's coming now
I have to scream out my lungs
The poison runnin'within us
A never ending disease
N'the fusion that binds us got a hold of me oh oh oh ooh
From this I can't break free
I can't stand be in the spotlight
Don't like it I never have
The mirror reflecting the street light
In the gutter that's where I am
Trippin' up and down with chemical enlightenment
Heading high gettin' off some load
To be found in a primal state of brightment wander 'round
Crashin' off the blow
Oh oh gotta high speed tikket
Oh oh on this carousel
Oh oh this is so damn wikked
Oh oh live in heaven n' hell
Is this the chart of my illusion
Or is this just the way to be
Is this the heart of my confusion
Or is this just the tikket to me
The vigour of another won't give me the energy
To feel the lust I don't feel a straight line of evil synergy
Good morning to ya snakebit and to all ya powder kegs of snow
I'm a transparent fish in a barrel I feel the shakes but it doesn't show
I rather don't know anymore
I might be gettin' low
Is this the chart of my illusion
Or is this just the way to be
Is this the heart of my confusion
Or is this just the tikket to me
Is this the way I am supposed to
Fell the things that you sellin' me
Is this delight part of confusion
Or is this just the tikket to me
Got ya share of nuthin' stukk with nuthin'
Your mind idle can't get the sleep
The ground is shakin' and you wanna land fast
You're out of function lyin' flat on the street
Always gotta be the first in 'da line
A play with death to be no 1
Cruzin' with the boys in the trashed part of town
Raise my lust of madness when I'm feelin' down
Drinks are flown'
My heart is blowing'
Another night in another town
Ooh I love the taste of cyanide
Ooh how I love to feel it burn inside
I'm on the hour and I've been there for a long time
But somehow I feel like I'm fading out of line
Hang around in the pit of my lair
I levitate gotta get outta here
I'm born a rebel with 'da neck in the noose
They never tame me can't change what I do
My weak resistance of your flower
Got me infected cause I was to blind to see
Everyone told me but did I listen
No I was sick'n tired of the same reply from thee
You lead the game I followed
You were the bait I swallowed
It's a miracle you walk the earth alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You pass it on like I need it the most
I smelled your rose'n caressed your pelats
Never bothered by the thorns that made me bleed
Cause I longed to feel you so deep inside me
But now I'm stukk with you forever without remedy
You lead the game I followed
You were the bait I swallowed
It's a miracle you walk the earth alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You pass it on like I need it the most
You knew my pain
You lead the game
And I followed yeah I followed
Your lies your play you're all the same to me
It's a miracle you walk the earth alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You pass it on like I need it the most
It's a miracle you walk the earth alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You cut me of like I need it the most
miracle miracle
It's a miracle you walk the earth alone
It's a miracle I stand beside you
miracle miracle
You're like a plague in a wide'n open show
You cut me of like I need it the most
The heat is rising the time is here
The real edification
We're a million dreams and all it's fears
That's the core of this creation
We're coming straight out of hell
We're coming straight out of hell
The bursting of the universe
The noise when worlds collide
We're the eristic prophets in this modern curse
Of time we don't confide
In the midnight hour we rise and come alive
This is the journey of our odyssey
1234
We're coming straight out of hell
We're coming straight out of hell
We're coming straight out of hell
We're coming straight out of hell
If ya caught up where you are
Gotta find your guiding star
To point you back where you belong
Standin' tall n'ya got the style
A turbulent mass you're a walkin'rile
You've rang the bell n'won the prize
Let's make this loud here we are
Back on trakk again
This is the moment I love to feel
Back on trakk my friend
Now it's up to you n'me
On the rack and
When we leave the place to be
Back on trakk again
Back on trakk again
Feel the gain building up the spine
Exeeding input overdrive
You gotta love am I rite
You lead the blind you lead the stream
The current ways are much to lean
You are the captain of the team
There is a story to be told you know
Why don't ya share it with the world
don't wanna change my ways to fit in to your pattern
Becoming a man I don't wanna be
So I could see it coming the nite you made the turn
You tore a part my illusion
The reckless shattering you made my heart burn
Your strength made it to conclusion
There is no tomorrow
In the world that I live
Everything that you said to me I bought it
Everything that you told me you made me feel complete
Everything that you said to me I got it
Everything that you told me you made me feel complete
There's always hard times but I can make it through
Another fiction comes to mind now
A new sun is shining I wonder will it do
And give me all the things I want to have
Maybe there's a tomorrow
In the world that I live
You feed upon my affection and the space of my heart
Now I'm never on the burning somehow I made it through the learning
Let there be another day
There is a tomorrow
In the world that I liveWe're arrived and saved our world
Not with weapons without a war
Hear our voice make your choice
Metal is music and ain't a noise
We don't want your blood
We don't want your flesh
We like horror but don't want to kill you
We ain't assassins we ain't Satan's beasts
We like to play to play for faith
CRAWLER for the glory of Metal
CRAWLER CRAWLER
CRAWLER for the glory of Metal of Metal
We're united to save our world
Not with the weapons without a war
Hear our call destroy the wall

I hear him I don't wanna sleep
If he kills me in my dreams
I'm dead for real
Now I'll lay down to sleep
The master of dreams my soul I'll keep
In the reflections of my mind's eye
Evil will see itself and it shall die
Close your eyes Close your eyes
Close your eyes and let me enter your dream
Close your eyes Close your eyes
Close your eyes and let me enter your dream again

An asteroid went up to the earth
It's so fast that it won't be too late
to destroy and for us it will be the end
There are some scared people that run away
In their mind the thought is the same
Stop the march of the great stone and save their lives
BURST all around me BURST and around me
BURST all around me BURST
BURST all around me BURST and around me
BURST destruction and pain
Oh no my eyes
Oh no what they see
I should like be blind
For don't see this dark sky and
day after day my world decay
Bombs and rockets have not brought it down
The sky is covered by dark giant cloud
The cities are desolated and went up in flames
Without the sunlight for more than a year
The frost has shrouded the lands and the tears
that I'm crying frozen with my heart
BURST all around me BURST and around me
BURST all around me BURST
BURST all around me BURST and around me
BURST destruction and pain
Don't be sad for me
I've found the peace that I was looking for
Don't be sad for me
I'm free to hunt but I can't shoot at the birds
Don't be sad for me
I spend my time laughing till one cries
Don't be sad for me
Live your life then there's the Paradise
I've dreamt or I've seen a starlet in the sky 
I've seen a starlet risin' in the night
I've dreamt or I've seen an angel in the sky 
I've seen an angel reachin' Paradise
Don't be sad for me
I run as fast as train on infinite roads 
Don't be sad for me
I can swim like fish against the flow
Don't be sad for me
I lost my dad but now we're together again
Don't be sad for me
Live your life then there's the Paradise
I've dreamt or I've seen a starlet in the sky 
I've seen a starlet risin' in the night
I've dreamt or I've seen an angel in the sky 
I've seen an angel reachin' Paradise
Wide plains sweet air the highest mountains 
Calm seas old trees it's not fantasy
I've dreamt or I've seen a starlet in the sky
I've seen a starlet risin' in the night
I've dreamt or I've seen an angel in the sky 
I've seen an angel reachin' Paradise
Talk to my mind
Look into my eyes
With its magic it can control me
Jump in through the walls
Walk in through the men
With its magic it can control me
A cat is changing my dreams
I can't believe what I see
Cagliostro is playing with my dream
Stronger than a witch
Stronger than the death
With its magic it can control me
A cat is changing my dreams
I can't believe what I see
Cagliostro is playing with my dream
Only you can read my mind
Only you can save my life
Only you only you
Only you can read my mind
Only you can make me fly
Only you only you
A cat is changing my dreams
Nothing is what it seems
Cagliostro is playing with my dreams
Only you can read my mind
Only you can save my life
Only you only you
Only you can read my mind
Only you can make me fly
Only you only you
They're coming from a dying world where
The night reigns almost for eternity
They look like humans but they are
Cruel monsters faster than the others are
Leaving in the open while the wars
Are destroying men and all the world
They can hide their crimes to humans and
So they can rule over that lands
Bite
They can bite their victims to create
An army of immortals at their command
Or bleed their victims to increase
Their strength their knowledge and their immortality
They want our blood 'cause it is their feast
They are Masters of the Night
With our blood deep in we they can see
They are Masters of the Night
They're coming from a dying world where
The night reigns almost for eternity
They can change their bodies and they can
Read into the minds of feeble men
Fighting for a land against yourself
Fighting for a land until the end
They don't die with garlic cross and sun
But they die if they touch Dampyr's blood
They want our blood 'cause it is their feast
They are Masters of the Night
With our blood deep in we they can see
They are Masters of the Night
Bite
Are you ready to kill me
Are you ready to die
Are you ready to kill me from the inside
Are you ready to burn me
Are you ready to cry
Are you ready to burn me from the inside
By day by night
Thousand voices in your mind
By night by day
Thousand voices in your brain
Are you ready to shoot at me
Are you ready to die
Are you ready to shoot at me from the inside
Are you ready to crush me
Are you ready to cry
Are you ready to crush me from the inside
By day by night
Thousand voices in your mind
By night by day
Thousand voices in your brain
Take a walk in Take a walk in
Take a walk in Take a walk in
Take a walk in Take a walk now
In your sick brain
Take a walk in Take a walk in
Take a walk in Take a walk in
Take a walk in Take a walk now
In your sick brain
I have created a virus that
Will make dead men alive
It's not so perfect but soon it will be
`Cause I will give them a brain
Now they are only some cannibals that
Kill for the pleasure to eat
But if I want with an order they'll stop
Slowly undeads return to death
Not Alive
Not Dead
Without a brain
They'll wake up again UNDEADS
Who will get away
They'll wake up again UNDEADS
They want your flesh
Don't let them bite you
Or you'll wake up in the living deads' dawn
Through the undeads I will destroy the death
I'll create a new life on the earth
I'm the one I'm the legend I'm Abraxas
Nobody can stop me now
Not Alive
Not Dead
Without a brain
They'll wake up again UNDEADS
Who will get away
They'll wake up again UNDEADS
They want your flesh
Don't let them bite you
Or you'll wake up in the living deads' dawn
I walked through the desert to
Sneak into Memnon's camp
I found my way to enter
The sorcerer's tent
The guards discovered and caught me
Thanks to the treacherous Takmet
Buried in the sand to my neck
Left here to be eaten by the fire ants
If I become your lover
I will lose my prophetic sight
When I kill the Akkadian
I'll no longer need your gift of sight
 And the king will come
the king will come
 And the king will come
the king will come
The people will be saved
The kingdom will be free it will
Make its own destiny
 And the king will come
Deeper in the desert to
Reach the Valley of the Dead
I was hired to kill the sorcerer
But I helped her to escape
Memnon sent his righthand man
To kill me and to take my head
He gave him a secret weapon
To be sure to see my end
I've killed all the soldiers
Just one is still alive
This arrow from Memnon
Will stab your legs and slowly you'll die
 And the king will come
the king will come
 And the king will come
the king will come
The people will be saved
The kingdom will be free it will
Make its own destiny
In the Valley of the Dead
I'll no longer move my legs
The venom is killing me
Nothing I can see
I'm dying
I am healing you
I'm riskin' my life
The scorpion's blood in you
You won't be dying
You're the Scorpion the Scorpion
You are the Scorpion King
You'll ascend to the throne
You'll ascend as a king
Tonight I've had a vision
Memnon's armies will ride
through this place
They will kill the people
He will die by my hand
 And the king will come
the king will come
 And the king will come
the king will come
The people will be saved
The kingdom will be free it will
Make its own destiny
 And the king will come
In this world there is a war
Deep and damned for most of us
The war between the Word and the Void
The war between the day and the night
And here I am
I am a Knight of the Word
Every night I dream
Every night I see the future
What will be if I don't stop the Void
Demons and darkness pain and anger
This is my work
What will be if I don't stop the Void
One day I met the Lady
That's the voice of the Word
And so I could find my way
And my life will never change
And here I am
I am a Knight of the Word
Every night I dream
Every night I see the future
What will be if I don't stop the Void
Demons and darkness pain and anger
This is my work
What will be if I don't stop the Void
O'olish Amaneh visited me inside my home
And he gave to me a rune carved staff
When I touched it I crippled in my foot
It has given me the power but it reminds me to walk
Every night I dream
Every night I see the future
What will be if I don't stop the Void
Demons and darkness pain and anger
This is my work
What will be if I don't stop the Voideyes without life

Hatred rising hatred of your kind
Reasons denied and your soul 
Lies dead inside

As I journey to my darkest depths of my mind
and my soul to escape my Earthly woe I descend to my depths
To live on is to bask in pain Misery is thy mortality
I find myself amidst Labyrinthes of Depression
I wander the endless hallways bewildered by my thought
In the darkness of the labyrinthe I am one with my inner self
With memories of pain and misanthropy I long for these walls to be my grave
I embrace my shadowside in the darkness of this realm with a razor to my wrist
But there is a light Mighty Lucifer The light that is within Darkness
Guided by thee I embrace my eternity of pain to live through my life in depression
I find the deepest of thy self I wander the halls of this labyrinthe
of pain searching no longer for light The only way out is to die
I walk the Shadowed Path Clouded by storms of Anguish
the Earth is my damnation and rains upon thy fields of sorrow
But birthed in the root of Darkness thy wisdom shall sprout
the tree of true knowledge
Into the Moonless night I spit forth the venom of thy spell
A curse unto thy Adversary whose essence shall wither away
and so shall the Rose of Purity wither
I am the freezing touch that takes life away
I am the one whose soul is unclean
A master of dreams awakened to the night
I haunt the Astral and reap the mortal life
Through the moonlight's mist
I come to your soul
and beseech you with the kiss
of bitterness and woe
Below the depths I dwell
in lust for the crimson sin
As the rose purity turns to ash
I remember the taste of blood in my mouth
Veiled by the Night
I enter your soul
which withers from purity I defile
I am the dreams of lust and desire
a demon of sins of the flesh
Cold as the Winter's breath Internal as the forbidden wine
The virgin flesh of a maiden like the flowering white rose
Defiled by the lust which hungers penetrated in a thirst for sin
To be one with Darkness I transcend
Benighted ones rise like the flames of Paradise burning to ruins
Fallen is the throne with darkness overthrown the light drifts away
Glory to those who raise the Dragons sign before the altar of chaos
and chant the sacred names that conjure the benighted
Forever art thou
Eternal we live
For there is life in the Blood
AZRAEL  release my immortal soul
I embrace the Angel of Death
Through the blood my soul is forever reborn
The Blood that is forever shall flow throughout these veins
Awakened and eternal thy kindred shall usurp and reign
I rise unto the cosmos into the vast astral seas
I embrace the darkness for all eternity
Through the gates of rebirth I rise before thy deity
whom stirs in primordial Chaos
Thou art spawned from the sea
The Blood that is Eternal
of the Chaos Breed
Fills thy soul with hunger
to see thy prey bleed
Cold as the depths of Winter's frost our souls are ancient
Awakened art thou to the world of spirits of the plane
to walk the worlds eternally I am bestowed the pathway of the stars
The path of the Serpent that guides me unto everlasting life
I drink the blood that is forever embracing the Scarlet Sacrament
Ravenhaired and of my darkest dreams
Her pale touch is like the Winter's cold
Like the forest she obsessed my soul
and her grip will not let go
And in her heart flows immortality
for she is of Lamia blood
And through my dreams she came
to my soul for thy blood essence summoned her name
In rapture I embrace the bliss
of sins of the flesh
Immortal I drank from her soul
from her very veins
I indulge in the sins of lust
And the shadows dance to the chaos of her trance
As the flames within her showed her fire
Wicked are her ways of giving to thee the ecstasy I desire
And Cursed is her Kiss that is forever more
for it's aftertaste is bitterness
Upon the wings of the Dragon
I travel the serpentine path
Into the Nocturnal Forest
I enter the shadows of my dreams
Over my shoulder watching
A bloodstained freezing stare
Eyes of crimson watchful
Eyes forever in my Dreams
Into the Night my astral demon ascends
Through her visions
in bloodstained dreams
I watch the Lunar Glow
Eclipse to a crimson sphere
Somniumeus Nos Draconis
Somniumeus Nos Sanguinolentus Draco  Inluminare
dreams of the dragon spawn 
dreams of the bloodstained Dragon 
enlightened me
I rise unto the dreams of the Bloodstained Dragon
Awakened to a fathomless state
deep within my mind yet high as Mountains reach
Upon a universe of a dimension endlessly
A shadowed kingdom that casts on the light of the day
A kingdom from which I heir in the Nocturne embrace
A kingdom that the Dragon roams
In bloodstained Dreams of the Dragon
Red as the blood in Lucifer's veins
I enter the gate of the Master
For the path I have trodden many fold
Webbed throughout the cosmos
like cobwebs of cemetery
like shadows in the nocturnal forest
I find my soul wandering
Behind me she is watching
Her red eyes pierce the dark
In my bloodstained dreams
Where shadows spawn
Dominus Sanguinis Spiritus Sanctus
Feasting on the Blood penetrate the flesh
Jugular open wide spurting immortal life
Surging with power your blood makes me strong
Drinking from the veins of immortality
From roots of your soul essence deeply I siege the life
Lusting for the taste of fire that summons AZRAEL's sign
Tearing through her soul engorged her crimson bleeds
onto my tongue and chalice I drift into ecstasy
Pure was her heart and soul which the Holy Ghost had blessed
yet more pure was the mouthfuls of blood I drank from her breast
As her wine reached my lips I tasted sweetness foreign to my soul
sweetness of her holy pure blood I drained from her dying soul
Die for me
You shall bleed for me
a crimson scarlet sea
Gushing from your soul
the blood that I let go
Before thee thy fleshed wrist which veils the essence of my being
the blood of KINGU that flows amidst my veins
The blood that is eternal
Mighty is thy Magick and sharp is thy sword
TIAMAT forever art thou in eternity
I am drunk off the blood that flows in the veins of immortality
Feasting on the Blood penetrate the flesh
Jugular open wide spurting immortal life
Surging with power your blood makes me strong
Drinking from the veins of immortality
Indulging in sinful bliss I leave a bloody kiss
on the forehead of her corpse white face
Open are her veins that bled her soul
and granted me life everlasting
Drinking from the veins of Immortality
Entranced by the Magick that constricts thy soul
Empowered by the Force of Draconis
Under the dark sky whence Ursa Major drowns
into the depths of the horizon
I call forth the Serpent
Under her Mighty Spell
SARRATUM TIAMAT Hail to thee
For it is written She will arise
From Seas of Fire Dreaming of vengeance
Leviathan arise
Entranced under the Serpentine spell
I am guided by her flame
Entranced by the serpentine stare
I see visions arcane
Descending from red skies
Ugalla demons minions of KINGU
Exalt the Sign of Chaos
And TIAMAT Leviathan ascends from the depths below the seas
for blood she rises As it is written 7 Angels with 7 seals flew across
the sky and the first who broketh the first seal upon those who wear
the mark of TIAMAT failed in impotence For th e angel's magick
of God could not break the Serpentine Spell
Flames the Dragon spit forth smoldering feathers of angels wings
7 Angels of revelations falling charred from Dragon fire
and drowning in her seas
The elders are not watchful Attack
Those of the awakened rise up onwards to Armageddon
Claim the Throne of our fate and lead the venom legions to a bloody victory
Entranced by the Magick that constricts thy soul
Empowered by the Force of Draconis
Under the dark sky whence Ursa Major drowns
into the depths of the horizon
I call forth the Serpent
Under her Mighty Spell
Into a stormlit night facing the West altar
I chant the conjuration of the path of the Everlasting
the shadowed path of the Vampyre
Under the Serpentine SpellNow all's left the coldest days
The snow surrounds me in this place
I know I'll never see that side of you again
I'm forever trying to find myself but I've been gone
This past year so long
If all I know I can barely see then I swear
You compliment me well
You say we'll mean the world some day
Well I fell from my shoulders down
From this high I can see the clouds rain over me as I am now
If all know
The city stays awake for days until the sun eventually drowns
I am cast down
The start we had all underneath as if we stepped so carelessly
Now question keeps me up for days my doubt holds my heart to the ground
I feel you closer than before
I can still feel your arms around me holding me here
I can still feel the snow surround me you can't wait here
So sleep where you stand I can't stand to sleep knowing your safe
Just as long as you hold my breath now all's left the coldest days
So as I awake I brush the leaves from off my face
But they all turn to dust and grey my eyes will never see you
Know not where I am or how its come to this
I hang my head but not in shame
My bones are brittle watch them break like branches underneath your feet
I know I'm not safe in your hands I know I'm not safe
My words are cold now now that you left here
And all your tales are told through the cracks in your soul
And I know I'm not safe at all
The seasons all change into one and my concept of time has gone
I follow the sound of your footsteps to lead me away from here
Now the seasons all change into one as I awake I know that I
And the cold air seeps into my lungs I find it hard to breathe
Ill find my way away from here
I can't erase how I felt that day time won't change a thing
It looked so beautiful from here till I spoke
The feel of your skin against my lips is burning
Every word burns to ash on my tongue
And all my faith in you has gone
So let go
Now hope seems so far away
Am I the coward you became
I am hollow and it shows
And I swear that I'm not coming home
Distance fills the space between
Our fingers used to fit so perfect
But I have cuts on my hands
And I don't want to remember you as you are now to me
I can only hope and swear that I'm not coming home
The feel of the water reminds me
Your tears don't taste of salt
Your bitter soul
The fear in your eyes is blinding
It cuts through the cracks in your soul
I waited just in case you walked by
I could have caught your eye that evening
The snow the snow fell hard that day
But I couldn't care if I tried I wont forget that
I won't forget
I swear that its so I pray that I don't make it home
I swear that I wont make it home I won't forget that
The confidence that you portray
It turns to grey it pulls me down
The picture perfect painting fades
My doubt holds my heart to the ground
It doesn't matter what I say
I found a letter that night I wrote it in my sleep
I can still feel you here beside me it read
Dear if you're reading this
Dear if you're reading
You stand over me as I sleep
Your hands cover my eyes so that I cannot see your eyes
You'll be there when I wake up the snow it surrounds me
I can't wake up and you're here
Your hands cover my mouth so that I cannot breathe
Your breath is the cold that I feel in the air
You're the seasons the reason that I've lost all feeling this year
I wish that I'd wished you awayReign over you another day
Take all I can
Slave to me there's no other way
Break all I can
Come and taste me
Stay and praise me
Take all I can while I burn you down
Weak man
Weak man
You know you never will be free
Come for you time after time and again
Crawl with me
Give me what I need from you
Don't question why
On your knees in front of me
Weak man
Weak man
How long have I given all I've got
Here I stand
My days and nights now are solitude
I struggle on
I've paid my price
All I had I gave
So much still lingers inside my head
I've lost it all
No trace of tolerance I can find
An empty heart
I've paid my price
All I had I gave
Save all that you feel for me
I stand beside all that I am
Alive through all my fears
A drive inside me to succeed
Will that never dies
I'm spilling all my problems to you
I cry
You're deaf
So no one's hearing me at all
A weaker man would lose his faith
So many days without end
Undying need to take it all
Will that never dies
I've never turned my head to see
How it might have been
If I were weaker than my peers
I'd have given in
Burning hunger to rid you from my mind
You control me the blind leading the blind
You are poison but you numb all my pain
Dying slowly dying life that you drain
My blood is toxic and my veins burn for you
You are nothing but you're all that I do
You won't
You won't break me
You won't
Close the door put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through
They choose the path where no one goes
They ask no quarter
They want no quarter
They need no quarter
Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you
They choose the path where no one goes
They ask no quarter
They want no quarter
They need no quarter
I'll never lose the scars you gave
No longer can I live in peace
I'll carry anguish to the grave
Frustration that I can't release
SelfInflicted
SelfInflicted
To see you smile it cuts me deep
Knowing that you're no longer here
I see you dying as I sleep
Wish I could leave it all
SelfInflicted
SelfInflicted
All my pain is
All this pain is
SelfInflicted
SelfInflicted
Burn by love I taste the memories
I lick my wounds with pride
Count my days and nights in misery
Fueled by this rage inside
I can't look back
Can't look back
Nothing you could ever say to me
Could drain this swollen mind
Driving nails into my hands and feet
You left me crucified
I can't look back
Can't look back
I gave my heart and soul to you my friend
You let me fall
If you could only see what's in my heart
You'd take my hand
I've lived this life as a man would do
Why's it so hard to find the truth
My faith is strong within myself
I bleed of pride
Inside
I won't forgive
You can't take it back now
It's to hard to swallow
No words
No conviction
I've found the truth inside myself
But I am still doing time
Opened my eyes to what is real
This world is hard
It's cold
It's agony
Holding nothing
Scratch the walls just to survive
You can't fathom what that's like
You can listen to you lies
In the end you'll do your time
Holding nothing
Staring at myself again
What I see would swallow you
In your eyes I'll always be nothing
Never did you understand
Never did you give respect
Never did you ever love
Never
Never
Rule me no more
I control my mind
I will not give myself to you again
Weakness is pain
Your strength is twisting me
I've never felt so helpless and alone
I have failed 
I have fuckin' failed
Nowhere to turn
There's growth in pain I feel it
I pray to God it's not too late for me
Hard to believe one man could lose so much
All that I've lost can never be conceived
I have failed 
I have mother fuckin' failedDear citizens of the New Fallout
For too long our society has succumbed to the tyranny of our own actions
Wars riots we have tolerated the scum
And have graciously cleaned up the mess
Well no more
You have all been a consequence of the disease known as freedom
And now it is time to take that freedom away
As of today you will be stripped of your identity
And anything you hold dear in life
For it is your individuality that has led to your destruction
Your children will be left to rot as punishment for your indiscretion
And the lives you have lived until now will be nothing but a memory
This is for the survival of the race
This is for the New Fallout
This is the end
In the darkest night the faintest light is blinding
In the darkest night the faintest light is blinding
For my fallen stars
Bannermen ready for your call to arms
And for my broken hearts
It's time to take back what we thought we'd lost
For my fallen stars
Bannermen ready for your call to arms
And for my broken hearts
It's time to take back what we thought we'd lost
This is the resistance
It's a call to arms
The anthem for all those who don't belong
We're here to take our stand
This is the resistance
It's been far too long
That we've put all our faith in to the corrupt
It's time to start the end
Welcome new recruits to your evaluation and initiation course 
This system is designed to test your survival and critical thinking 
skills in Aeon City 
Please adjust the volume and do not move 
Welcome 
To the Resistance 
I've been a victim 
I've been a coward hiding underneath my pain 
I've been immobilized and watched the system 
Destroy everything I loved 
We cannot take this 
We must Resist this 
Who will you follow when the world fades to the grey 
Where can I turn when the world gives up on me 
I keep waiting in the dark for someone to come and save me 
And I've been holding on to something I can never change 
We all search for higher ground 
When the world comes crashing down but I know 
Nobody will come in to the dark and save me 
With iron claws and casted hearts 
I feel my fear just fall apart
I'm melted down to clear my past 
then forged from fire so that I may ask 
Who will you follow when the world fades to the grey 
Where can I turn when the world gives up on me 
I keep waiting in the dark for someone to come and save me 
And I've been holding on to something I can never change 
We all search for higher ground 
When the world comes crashing down but I know 
Nobody will come in to the dark and save me 
All new recruits 
We have been surrounded by scarecrows 
This is not a drill 
I repeat this is not a drill 
Runaway status is active to all new recruits starting immediately 
System failure 
Look what they've done to us 
Look what they've done to us 
Look what they've done to us 
I've grown so sick of hiding 
It's time we reclaim what's ours 
They try to say what we'll become 
And rearrange the stars 
I know I'm sick and fucking tired 
Of this mess they've made 
So let their arrows block the sun 
We will fight under the shade 
Welcome to the Resistance
I keep waiting in the dark for someone to come and save me 
And I've been holding on to something I can never change 
We all search for higher ground 
When the world comes crashing down but I know 
Nobody will come in to the dark and save me
Hey there shadow
You didn't seem to care at all when you watched me go
I know young love is just a dream
We were only seventeen
But you're the only love I've known
So please just let me go if you're done
'Cause it's hope that kills this heart
So please set me free kill the spark
I've been gone from this world for what seems like millennia
Looking for nothing short of a miracle
I only ever wanted to come home
Please won't you let me go
When I have nowhere left I can run away
Will you lie to me tell me I'll be okay
Close my eyes and lay me in my tomb
Then pull the trigger and send me home
So how did I get so far from my yesterdays
Another broken heart now just a memory
I should've left you in the dark
I should've left this awful town
And never found out how to love
So I don't wanna know about the things that you regret now that we're dead and over and done
Get away from me and leave my heart under the rug
I've been gone from this world for what seems like millennia
Looking for nothing short of a miracle
I only ever wanted to come home
Please won't you let me go
When I have nowhere left I can run away
Will you lie to me tell me I'll be okay
Close my eyes and lay me in my tomb
Then pull the trigger and send me home
So send me home
I've been gone from this world for what seems like millennia
Looking for nothing short of a miracle
I only ever wanted to come home
So won't you let me go
When I have nowhere left I can run away
Will you lie to me tell me I'll be okay
Close my eyes and lay me in my tomb
Then pull the trigger and send me
We hold on to the lies to feel free
So shackled by smiles so empty
We're scared of the war so we've forgotten who we are
We've traded in hope for safety we're raised in the smoke
Insisting that we're all too tired to light the fire
And shake the earth
But if all we are is just machines then let's become a miracle
And break free from these chains
We must be more than just machines
So let them hear our hearts so let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts so let them hear our hearts
Yeah
Where will you run when there's no place left for you to hide
When you're faced with the flood will you stand for the future
And swallow your pride
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who dares to dream
I scream at the top of my lungs I hope that I'm proven wrong
But if all we are is just machines then let's become a miracle
And break free from these chains
We must be more than just machines so let them hear our hearts
So let them hear our hearts
Where will you run when there's no place left for you to hide
When you're faced with the flood will you stand for the future
And swallow your pride
Where will you run when there's no place left for you to hide
When you're faced with the flood will you stand for the future
And swallow your pride
If all we are is just machines then we must be the cogs
Inside the wheels of change
We must be more than just machines
We can't afford to hide
We must embrace the pain
If all we are is just machines then we must be the cogs
Inside the wheels of change
We must be more than just machines
We can't afford to hide
We must embrace the pain
When the days had grown shortest and the leaves all died
When life became scarce and all was covered in ice
There lived a pack of wolves against every odd
That grew hungry and tired and needed to hunt
They'd sneak in to the towns in the dead of the night
And seek fire for comfort and warmth in the light
And though they weren't evil and knew it was wrong
They couldn't escape the lust for the blood
I am the ghost in the shadows
I am the fear of the dark
I am the murderer of apathy
An angel that's fallen
I am the psycho the sinner
I am what you can't escape
I am the splinter underneath your skin
I am a monster
With a bang
I feel my heart start to separate
The enemy within
Can no longer be contained
I'm running from myself
There's something inside of me
And it's ripping a hole through my chest
I spit the fire from my lungs
The creature I buried
Is now the beast that I've become
We pretend that we can be somebody else
But heaven's judgments nothing when
You're already in hell
So take these broken wings
They'll just slow me down
I'll never be the same I'll never be the same
And take my fragile heart
They'll just tear it out
This is the end of broken me
They call me to the lights
I am the ghost in the shadows
I am the fear of the dark
I am the murderer of apathy
The angel that's fallen
I am the psycho the sinner
I am what you can't escape
I am the splinter underneath your skin
I am a monster
I feel so god damn tired
And I can't escape the things I've lost
The cycle repeats and repeats
And I can't turn the fucking power off
I hate the things that I'm not
And I'm sick of how this has to end
I tried to reason with you
But now all of you are fucking dead
I am the living dead
I am the living dead
I walk through hell alone
And none of you can save me now
So take these broken wings
They'll just slow me down
I'll never be the same I'll never be the same
And take my fragile heart
They'll just tear it out
This is the end of broken me
They call me to the lights
Their voices just like thunder
They call me to the lights
But I am already gone what have I done
I am the ghost in the shadows
I am the fear of the dark
I am the murderer of apathy
An angel that's fallen
I am the psycho the sinner
I am what you can't escape
I am the splinter underneath your skin
I am a monster
Sh
I hear the static drawing nearer there's no way out
I breathe the ice and let the fire die
They keep on feeding me the chemicals I need to breathe
But how can something so important not belong to me
I can't pretend like I'm the one who's gonna change this but all I know is that our time is running out
I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go
So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness
I've made mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks
I've seen such hate surround me inside of this dark abyss
But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find on brighter paths
And out of the dust I see the light creep in and I know it won't be long
But I'm still terrified 'cause at least in the dark no one else can see who you really are
So bring me raise up your guns
And blame me for all of your wrongs
It seems hate is all I have left yeah it's all I have left it's the only thing that's left in me
I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go
So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness
I've made mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks
I've seen such hate surround me inside of this dark abyss
But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find on brighter paths
So when you feel like you're falling under holding on to the things you thought you loved
Will you let all of the things you've run from chew you up and spit you out
there's so much now
I get so tired lighting fires when I know we still have so much further left we could go 
So how much longer must I wait to fill this emptiness
I've made mistakes and had my dreams slip through the cracks
I've seen such hate surround me inside of this dark abyss
But all this pain just makes me certain that there's love for me to find on brighter paths find on brighter paths
Don't be scared we'll see the lights go out
When color starts to fade everything you see is tainted grey
As hope drains from your veins
Fear will slowly take its place
Feel the charge rush down your spine
Every hair stands on end in shock of your own mind
Lost in the sound of the pounding hearts
The wires have shorted the circuits gone dark
All it takes is a spark
The masquerade
Is lit ablaze 
Surrounding me as fear consumes my soul
There's a maniac within taking hold of me again
No place left for me to hide behind the eyes of a maniac
I'm a fucking maniac
Scarlet drapes my eyes the phantom calls from deep inside
Revealing my disguise the freak beneath has come alive
Suffering is all I'm wanting
You've been chosen for my haunting
The masquerade
Is lit ablaze 
Surrounding me as fear consumes my soul
There's a maniac within taking hold of me again
No place left for me to hide behind the eyes of a maniac
I'm a maniac a maniac a maniac
I am the bane of your existence
Feeble are all your attempts at resistance
Stealing your sanity watching you rot
Just lying in wait ready or not
Here I come
You stare in the mirror and the evil you see 
Is the menace within you that you have set free
Unleashing the beast brings the freedom you seek
But there's no escaping maniacal me
Am I too desperate too caught up in all the noise
Do I mean nothing another angry voice
Did I even have a choice Did I only make things worse
Am I just another angry voice
Then I hear the heart sing
HeyHeyaohaohaohaohaohaohhhh then I hear the heart sing
HeyHeyaohaohaohaohaohaohhhh
Will you remember me after the lights go out
Will you remember me after the sun goes down
Will you remember me after the lights go out
Will you remember me after the sun goes down and down and down
And when I'm worried then I'll look up to the satellites and hear them call your name
Then I know I can't be the only star in the world that's trying to burn
So look up to the satellites and hear them call your name
They're singing
HeyHeyaohaohaohaohaohaohhhh
I know that I'm never alone
On trial for our fates
we are The Runaways
Outta place with mistakes we never made
because all we are 
to anyone is just a Runaway
So fate found a day to take it all away
Cut down and encased inside a cage
Because all we are
To anyone is just a Runaway
Well if the waters so deep
Then why are all of you still standing
And if the sinner's asleep
Then how can I rattle his cage
I'm so sick of these dark days chasing me further under ground
But I'll find my way to light
And you'll find your own demise
We were not born the enemy
and we will not stop for anything
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall
Well how am I supposed to feel like everything will be okay
When you try to suffocate
What little is left of me
So fuck off you've dug your grave and I will be just fine
Cuz I'll find my way to light
It's always been here inside
We were not born the enemy
and we will not stop for anything
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall
So try to live with the things that you've done
and try to take all the things that I've loved
You won't break me I will rise above
This fire will burn until we fall
Run run running 
I keep running
I keep on running away
Run run running 
I keep running
I keep on running away
Run run running 
I keep running
I keep on running away
On trial for our fates
we are The Runaways
Outta place with mistakes we never made
because all we are 
to anyone is just a Runaway
So fate found a day to take it all away
Cut down and encased inside a cage
Because all we are
Is just a Runaway
We were not born the enemy
and we will not stop for anything
So try to tell me all the things that I've done wrong
This fire will burn until we fall
So try to live with the things that you've done
and try to take all the things that I've loved
You won't break me I will rise above
This fire will burn until we fall
Run run running 
I keep running
I keep on running away
Run run running 
I keep running

Run run running 
I keep running
I keep on running away
I keep on running away

I've wasted all this time just giving up
The revolution's starting
Why don't you try and stop it
We've lost control of our minds
You think we're giving in
It's time to prove yourself
So let the battle begin
Oh
We're not the same kids you used to know
So you wanna play this dangerous game
Well we're ready to go
Yeah we're ready to fucking go
So at the end of the world
Let's let em hear us say
We are we are we are the creatures that you've hunted
We are we are we are the ghosts of hope you've killed
Stand up stand up stand up we're taking back tomorrow
Become become become become the cog and crown
Ohah ooahooah
Oohaah ehaheahah
You think you're done with me
Like you can light the match and not get burned
We are the kids you love to hate
The ones that never learned
To be part of the system
We were born to tear shit inside out
So sharpen your teeth
And ready your guns
The Revolution starts now
We've already died if we give in to everything they ask
So become more tonight
We are your bloodline
We've already died if we give in to everything they ask
So become more tonight

We come as we are
We are what you're not
We come as we are
We are what you're not
So let the fire rise
Run you can't escape me
I am the air that fills your lungs
Fall you are the disease
But I'm immune to all you've done
Take back what's ours take back
We're taking back this world
So say your goodbyes
We're at an all out war
The world won't survive
But I'll chose how I die tonight
So say you're alive one last time
And let the fire rise
Rise rise rise
Wipe the ashes from your eyes and rise rise rise
Every end is a start's disguise
We're holding on to tomorrow
The day our flag will ascend
We are the voice of the hollow
We are the start of your end
We are the start of your end
So say your goodbyes
We're at an all out war
The world won't survive
But I'll chose how I die tonight
So say you're alive one last time
And let the fire rise
Rise rise rise
'Cause we chose how we die tonight
I start to levitate
I feel the air beneath my wings
I hear my pulse
I taste the air I breathe
I touch the ground
I see the end and I feel whole again
I hear the echoes of a world I'd left behind
I taste the victory I thought I'd never find
I touch the ground but it's slipping away
From me and now I can't see it
I can't see anything somebody out there please help me ah
Oh Johnny
Wake the fuck up
It's your big day
Wouldn't want to keep all those angry souls waiting now would you
This is the story of Johnny's group of misfits taking on the Devil himself
Welcome to Hell
I can't believe it was a dream
I walked the surface
Breathed the air then found myself back underneath
It must've been a sign
It's time to take back what was mine
I am alive
So it's time that I bid you farewell
I'll sign my release with your blood
You can't keep me trapped in this hell
I won't ever call this my tomb
The place where your soul's sent to die
Is the place where my purpose was found
I'm taking control of my life
And I'm raising an army from hell
And I'm burning this place to the ground
First I'll take the things he loves
Make him feel defeated make him feel defeated
Then I'll take his fucking heart
Make him watch you eat it make them watch you eat it
I can't remain here I'm taking control
So string 'em out and bare his bones
I'm taking back my soul
You think you can run
You think you can hide
No I'm done hiding
I challenge you to fight me to the death
So it's time that I bid you farewell
I'll sign my release with your blood
You can't keep me trapped in this hell
I won't ever call this my tomb
The place where your soul's sent to die
Is the place where my purpose was found
I'm taking control of my life
And I'm raising an army from hell
And I'm burning this place to the ground
So it seems it's my time
Fate has brought me to now
With armies aligned
We brace for the sound
Of ten thousand souls fighting for air
The chance to live again
So ready your guns prepare for the end
'Cause the last thing that you'll hear is
Off with his head
With the force of ten thousand guns
I destroy everything you built
Corner you with nowhere to run
Then I tear your black heart straight out of your chest
I took his crown of fire
And I crushed it with my hands
I came I saw and I conquered
So did you miss me
Well here's my farewell
I'm crazier than I ever fucking was
I'm king of the dead and the damned
I thought that this day'd never come
But why should you sinners be saved
You wouldn't be free without me
I'm your leader your savior your king
And I don't think that I'm ready to leave
So gather ye demons it seems it's your day
I sin but I've paid more than ten thousand graves
And though we're the damned we're so far from alone
So let's bury the hatchet inside of their skulls
Staring in the darkness
Dreaming about lost victories
I hear the sound of distant pipes
Calling out to me
Father I can hear you play
It brings back tears and memories
The lament of long lost regions
I will come to thee
Thousands of warriors getting near
All of them called back from the grave
The army you have sent for me
Mighty fierce and brave
Take me to my father
Take me back to the past
I'll carry him inside me
Guide me to the stars
Xioban  my daughter  listen to me
Your tears are dry  the time has come
To defend the honour of our clan
Force the en'my from our house
The blood of our clan runs through your veins
Beware the blackness of their hearts
Lament of lost regions has been heard
Fought my way through the massacre
Everyone's hate was fixed on me
You your mother and our clan
Gave me energy
I had to slay them one by one
Trying to reach the dark one's gate
I knew I had to stop him now
Before it was too late
One dark image blocks the sun
A giant warbird takes control
Its evil force shoots through my heart
Causing our clan to fall
Nothing more that I can do
My army slain  my power gone
I ride with Satan side by side
He takes my soul
Now I'm strong
Whoever slays a dragon
Will never take a fall
He's predestined to conquer
Let it be known to all
Crush my pride and honour
Make a fortune sell my skin
Divide me into potions
Slander my name black as sin
So then come the hunters
Sent by their messiahs
Blind men following sermons
Puppets in the hands of liars
You saw my pain  saw my soul bleed
You saw the anger towards your breed
There ain't no remedy against human greed
Why do you search for my defeat
Why do dragons always have to die
My strength and power feed their hate
They're frightened by the unknown
The legend grows  they fear my name
My image is carved in stone
So this is what my life became
Forever hide and seek
From day to day  a deadly game
The strong are feeding upon the weak
I lost my family
To the black plague
I asked God why
Did we make a mistake
I should have gone with them
Through the heaven's gate
I want my time to come
I know I'll have to wait
I saved half the town
With my recipe
Nature's secrets
Are all wellknown to me
I should have let them suffer
I should have let them die
Cause now they all claim
What a wicked witch am I
Belladonna
Make this nightmare go away
Sing me a lullaby it's much too late to pray
Use your sedating power
Make me close my eyes
Kill my soul
Make me sleep before I
Black clouds darken the sky
Still the Moon's so bright
I'm gonna die
On this dark and scary night
The priest leads them to me
And I wait patiently
Knowing what will happen
I'll see my family
I smell my flesh burning
Turning scorched and black
But I cannot feel
The flames that lick my back
Thank you belladonna
For protecting me
For now I'll die in grace
And not in agony
The air in our town
Needs to be purified
The breath of our enemies
Is spreading a lie
We're yearning for freedom
We're waiting for that day
It goes hand in hand
With bloodshed and pain
God forbid we yield
Courage is all we need
The Beast is on his way
We've lived for this day
on his way
The Lion has found his prey
No more slavery
No more chains
Kill this hypocrisy
Fight for what remains
Gather before me
Now hear what I say
None of you have lived before this day
Tolerate no longer
Oppression from below
Think of the children you'll be leaving on their own
The Beast is coming
He's swinging several heads
Each one is capable of killing with its breath
Drink from this ale
Now dance one more time
See your enemies' death in this wine
For ten thousand years
I fought every war
All engaged my skills
It was what I was living for
Violence kept me alive
I lived hard and fast
Each battle I survived
Always thinking it would be my last
Son of a thousand fathers
Bearer of no name
Keeper of your nightmares
Incentive to your pain
I ride my fearsome horse
I swing my poisoned blade
He who calls upon me
Embraces death as fate
I never chose a war
It would always find me
Never could I turn my back
It was where I had to be
Summon me as your ally
If you know the spell
I will slay your enemies
And you will pay your debt to Hell
The image that reflects
Right before my eyes
Is made of pain and misery
Scarlet flashes are all I see
You cannot flee
For I have come for thee
I'll take you on a journey
You will go back to Hell with me
Blood that spilled on our land
From traitors that scarred my soul
Brave men who did support my stand
You rotting cowards left me on my own
With covetous eyes
I drink your battle cries
The blood on my sword is dry
Deserted on a field
Betrayal in their eyes
My dream has been sold out again
They left me there to die
Night is coming soon
By my sword
Revenge will mark this day
Help me on my feet
Got me on a horse
Nurse the wounded bury the dead
I will ride again
One day I will be free
We'll kill this cancer eating our land
I followed the craven
Across the fields
With blood ignited in my eyes
No one will save them
They will concede
Defeat as I watch them slowly die
Lyrics by Nancy De Grave
Adaptations by DeathKnight
Once I emerged from no man's land
Existing of shadows
Your future in my hand
Some say I was sent here
Straight from the womb
Coming to protect her in this world of doom
You burned her forests
Turned her rivers black
Killed her smaller brothers
Locked her sisters to the rack
But now the end is near
The only thing upright
Mother will not see your fight
Mother was raped
More than before
Treated like dirt
Call of a whore
Black Knight was resting
I rose again
My plague'll bring back
Agony and pain
Unleashing bloody battles
in the christian god's name
Showing no humanity
taking no blame
I count on Mother's vengeance
coming over them soon
I read it in the Stars
in the changing of the Moon
I knew She would send me
Her great Black Knight
I abhor remorse
I kill who's in sight
None shall I forbear no exceptions made
With words I shall not converse
listen to my blade
My sword writes the odes
to mouldering decay
A song that's sung in unison
by all you living prey
My victims shan't be buried
they must burn
Human kind will never learn
I looked into the future
and I saw what had to come
Human kind will always be
so selfish and so dumb
I've seen black water
no forest to be found
No creature living safe and sound
To you I'm just a memory
An image of the one you loved
My eyes are cold and empty
When I'm looking down from above
To you I might be nothing
But I'm very much in pain
I realize I've lost you
And it's driving me insane
By the Lords that rule this world
I swear I will return
For my Kingdom and my Love
I'm shouting out
Iris tried to take my life
Deprived me of this coil
Here's my soul
And I know
She only took my body
The mortal flesh
Here's my soul
And I know
That even death can't keep us apart
Kneel beside my body
Never let it fall apart
From the smell of my withering flesh
To the stains on your sleepy heart
Reconquer my empty shell
Feel the armour on my back
Demons enter heaven
Only death can bring me back
By the Lords that rule this world
I swear I will return
For my Kingdom and my Love
I'm shouting out
The snow fell as it was born by Winter
Trees in black naked beauty
Came singing a praise
And hiding their gold like greedy gnome
Is burying his treasure dance snow
Winter covered their frozen roots
With the pillow of tender haze
Under which the grass fell into glassy sleep
Entering generous bliss
Mountains replied to me greeting the Queen
Of blowing winds and icecrystal worlds
And her flying servants that are never seen
Were carrying leaves as they came on the Earth
Whistling like trumpet on funeral act
Grey blizzard came releasing white snakes
And myriad of warriors in sparkling white dresses
Were carrying the tongues of the saints on stakes
White spears and swords
Ripped off angels' hearts
Cold was freezing their wings
And night slowly fell
On forest beneath
Like fingers of bard on strings
On forest lying under
Mountains of mine
Under wind whispering legends of time
And icestorm along
With the Children of woods
Sang joyful and furious rhymes
As abused angels left the Earth
The call of freedom started its way
I was going on the other side
Of sacred new day
To infinity of blinding black mass
Absorbing the mind
I was going on the other side
Of dying sun's heat
To icy and frozen nature
Absorbing saints' lives
And I saw burning shadows of the past
Along with crystal and fathomless lakes
and the snow fell as it was born by Winter
In the haughty mountain pass
Where the river's floating by
There was a great fight
But the legend lays in dust
I saw warriors fighting here
Tinkling of swords in the silent air
And the river was red
Of the bodies lying there
Bloody battle was over at last
Warriors lying as if they've slept
Under the crying wind
Their brothers by sword were waiting in the crypts
Granite rocks were standing in fear
Sky was cloudy and grey like tin
Upon the battlefield
Ravens had thir feast
And the only tower remained
Looking by its black loop holes
As the sun went west
It fell from the edge of the world
In the haughty mountain pass
Where the river's floating by
There was a great fight
But the legend lays in dust
Seeking knowledge hidden beyond blinding light
Lusting to taste the song of spectral pantheon
Step on the path decorated with pain and laid out with thorns
Find it's end and enter silver gate to hear the name of mine
My wisdom lies under dust on pages
Carrying prophecies of the Fallen Pride
My powers are free winds that lust
To unveil the moonless night
From it's pale dress of a compelled bride
By kissing candlelight
My flesh was born by roaring fires
Consuming bones of sageness covered with gore
My blood was created from the tears of tarblackened skies
Bewailing souls of legends that had withered before
My way lies under speeches of stars
Towards seas of fury hatred and scorn
My way lies under speeches of stars
Towards seas of fury hatred and scorn
Ashes of sunrays were covering my road to the far
I dance the nocturnal waltz on sparkling splinters of dawn
Ashes of sunrays were covering my road to the far
I dance the nocturnal waltz on sparkling splinters of dawn
I'm buried under sand trampled by one
Sentenced to be crucified
My confinement is irrigated by blood
Flowing down rough boards of the cross
I was meant to plunge into a slumber
Of pespirate plains never to wake
I'm spirit of those who tried to sip
My forlorn grace
But seers speak of my forthcoming rise
Rise to make my vengeance flow
Like rivers through all souls
Bound and shepherded by a bane
For springs of sacred
Pride that rides on widely spread
Black wings of serpent's children
Guarding impassable approaches
To ghostly pages' vault
Flames will be tapestries along the way
Depicting episodes of my
Reign beyond the misty shores of mind
My ascendancy will proclaim
Beginning of new epoch
Ceasing my oblivion for times
All powers will decay
While I'll take possession
Of trembling souls destinies and lives
My embrace will let
The heralds of my resurrection carry
Powers to embody all my wrath
Seeking knowledge hidden beyond blinding light
Lusting to taste the song of spectral pantheon
Carry my name until flesh is fraternized with Earth
Drowned among centuries I'm word
Where darkest ages mourn
Eyes
Were charmed by the sight
Of stone on the grass 
Grey mirror of sky
Stars
Lit golden tree crowns
With millions of fires
That showed me the road
To world
Of the tearcrying rains
That talk to the flames
And winds of the past
Where beauty 
The queen of free hearts
Was sister of those
Who despised the horde
Standing praying on the sunset
Caressed by tender wind
Ancient oaktree's spread its green arms
In the embrace of dusk
You saw legends with your own eyes
Ages grew under your feet
Filled with freedom and desire
Thoughts and feelings buried fast
Wake the secrets that you keep
From their deep eternal sleep 
Let them be the sacred whip
For the cattle hearts
Let your tar womb be sweet home
For the wisdom that will roam
Nature'll dwell under the dome
Of the ancient arts
Stone became red
Of the fury and pain
My thoughts and feelings
Were all faint in vain
When archangel sword's aura
Was licking the face
Of the shrine
Containing the ways
To unknown And the drops
Of the amber blood fired
Scarlet hearts and black souls
Making them feel the sight
Of the emerald eyes
Belonging to ancient sage
Bearing thoughts
Awakening the rage
Leaves were howling loud
Under weeping clouds
Moon was taking me
To the secret paths
Golden dust was making me blind
I saw slaughter of sheep and burial fires
Fingers pressed on steel
Making it start crying
Moonlight on the blade
Was the lightning bright
Grass was drinking red wine
I'd entered the world of dreams and desires
I'm breathing the rain at dusk
As I am tasting bitter burial silence
My soul is cold and weeping like a
Grim and misty black autumn night
I gaze at flowers fading to dust
And bearing the ashes  the seeds of the moonlight
Eternity steps on the fields of desires
Awakening the roots of sharpened sword's bride
Guided by tears of clouds
I'm wanderer sharing their dreams and fears
Watching whatever my eyes can see
Seeking whatever I find
Ravens bring dusk on their wings
Followed by night then fresh morning dew bears
Day while I'm going to place where I
Will end my fettered soul's cry
Exhausted by constant
Following blind eyes sight
While breathing road's dust
I search for place
That on this endless plain
Will be worthy of ceasing my way
I approach the hill
With the shining mist on the top and
Golden steps leading there
Threading on them
As I enter this mist I see
Couch prepared for me
Like storms on great seas calm down once
Turning themselves into froth kissed by evening breath
Tired I stop on my path
To escape from the load of eternal way seeking
On the bed surrounded by light
That covered it like a gorgeous dress
Feeling the nearby night
I lay myself to start my rest
As I awakened from my sleeping
I saw three chains of gold on me
Surrounded by white creatures gripping
My hands to put the cross in
Blood was washing my teeth in flesh
Of angels as I was breaking the chains
Day became night as I left this place
With thunder roaring around
My gaze caught only shadows of black
The eye blowing black consuming the mind
At the same time caressing my skin
With the waves of songs by night
Trees on my way were pressing
Nails into my naked arms and dry
Grass under feet seemed to me
Sharper than sword
As salty sweet of tears was seasoning
The taste of blood drops on my tongue
In the pits and the mists of my soul
I've found the road
of glory and pain
As the fear grows inside
Wrapping heart like silky lace
On maiden's dress during midnight dance
Bearing shiver and awakening lust
Being guide along dark marble halls
Through the mist surrounded by
Scattered beads of candlelight
Twinkling and fading air is crying
Sorrow and pain in it's cry
Are floating like lonely black swans
On the waters reflecting leed of gloomy skies
Time is coming so fast
Proclaiming hour for solemn requiem
Of soul that's singing it's grievous song
Of victim to be sacrificed
The moments left behind
Are reflected by the chambers of
Black castle that exalts
On the mountain of foresaken thoughts
Like feathers from the wings
Of ravens' horde foretasting
The massacre's blazing ride
Speeches of it's dwellers soar around
Let one word of yours be a knife in a trembling heart
Of prayer rising towards the falling clouds
Let each tear you utter now become a lake of blood
Of those who dedicated their existence to being blind
Let the flow of enchanted strain become your eyes
Seeing unique heady beauty of obscure
Plains spreading far and wide beneath the roots of mind
Where Chimaera's gaze breeds nightmares from desires
As the fear grows insane
Under wings of silent night
Winds are whispering thousand names
Of a multifaced divine
Rains of broken mirrors shade
Moonlit carpet weaved by stars
Words of velvet serpent's song
Are awakening from their sleep
Feel caress of flaming waves
Coming from the seas of fate
Taste the flesh of sharpened blade
Hear damnations as a name
Gate is opened granting pass
To the brink where perception ends
Dive into endless blackened chasm
Spreading soul like wings to fly
Eternally or die
If we surrender our liberty in the name of security we shall 
have neither
A deep sore dragged through ages
The sores are my own I know
Wounds collected through a lifetime
And wisdom I pick up along the way
I received the spit from a snake
And the snare cut real deep
I was caught in her womb
Something spreading in my veins
Those walls I faced alone I crept on bounded knees
The own will just vanished I wept my compassion away
with tears that flooded your heart No river leads back to mine
I bow down in soil and whisper
I gather strength to spread the disease
Somewhere along the railway a body divided in two
Somewhere between the screams those visions were never seen
I understood the voice
An ancient sacrifice
Buried in wreck
To rise up in a gaze
In marches the bitter man Fire away again and again
Hang dry curtains are down Sink down in dumping grounds
Sirens scream in your head when the march lingers on
Hear the echoes of the ceremonial doom
Through times I thought of what we created
For greater causes that brought us down to this
The ground is shaking from all the people below
One thing I've learned from this is
What you reap is what you sow
In elderly forms and surroundings
In the flesh of spirits incarnated
They are here for the hate forgotten
A rearview mirror to all lost souls
A slow burn shattered the field
Pain through body fire drained vein
Walk down to the watchtower
And with the right kind of eyes
See waves roll in and over
Never could you see the watermark
Man marches through the rust and dust
The burning fields will soon be ashes
Bodies woven in smoke and skin
And clouds descend to the sea
I see the bonds that tie belief
For this I choose to sink
Walk down to the watchtower
And with the obscure shapes
See smoke roll in and over
Never will we see the lights
What I have seen behind the frontline
Is what keeps me existing
I can feel it moving through me
Pure electricity
Shabra and shatila rises and retaliates
An invitation that raises the dead
I have seen their fate
The sun sets over holy land
And our last day advances
I can feel it piercing through me
The nails from god
Oh new day Wash my face and wipe these scars away
Clear my thoughts Imagine the last Empire's demise
Oh new dawn At last I have died and reborn
The rays burnt through my shell
My mission is summoning me
From the depth of earth I crawled
From Heaven's heights I've descended
The last one to know them all
The first to be rejected
Under cover of white light we meet at the first step
Digging graves for a dying world
In the river in thin air I am floating Hovering
Following lessons of past mistakes
Gathering knowledge as I grow stronger
I am the poisoned rain from a darkened sky
I am the burning water and the orphans' cry
I live in the ones who have fallen only to reach for the stars
I am the desert wasteland I am the spring run dry
When I arrive you become a hypocrite you become a liar
All that was sacred have I sealed in
The day I'll find you is the day I'll save your soul
The night is upon us and the enemy never sleeps
All sights melt down and follow to the end of time
They had risen to the skies and sunk in depths of gray
I am woven into the eyes of everyone
There's no hiding from this growing intense slaughter
The will of hunt and kill got you in a tight leash
In rains of crimson colors you lower yourself in blood
Now you will find yourself in the greatest collapse
The time has finally come and wrath has just begun
Dark intentions they meet again
Kill the vein that feeds your light
Take extractions down the grave
Seek them will not make you fade away
Meet the naked eye that beholds your spirit
Face the shadows of your soul in ashes
Follow the snakes into the burning flames
At the end of the road where lies turn to dust You'll find the 
remains of a girl and the truth that hurt too much Through 
her eyes you'll see that it's true what was said Wherever 
the river flows it's running red
Relations are artificial will we give it a new beginning
Find the essence in ourselves and escape through the tunnel
Transferring spirits The second coming
Shattering bodies and rising fire
A broken man came our way He'd lost his harvest
Sunken he gazed There lies the blessing
Forthcoming shadows are unfulfilled
Striving forward and deliver innocence
There lies the blessing
We are striving forward
Below the surface I swim
Holding my breath as I sink deeper
Watching the colors and the shapes
Searching for another way out
Clinging on to every last word
A shred of hope long since forgotten
All that is left is hate and regret
This world got the best of me
Further on Closing in
Falling down Giving in
To the beyondWe
Are
All
Dead
Every dream and every road leads to nowhere as they said the things that would one day come true and as we laughed our blessed memories came crumbling and our paths lead us eventually apart this day will come just like the truth of the words which we brushed off so well it's time to clear our lungs for the coming waters
These sentences slip past these ghost town images of my sundays indecisive this was the car accident coiled in lost perspective to horrid tales of expectation reread words wrote wrong into this disillusion somewhere in the insomnia of always not knowing i'd rather be dead
When we stood and wiped away your eyes and reached for our heart's last beat not once did you look back for me not once did you hold me without the thought of him switched off minds melt away in processed conversation barely breathing i am the diseased we are the hidden agendas staring as we are decaying eagerly waiting to breathe see we are all dead these burnt buildings for him and a city worn away i'll crush those roses before we meet again and for the fallen i've finally given up on you singed lips bleed softly from all to hell there's no fear in machinery there's no point in any of this
We set our heads to rest and fall out of form and grow numb enough to never move again we lose our sights and these roses no longer blossom i fail to hear these sounds now tightly our hands felt for eachother's when we said goodbye the exquiste architecture ruined our blessed nights and we can no longer pretend for months for these memories to melt away at the most akward of moments this is my last word my lost love we will never meet again
The rain now floods the bridge we stood so desperately between the sky has lost its color seperating the battered from the dead almost close enough to kiss the tears from your face as i lie beaten and unable to stand remembering when we said let's just sleep and pretend that this is never going to end ten days to come three weeks to pass and now she's gone again the most delicate of love shatters somewhere between the lines somehow between the fights and sometimes the print drips ink that we'll just never understand these gifts are held in warning to them and we can't forget she's gone
Drawing this box for you to recreate me into something i can never be disease turned these clouds a infinite light and the winds a translucent glow it seemed so easy to quit everything to remember transmitted recordings of robot tracks to forget how everyone sounds tightly formed mechanical wings dwelling on how to save us all never in control never really having a chance we're all useless with our eyeliner dripping in red we let it fester always knowing that it was coming and i'm hearing things in my head i'm hearing things all wrong these arms failed to lift when my eyes forgot to open everything left offsetting through the dryed paint that creates these butterfly wings twitching and teasing now standing here one year later with signs of red shining through a decade more among the morning light of bedroom walls deafeated to know the danger in this it's so easy to forget everything we swore we'd remember we're all useless if only i could keep the eyeliner from running i'd drive these roads to kill my own kind
When we see each other again will it be this cold tired from the week and unscheduled events i hope i understand wide awake my eyelashes desperately flutter to let myself fall back into what she had woven so well sealed lungs shut with your open mouth to my spine early morning to make it through this haze beautiful memories now only haunt me things like this never last wasted time rearranging what i was trying to omit leaving the saliva scented ruin upon my wrists so young wasting this tired life on endless thoughts and endless nights and i end up nothing to you not a fucking thing and i am fucked up again i was nothing to you i guess the talents will always outweigh the flowing constant streaming so perfectly through trying to erase the now for then i have dreamt every night of being on that train with you but i won't be on that train tonight i'm not at your convience
Pull these scars from my face of overreacting scissor snip the concrete hollow medication programmed thinking thinking almost as fast as me we wore out talking in unfamiliar language i dreamt of philadelphia thinking it was new york i wished for this hoping it was real over the ringing of my chest i heard the phone and in this dream she came in red hair for every inch of her was delicate and detailed by a fond interest and i'll give anything anything to be put back at ease for anything i'd forget myself to become the dance so you'd be in love with me i wished for you hoping this was real counting hours of sleep to catch some cure and just an ounce of rest the texture kills these nostrils these photographs flood fading to their complimentry Roraschach tests biting at nails as you sleep quietly amongest the feathered lights of easing tranquility i kiss myself to catch any taste of you left upon me i hold the empty air believing only for you i drown in these tears and every sentence runs through over and over to become deadly comfortable
Seeing in fevers going blind from all the cancer that bound these wires together to end the communication the distance from it all is what it takes by then it will all be over we all fail from disorders
Letters smear like butterfly wings for this pulse which lost itself into mechanisms and diagrams she found me upon lonely traveled roads wading through these unforgiving waters through the unfamilar voice of acheivements and this coincidence these are the subtle moments that frame us with her voice now heard across these great distances we couldn't keep our arms around each other long enough to fall in love silence clenches this throat in ten years past
Away from the rivers we gather our things for tonight apart from the ocean the smell of this worn away machine carrys her away alone i said to myself i will wait for you the city shined shades of white tonight covering all the filth it almost seemed safe here clouded city now hidden by the crowded structures and her lost citadels you never wanting and me never knowing we move on tired angel buried beneath the towering divide come back to me wake from your slumber for all the reasons these fingers never wanted to quit drawing yours these words were all for you like a story she read once i lie in an empty bed together we're better seperate i'm better off alone this quick romance has killed meEyes full of hate quick to condemn
Just stay in the dark and wait for an end
You don't really care it's jut give and take
Keeping the distance keeping it fake
Waiting for something that doesn't quite jell
Just cursing existence and hating your hell
Blinded by anger you don't really know
It's play by play as you put on a show
Your making your stand for nothing at all
Delighted with problems a chance for a fall
Causing a scene to distribute the pain
It's all for one such a nice little game
Your time flies by with nothing gained
Just talk of change and who's to blame
It's the same old story we know so well
With a premade ending you don't wanna tell
Still waiting for something you haven't found yet
Just hide behind vices and a bunch of regrets
Blinded by anger that won't go away
Treading on water as you sink day by day
Manifest Destiny
More blood on the hands of Christ
They called themselves Christians
And gave themselves the rights
Disguised as missionaries
They were really after gold
Many Indians died for that
How many's never told
Manifest destiny 
Forever moving onward
Said they were guided from above
Actually driven by hate
Disguised as love
But all their false love
Can't disguise true hate
And the racist diplomacy
Of the church and the State
Manifest destiny 
The church must be rich
With all that gold
But they'll never return
All that they stold
It sits in a vault
Built just for gold
And there it will sit forever
Because it never gets old
Manifest destiny 
I call you up
You've got nothing to say
I get the hint
And I'm blown away
Been gone gone too long
I've been gone too long 
You must see me
In some far away city
Wonder is she blond
And is she pretty
When I'm gone so long
Our bonds grow week
Trust gone sour
Cause we can't speak
Been gone gone too long
I've been gone too long 
I wake up at night
Drenched in sweat
Another nightmare
I can't forget
Drinking and thinking
About what could have been
Smoking and trying to
Live with my sin
Been gone gone too long
I've been gone too long 
Conform  It's only need
Distort  Not what it seems
Resort  To the deed
Report  To the machine
Modern day vendor that sells you hell
A line is formed will you live to tell
Money  machine become all one
Hand to hand the damage done
Conform  No not alone
Distort  What's always shown
Resort  The need again
Report  The machine again
Was it over when it started
Has the warmth since departed
Did you put your life on hold
On the shelf while firing the load
We won't mention names
But why don't you ever shut up
You're constantly talking
And I just can't keep up
Conversations a joke
Is your head made of oak
Endlessly blabbing
But sometimes it feels like you're stabbing
Shut up  shut the fuck up
Bragging and lying
So you won't have to stop
I've got to get out
My head's about to pop
You know who you are
C'mon give me a break
You go on and on
Until I feel faint
Shut up  what are you deaf

How can you be
So quick to condemn
By word or rumor
Heard from a friend
One can't believe
All that one hears
It's your decision
And not your peers
Think for yourself
Don't rely on someone else
How can you say
That I'm that way
You don't know
Just heard it was so
You're against me
Well how can that be
We've never met
Your opinion's been set
Think for yourself
Don't rely on someone else
Inspect each situation
See from both sides
Seek out the truth
Bury the lies
One can't believe
All that one hears
It's your decision
And not your peers
Think for yourself
Don't rely on someone else
Old battered building
Ready to condemn
High valued property
Expensive piece of land
Half fill with tenants
All poor on welfare
No heat or electricity
And slumlord doesn't care
Slumlord doesn't care 
Millions in insurance
Covers the wrecked lot
And a week till it's condemned
Is all slumlord's got
He enters the basement
With three gallons of gas
And four hours later
There's nothing but ash
Slumlord doesn't care 
The newspaper's all read
Forty die in the blaze
Slumlord now thinks
That crime really pays
And two years later
A skyscraper appears
With a plaque in the memory
Of the forty that died here
Slumlord doesn't care 
A pretty young girl from the Oakland hills
Stole her dad's car and all her mom's pills
Got all fucked up and drove off a cliff
Ended up dead dead in a ditch
Just like her mother always told her she'd end up
All fucked up dead dead in a ditch
Suit and tie guy
With his fashion phases
And his quarterly raises
Feels he's better than you and me
Suit and tie guy
Thinks he's real cute
In the bathroom for a toot
Until his nose starts to bleed
Suit and tie guy
I see he always hurries
I know he always worries
He's gonna die of a heart attack
Suit and tie guy
On his way to feeding
Or an important meeting
Just like a car on a track
Suit and tie guy
He travels between stations
With certain destinations
Never varying from that routine
Suit and tie guy
And he'll tell you in one word
That he is insured
And it's not as bad as it may seem
Sadder than any song I've sung
Is growing old or dying young
This earth is a grave round and green
A tomb of sorrow which I've seen
A massive field we wander through
Great sky above vast and blue
Death may come in a day or two
Whether or not I'm false or true
Man without an answer
Like a bird with broken wing
Wrapped up in his misery
Forgetting how to sing 
Straight from the stretched out womb of sin
The horrid fire bombs will fall
Here is hope for priests and preachers
Here is heresy for all
So man unkind will perish
In a final fiery blaze
Or suffocate himself slowly
In his smoggy yellow haze
The sun so sore from marching
Towards that receding west
Where pity no longer governs
With wisdom as his guest
Will rise somewhere south of east
Our sun will rise in morning
Wishing it could quench with tears
The fields and skies all burning
Will our children look back
With hatred or despair
At a generation of idiots
Who just didn't care
About the fossil fuel fumes
And the aerosol sprays
That put holes in the ozone
And let in the rays
That can cause cancer in humans
And what is it all worth
Heating up our globe
Destroying our own Earth
What will they think
Of us with no concern
About the seas of shit
And radiation burn
We who watched
The waters of the world
Turn to lakes of lava
Killing every form of life
Will they have regrets
For being born at all
Into a world where only
Acid rain can fall
On all the empty fields
And on the vacant lots
Where cockroaches and crab grass
Are the only crops
Acid rain dissolving away
The monuments of man
Run for your lives
Acid rain
Smell the rain coming
Acid rain
Run for cover now
Acid rain
The water is on fire
Acid rain
Tone deaf  I can't play an instrument
Tone deaf  I can't even sing
Tone deaf  I have to wear ear plugs
The noise makes my ears ring
They told me when I was eleven
You shouldn't even bother to try
You've got no musical ability
And they weren't telling a lie
Tone deaf  I've got no rhythm
Tone deaf  I've got no pitch
Tone deaf  I couldn't hit an octave
If it meant that I'd get rich
All I can do is shout
Louder and faster than most
That's what I do for a living
Traveling coast to coast
Tone deaf  I don't have good meter
Tone deaf  I can't sing tremolo
Tone deaf  I've got poor register
You won't hear me sing falsetto
No I can't hit those high notes
And I can't go real low
All in all I'm tone deaf
And everyone tells me so
Tone deaf
My body is stupid
But my brain is smart
Luck rules both of them
With the help of my heart
Like a stumbling moron
Unable to obey
The simplest laws
Of morality
I'm the saddest excuse
For a human being
Wish my past was slate
Which I could wipe clean
But who can I blame
There's only me
I screwed up
I'm guilty
Guilt trip
The guilt trip
Guilt trip
I'm on a trip to the land of guilt
I've been here since the house of pain was built
The price is high but when I need relief
I'll pay the price when I feel the grief
Out of the woodwork
Here you come crawling
On your knees hands out
I think you missed your calling
You want a percentage
Imaginary piece of the pie
Take a number get in line
Asshole  nice try
Cause we're playing hard ball
Now we're playing hard ball
You threaten lawyers
Go ahead and call
Sounds like fun
Cause we're playing hard ball
Now we're playing hard ball 
Now we're playing now we're playing hard ball 
You want to play with us
Well step up to the plate
The bases are loaded
And we tire of the wait
I'd love to go to court
Just to see you fail
And end your pathetic attempt
At extortion and blackmail

IS THIS YOUR CURRENT ADDRESS
I've lived in a van and i've lived in a tree
Never did what anyone expected of me
I ate at soup kitchens and i slept in squats
Abandoned buildings and parking lots
I borrowed money and played for free
Living in america in poverty
Pay paying to play
Pay paying paying to play
Pay paying to play
Pay paying paying to play
But a tour or a show was always in the works
With coc the dks or the circle jerks
We would play for beer for food and for gas
Eating government cheese and trading blood for cash
I was always hungry tense and weird
Trench coat mange half a beard
I slept on park benches and i'll never forget
The cold and rain and all the shit
Everyone with money and me with none
When you don't have any it's not much fun
Pay paying to play
Pay paying paying to play
Pay paying to play
Pay paying paying to play
Go ahead and say it what have you got to lose
Go ahead and say it no need to hold back
Go ahead and say it voice your opinion
Go ahead and say it while you still have the right
Why keep it all bottled up inside
Say it loud and at least you've tried
Someone hears and you're on your way
Something on your mind you have to say
Say it go ahead and say it
Shout and let it out
Go ahead and say it say it
Go ahead and say it don't care what others think
Go ahead and say it let your thoughts be known
Go ahead and say it voice your opinion
Go ahead and say it while you still have the right
Living your life like you're satisfied
Hold your tongue and you swallow your pride
Peaceful and golden as silence may be
There are some thoughts you've just got to set free
So say it
Go ahead and say it the time is right for change
Go ahead and say it you can make a difference
Go ahead and say it voice your opinion
Go ahead and say it while you still have the right
I was drinking beer then i was drinking jager
I know i shouldn't mix the two i always pay later
But that's just beside the point what is done is done
Now i'm hurting real bad and i've got the runs
I hate the dry heaves i hate dry heaves
I hate the dry heaves i hate dry heaves
I was talking to you then i was on the ground
When i shut my eyes everything spun around
When i'm so fucked up i forget where i am
I feel so bad i puked in your van
Gutwrenching spasms that just won't stop
Trying to squeeze out just one last drop
My gut tied in knots nothing left inside
Thank you so much for giving me a ride
I hate the dry heaves i hate dry heaves
I hate the dry heaves i hate dry heaves
You don't know who i am
You don't know what i want
You can't see in my head
You can't even imagine
You don't know what i'm feeling
You don't know what i'm like
You don't know what i'm dreaming
In the middle of the night
So please please don't ask 
You don't know how i work
You don't know what makes me tick
You can't tell if i'm healthy
Or if my mind is sick
You don't know how i am
You don't even want to know
You can't know what i'm thinking
You don't even want to know
So please please don't ask 
You don't know how i work
You don't know what makes me tick
You can't tell if i'm healthy
Or if my mind is sick
You don't know how i am
You don't even want to know
You can't know what i'm thinking
You don't even want to know
So please please don't ask 
Time out time out for the beginning of the end
Time out time out of man's episodes of sin
Time out time out glacier melt down overload
Time out time out unnatural disasters
Time's up for us mindless beings
It seems we're destroying everything
The jungle the seas the forests the trees
This neverending need has to cease
The cost is always growing
Animal life loss is overflowing
Our stained shores take devastating scores
As man's black tides roll in
Time out time out screaming mother earth
Time out time out riddled seas of chemical birth
Time out time out for our backyards laced with toxic waste
Time out time out extinction is forever man
What gives us the right
To kill for ivory in sight
Makes me sick to see fur jackets and sleeves
When lives were taken for her to please
People can't we see
Respect has always been the key
Global warming and pesticides
If the earth goes we'll all die
Time out time out time out
Time out time out time out
Let it go let it go
Let it go let it go
Leave it alone let it go
Learn when to shut your mouth
Leave it alone you gotta know
When to just let it go
I hope for the best but i expect the worst
I'm a realist at heart searching for treasure
Buried wherever no hints and no chart
Screaming and loving pushing and tugging
What is right and what's wrong in my wildest dreams
I never imagined it would last this long
I was counting the days now i'm counting the months
When will this all end could be a year
Could be never or just around the bend
I know it's hard to show you care
Like spin the bottle it's truth or dare
Opposing sides from your position
Don't' give a fuck that's my decision
You are so unkind that look on your face
Hey i'm not afraid to roll the dice
I've made mistakes before but i've served my time
At least i've got my memories i'll put aside my losses
And show you how to win the game
Leave it alone let it go
Learn when to shut your mouth
Leave it alone you gotta know
When to just let it go
Today i want to be with you for the rest of my life
Tomorrow i may never want to see you again
That's how it goes people change
But you know that i don't have to tell you
I think about you all the time
I think about you all the time
I never wanted this i was having fun
Before i met you falling for anyone
Was not on my agenda but it still happened now
I think about you all the time
I think about you all the time
I don't' have to tell you you know that
I think about you all the time
I think about you all the time
Tomorrow  before i met you
Falling  not on my agenda
People change  it still happened
Thinking about you for the rest of my life
Somewhere out past nowhere
I was born in the middle of an air raid
Since i hit the dirt i was on the run
The son of a gun and a switchblade
Got my uzi lying on my bed stand
I made napalm in my sink
Pipebomb in my pants pocket
I just put cyanide in your drink
Mic stand's always at my side
Jackknife in my boot
Fully automatic machinegun
Is loaded and ready to shoot
I strayed off the beaten path
Now there's no place to hide
My sadness and my wrath
Contemplated suicide
Somewhere out past nowhere
I lost my way
No money to pay my fare
The driver drove away
I remember sunny winter sundays spent
Shooting at the sun with my bbgun
Thinking this is the way that life should be
Some birds some bbs my gun and me
But that isn't the way that life should be
This is the way that life should be
Guitars drums a mic and me
The band some roadies electricity
Blasting forth with a million watts of power
The weak get sick and the timid all cower
'cause we're like a gun and we're taking aim
Out music's the bullet the target is your brain
The guitar like a laser cuts through your head
You drop to your knees and wish you were dead
Than i grab the mic and i start to shout
Your eardrums burst and your brains drain out
When the bass kicks in your bones are crushed
Your eyes roll back as you get a rush
Then the drums pound you right into the floor
Now you're rotten to the core
reflections of a damned
by fiendish symptoms send
sarcastic roars of laughter
from far away it sounded
the rulers of eternal suppression
awaking from their hybernation
plundering and subjugation
bloodtrails gomorrah of the plains
no worthly penalty
never met their destiny
who'll take the part of catching hands
to get this scabby jacks
the rulers of eternal suppression
awaking from their hybernation
plundering and subjugation
bloodtrails gomorrah of the plains
reflections of a damned
by fiendish symptoms send
sarcastic roars of laughter
from far away it sounded
the rulers of eternal suppression
awaking from their hybernation
plundering and subjugation
bloodtrails gomorrah of the plains
hells breaking loose when the daltons rode
terrorizing aims get off the ground
fellowship by brotherhood in arms
despising law and order got remand
their soul has slept in cold eclipse
roused by fighting spirit
following the promised way straight
to the dawn of dying
dancing to the beat of the singing guns
another soul is passing by
at the dawn of dying
the dawn of dying
barrels sight their heads in coffeville
lured into the trap the end is near
at least the dead await the final storm
baptized in fire bodies to adorn
bullets flow dehumanized
but the purge is done
within the one who told the story
within the truth about the glory
of the dawn of dying
the dawn of dying
forever crucified at the judgement's wooden spine
the final pulse of history
forever buried there where the others lie
old west infinity
perfect genocide is computerized
the laughing face of death around
the warning that nobody realized
will take us to the dawn
the dawn of dying
the dawn of dying
you pave the way for my robbing leech
there are no bounds and the souls are free
when rivers run backwards and the time stands still
you'll stand in my path than you will see
all I need is just ten foot ground
and no emotion can stop the sound
of aggressions that leave you alone to your blood
evocation of everlasting brotherhood
I'm tired of your slanderous mockery
you're just a traitor without daredevilry
I have to face the man who wanna take my life
you know that I'm prepared for the fight
hey ho the final row
mournful fatal misery
hey ho the final row
with my gun and me
all I need is just ten foot ground
and no emotion can stop the sound
of aggressions that leave you alone to your blood
evacation of everlasting brotherhood
you see the tension in my staring eyes
look at my hand that's leap and strike
don't wait to long and stop to breathe
cause heaven awaits that somebody decease
all I need is just ten foot ground
and no emotion can stop the sound
of aggressions that leave you alone to your blood
evocation of everlasting brotherhood
hey ho the final row
mournful fatal misery
hey ho the final row
with my gun and me
we took a little trip just you and me
the lead that put us out of misery
no one will ever hold us in contempt
decision between the quick and the dead
praying to the wretched beasts
maybe they can forgive
the warriors of haunted souls
and common mavericks
sorrows of their inner lifes
hope burned down in flames
a king would trade his finest crown
to get out of their way
hearts will break a thousand times
not even just in dreams
guns will wait a thousand nights
gone with the wind
gone with the wind
dying with their boots on
the shadows of the proud
still sounding in their ears
the mating call of gold
places of immortality
millions sacred tombs
no medicine will ever heal
that never healing wounds
hearts will break a thousand times
not even just in dreams
guns will wait a thousand nights
gone with the wind
gone with the wind
upon a land where glory lies
the might of suns and moons
eternally under the sky
covered by the truth
when gods would lay their weapons down
and no more war to fight
you'll see em at the long horizon
finally unite
gone with the wind
gone with the wind
a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
pursued like a wounded deer
branded inhumanity
crime controlled
wild instinct to stay alive
the morning that will never die
fire down below
deep in my mind
can't be denied
out of sight
like a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
like a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
when they set my skin on fire
last resort desire
I can't resist
the man they couldn't catch
is the man they couldn't hang
they'll spiteful kissed
balanced on the edge
inseminated death
skeletons left behind
by a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
by a rattlesnake shake
a rattlesnake shake
blessed by the gods
which path will he take
visions of freedom
that never awake
they don't shoot him down
and they don't hang him up
but the rattlesnake's bite
and the sun burning black
a rattlesnake shake
An old cowboy went out on a dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of redeyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged sky and up a cloudy draw
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh
Ghost riders in the sky
Their brands were still on fire
and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shining
and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him
as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
and he heard their mournful cry
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh
Ghost riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
and shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that head
but they ain't caught them yet
'cause they've got to ride forever
on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting as they ride
and hear their awful cry
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh
Ghost riders in the sky
As the riders loped on by him
he heard one calls his name
If you want to save your soul
from hell riding on your range
Then cowboy change your ways today
or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd
across these endless skies
Yippie ayeaaa yippie ayeooh
Ghost riders in the sky
riding the devil's horse
I'm riding the devil's horse
the sinister curse has me in it's spell
degraded scalps that adorn me so well
and every time when your death glare meets mine
a phantom is gazing through cynical eyes
bounded so faithful by spiritual beasts
scattering splendors of worshipping deeds
no mercy will pump out the damned tears in me
predominant signs bring just tragedy
to the perdition  that keeps me alive
riding the devil's horse
I'm riding the devil's horse
the devil's horse
it whispers to me with languishing lips
the evil is hunger and the fire I breathe
I know that there're two ways for me to walk on
within my rage under final command
and power was given to me by the sword
the day of my wrath who'll be able to stand
nobody surviving the passage of blood
and hell follows me when I'm rising up
so follow my trace  to the destiny
riding the devil's horse
I'm riding the devil's horse
the devil's horse
I dreamt I was in heaven
among the angel's gold
feeded by a pleasant hand
that dealt the playing cards
no sorts of bones whatever
creeping on the ground
'cause bonds of faith may always sever
but my gun is still around
now I just found a game
like a mortal upper story
play the final showdown scene
'til you are gone to glory
both friends and foes agree
accused of breaking laws
there is no money in this secret box
the fodder to my purse
maybe I am wrong
maybe I am right
maybe I'm not strong enough
maybe I will die
like a tawny snake
in a torrid clime
the twilight
'til the dawn of time
maybe I disclaim my honour
maybe I will jumping down the running train 
jumping down the running train
 jumping down the running train
the ballade of Jesse James
there was a little lady
she was twined in golden hair
don't want to take her to my heart
'cause dollars doesn't smell
she felt down on her knees
I cant forget the sound
'cause bonds of faith may always sever
but my gun is still around
from the deepground of the ocean
to the top of mountains high
where love threw up the sponge
fear got the upper hand
an insidious bullet from behind
the coffin let me learn
there's no money in this secret box
just fodder to the worms
maybe
threatening predominant thunder growls
sending felonious packs of hounds
dust covered the peace from bad to the worse
the silly red breed was about to burst
a place where the angels got prostitudes
and gods are precursors of breaking rules
casting a gloom over those who believe
that beasts could be changed into human beings in dodge city
that beasts could be changed into human beings in dodge city
denaturalized in a sea full of blood
no security to find in this crimson mud
dishonouered town too tough to die
like a leaf that is caught in the endless tide
a place where the angels got prostitudes
and gods are precursors of breaking rules
casting a gloom over those who believe
that beasts could be changed into human beings in dodge city
that beasts could be changed into human beings in dodge city
nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide
sing the song
you better keep inside
with loaded guns
on holy ground
like a deadly punch
desperados in town
nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide
don't try to be strong
don't even try to fight
for when we'll be gone
you might still be around
and you sing this song
'cause desperados in town
showdown has come
with deadly sound
it's a quick draw game
desperados in town
nowhere to run
and nowhere to hide
searching for a lucky game
or been thirsty by the way
come on boys and listen to me
don't pray the god that you should see
a place where all the honest men
the desert mice the desert rats 
wholesome honey stay alive

pretty maids bear up your pall

oriental saloonTruth must be kept veiled
Drowning in complexity
Brimming with void
Devoured by doubt
You're bound to fall as we all are
You will strive for an answer
I will seek for a sense
We shall pray for this emptiness to be filled
The axe of wisdom falls right through my neck
Desecrating every last taste of vitality
You're compromising
Disgracing the last drops of a source
The source of a circle I thought I could close
Eternally you shall strike against yourself
Convictions will drag you into failure
Face that we're not meant to understand
Mesmerize me with your chant
Kill me with your voice
I'll fall as everyone
I'll be the first to rise in torment
Fingers glide on me
So real they seem to sink
Into this skin of mine
And vanish within
Blessed be the poison that runs through my veins
I am back from depths
I can hear the scream of this world
Why don't you make you own move
Staring at this wall
Carrying the screams of them all
Standing in balance
Out and away
Reset your eyes
Erase your mind
You are the plague
That infests your own flesh
Realize it will never be the same again
Reset your eyes
Erase your mind
Running away from a place where everyone is exiled
Trapped in their weak mind
Hampered by stereotypes
We are our own obstacle
The hidden daylight
Above the laden clouds
Glare of gray
Chewed and spat
In a far and cold desert
The dying rain carves on my faces
Thousand names of thousand victims

When all stars shine down on you
And silver moonlights too
A perturb breath of heaven
Sources of fear arise in you
The wind is fresh and cold
A statue cruel and wanted
Dreadful noise approaches to you
Fear juts in the night
Thoughts pulsate in your head
Keep me alive and save my soul
Fear juts in the night
Fellow or anger
Squander your time
Better surrender the deluge of spite
Morbid motives day dreams from within
Death row for all victims rather humble and mean
Creature of pain what's up in you
Fellow or anger
Squander your time
Better surrender the deluge of spite
A wish of a broken heart
Fog on the sea
Wistful waiting for the time
Fear arises in me
Can't wait until the end is coming
To say good bye
Close the magic circle
To say good bye
Disasters begin I'm a magical man
Hold the key in my hand
Deep blue something in my eyes
You feel hypnotized
Run if you can
Searching for a reason
Intrude into another world
I'm a man I'm a magical man
Run if you can cause
I'm a magical man
I keep a promise inside of me
That I'll find to the edge of the world
Don't need to believe in prophecies
Follow my vestige neither could help you mys on
Follow me into the future
I'm on the trip to nowhere
Want to escape from the abyss of hell
Watch out out of your window
Can you see me realize
It's just a dream that's my surprise
I'm sinister sinister
Like a dangerous twister
The magical man of your dreams
A dark bloody nightmare
The trip to nowhere
It's not it's not as it seems
Open your eyes
And watch what's happen right ahead
Try to run it's endless time
Sentenced to life convicted to die
Where the path will be shattered
The mirror watching every pace
So stand your ground it's face to face
Ask myself if I could stand
I'm the heir of what is mine
See my views of space and time
Always found a way
Another sunrise and down is fading
You brought me to this place of cold
A voice from beyond I never walked so far
It's time that time should soar
Seasons are changing from joy to agony
Mournful heartbeats blood frozen deep inside me
Memories of childhood return into my head
All senses of sorrow cover my soul
Thunder and lightning attend my destiny
It my time is over what remain of me
Purple haze down in the dark like my name right in your heart
All senses of sorrow until I die
Neverending prayers
Never dying days in the dark
Your day began under the immortal sun of glory
Like demon's eyes a night so crystal and clear
If your time is right for the immortal night have no fear
When I stare out of my window
And gaze at the rain
Vanish in the sands of time
Afraid to reach out for eternity
Downhearted
Downhearted
Vanish in the sands of time
Fall back to my birth
Pressure squeezes my sorrow
Fearful tremble crosses my skin
From the distant dark side
Recover my cloudy mind
Run through the times of history
Often expected the chance of glory
Would hearts for aims in leaders mind
Monstrous offence they left behind
Waste in their eyes if they gonna die
Take you back to the brink of subordinate
Screams of pain reflect in the blade of sword
Waste in their eyes if they gonna die
Take you back to the brink of subordinate
Behave like a god that remains in the end
Strength taste of ammunitions haze
Rejection is written in his face
Can hear women's whispering cry
Ask myself
Am I born to die
What does it look like today with illusion
Hate and contempt to eventual conclusion
Unknown like a star between million specimen
You won't break the walls
I' zooming aimless through the times
Icy winds that once passed by
Forgotten dreams to the union of confusions
They're part of my life and heavy metal
Anthems sound in metal style
The journey ending for a while
For metal fantasies
And the breath of freedom share
Take the rulers everywhere
For metal fantasies
Mystic illusions crossed my way
Anger kisses day by day
Try to catch the light on the horizon
Follow me into my tomb
Ashes to ashes
Did you ever ask yourself
If there is good or bad
Devils grimace smells like sulphur and gas
Your soul drifts away
And you're lost
Dust to dust
In what do we trust
When the sun and the sky blackened
Centuries passed by
Like a bird in flight
To the sorcery of the shadow lands
If there's a god
What would you ask him face to face
Thunder storm and wind in a burning
World of darkness
My frightened face reflected to each other
Confusions will be born
Can't you feel the tears in my heart
Are you take me to heaven
If there's a god
The devil would curse my soul
And the angels of heaven spread their wings
And fight
Feelings crucified
Dark shadows in the night
Did you ever ask yourself
If there is a light
Preparing for the last night
Is there anything true in my life
Emphasizing to be strong
Stand up serious oh so long
Don't find the way out of the darkness
Into a world with a holy light
The innocence is over
See a faceless world inside
Born to live means born to die
Living in a world of destruction and lies
Like a raging tornado in mind
That sometimes enfolds you deny it
Hope is a frame
Interrupts the circle of shame
Can't resist not exist
Everytime it is as it is
Some tears flow down the sea
Turn to ice and disturb me
Reckless and sick tyrannize thoughts
Experience explode  the gun is loaded
The gun is loaded
The gun is loaded
Always on the run
Between darkness moon and sun
That's not the place to be
The hope will follow meWhen I see all that's been
Forgiveness was my greatest sin
So I took a knife to my pity
To the people in black city
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Truth chooses the strangest words
Not the tongue of the common herd
So take a blade let it bleed
Fuck the people in black city
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
Fire Black fire
I was a brazen prince and cold
Now a king on an oaken throne
These dark ages mean nothing to me
For I have forsaken black city
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees
So never bow to any gods
Tame wolves are nothing but dogs
So take a blade let it bleed
To the people in black city
On a course to fight
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
To the heavens we take
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists
The thrill of the kill in the hunters chase
We have exposed the night from which the feeble flee
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Brandish new force like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours
Subservient dogs
Crippled by the pack
Crawling in blind honour
Head down to be shot
Feel the new force like a plague it strikes down
The time is now cos the time is right
To take what is ours
You crawled in the dark
Blind faith broke you down
Face down in submission
Laying down to be shot
This dawn is ours to rise
To cleave a path with a trail of fire
Destruction force to strike
Untarnished blades gripped by clenched fists rise
Clenched fists rise
From the dawn has arisen the hunter
The banishing force the new world dominator
This is retribution
 for all those who died
So come to me all you philosophers
I have a use for all your words
And as for poets and bards
Sycophants to every scar
Burn burn BURN
And as for you lovers of light
You are prisoners on all sides
Burn burn BURN
And as for you humanists
I give the gift of pestilence
Burn burn BURN
This is Tyranny
This is Retribution
 for all those who died
And as for your politics
You march in circles with semantic tricks
Traitors
And as for you occultists
You hide in shadows with your books
And fuck you all religious fools
Your gods your temples your fucking rules
Burn burn BURN
I have no need for pessimism
I believe in Nihilism
Burn burn BURN
Spare none the blade
Spare none the fucking blade
This is Tyranny
This is Retribution
For all those who died
From those who lied
And emperors of golden halls
You built your tomb within your walls
Burn burn BURN
So blessed be the murderers
Who work like wicked conjurers
Thrown into the fire
Spare none the blade
Spare none the fucking blade
Rape the world
God is dead
Praise hail Satan
Cross has dread
Will to power
Victory is one
Satan has rise
Phallus demons break
Jet black fire
Evil they make
Victory is one
Decimation on command
One word  ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK
Decimation on command
One words  ATTACK ATTACK ATTACK
God is dead
World is burning
People die in plague
Victory to the grave
Victory is one
Ride forth sons of perdition
Dominate fuck and destroy
By blood and thunder  rise of the heretics
Satan has won
Stealth it rapes
Black shark takes
Dark war awake
Victory is one
Sons of perdition
Inseminate
Wolf kult religion
Victory is one
Ride forth sons of perdition
Dominate fuck and destroy
By blood and thunder  rise of the heretics
Satan has won
They came to her house in the dead of night
They came to take her
Her mother screamed and her father cried
Let them take her
So the poor little bitch is taken as a witch
To the dungeon
There she is stripped and beaten with a whip
Then they raped her
And she liked it
So this is how you fuck with a crucifix
The poor little bitch well she likes it
So they held her down while they took their turn
They had to break her
Said she was evil and she would burn
Then they raped her
So why does this tale turn you on
Why does it excite you
Cos we are beasts like the beasts in the wild
Or more like barnyard pigs
And you like it
Gather 'round all you firestarters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come sons of Remus
The beast now calls
Wolf sire children
Daughters of Rome  come
Gather 'round all you fire starters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come sons of Remus
The beast now calls
Wolf sire children
Daughters of Rome  come
Come all you mountain lions
Come to our mountain fire
Come and heed the call
We are what you're looking for
Come all you wild wolves
Women with sharpened claws
Come to our mountain fire
We have what you're looking for
Yes you are what we're looking for
Gather 'round all you firestarters
Whirlwind reapers and comet riders
Come to our mountain hall
Come and heed the call
Come all you immoral seizers
Fire starters and whirlwind reapers
To the victor the spoils
As I lay here seduced by the power of my ill begotten gains
Outside  War The ruthless slay
Basking in horrors as my tyranny reigns
But even now I can't resist
Pounding bone with my studded fist
Dawn brings promise but I was cursed at birth
To rule or die like a storm upon this earth
As a mercenary first I came to be
Then the armies hailed and bowed to me
Wolf serpent ritual fire
Blackens the skies like a fucking pyre
Behold my banner kneel to me
Behold my banner my legions see
There's a demon behind these eyes  pitch black eyes
Cruel undead relentless beast
Animal now as always been
For some are born with the curse
The curse of knowing and seeing with pitch black eyes
Wolf serpent ritual fire
Chokes the skies like a blackened pyre
Witch hunter  seeks a scapegoat
Witch hunter  words blow in the wind
Witch hunter  seeks a way out
Witch hunter  know all that is sin
Witch hunter  herald of plagues
Witch hunter  would kill to morality's name
Witch hunter  the virulent keep
The lies of pigs and their fucking disease
There are those who will come to watch you die
To stand around your funeral pyre
And they'll laugh as you're marched to your death
And they dance when the noose is put round your neck
The first to cry and the first to fall
The first to come to the witch hunter's call
The first to curse whatever is free
The first to fight and the first to flee
The first to do whatever is done
The first to sing the witch hunter's song
And yea tho' you walk in the shadow of self
Do not be afraid if you find it is hell
Do not be a slave to just what has been
To make the virtue of demons is the ultimate sin
So fear not my friends for the hour draws near
Better to have lived fast than to die old with fear
Though the old may be wise
No strength to they wield
They envy the young
For by life not death they are killedMad butcher
A fire is burning in his eyes
His brain is in war and the evil will rise
His blood is black it's scalding hot
Now he's got to ramble
He knows that's his lot
Through the Blackstreets of the town
His steps are clanging
Now he's wanton oh he's panting
In his hand a blade of solid steel
Now it's the time you got to feel
Mad butcher
He feels his driving satisfaction he needs
He's watching you pussy he will get his food
And when he arises you think it's a lover
But he likes strange pratices you'll discover
You lie on your bed your view real seems great
But instead of his prick
He's drawing his blade
Oh he's so tender when he makes love to you
That you couldn't stand it
It's a pitty for you
Black visions from the satellite
Sky deaf ears they never get cries
Fat jackals howl at the moon flies
Buzzing playing death's tune
Night ends but the sun it don't rise
Tombs open and the dead they will rise
Black market buys your soul real cheap
No escaping what you sow you will reap
Prisoners of the damned find another land
Planet of the lost land of fire and frost
Prisoners of the dead fear the unknown dread
Tidal waves at sea set the serpents free
Black visions from the satellite sky
Deaf ears they never get cries
Fat jackals howl at the moon flies
Buzzing playing death's tune
Coup d'etat on a global scale
Opposition locked up in jail
Domination the goons are the boss
Human race nailed to a cross
Prisoners of the damned find another land
Planet of the lost land of fire and frost
Prisoners of the dead fear the unknown dread
Tidal waves at sea set the serpents free
Prisoners of the damned find another land
Planet of the lost land of fire and frost
Prisoners of the dead fear the unknown dread
Tidal waves at sea set the serpents free free free free
Every night the same old game
After the show you are looking for something
You're on the road for much too long
Your love has grown between your legs
Don't need a love romance
All you want is something to ride
Princess you wanna open your legs
It is time to show you my way of love
Reject emotions  satisfy your feelings
Victim of lust  trapped in lunatic possession
Reject emotions  too horny to be alone
Reject emotions
Too shy maiden with innocent eyes
No chance for you to strike tonight
They don't realize your game of love
Love is a lie  a wasted business
Inside us are our fears
In torment for our loss
In the silence are our throughts
The Phantoms Cry in unison
Inside me
Infernal
In sadness
I`m buried
Eternal
Sinsation
Inside us are our fears
In torment for our loss
In the silence are our throughts
The Phantoms Cry in unison
The fight within ourselues it seems to be same
To doubt we`re forced to think the same for years
Insolence  inside are your sins
In silence  inside you`re seen
In a way  Inside you`ll sense
In Solace  Inside you`ll see
This is what it is
We`ve swallowed all the lies
Souls descend=fear
This is what we fear
We`ve chosen all the lies
Ignorant and Sincere
Innocence  inside it`s nonsense
In no way  inside you process
In old ways  inside your fears
In Science  The facts are clear
This is what it is
We`ve swallowed all the lies
Souls descend=fear
This is what we fear
We`ve chosen all the lies
Ignorant and Sincere
Into the abyss of sorrow
A thousand deaths of loneliness
Into the night I leave
Enter this world below
Here some have ceased their false hope for true love
fell my last tears
My heart aches for you no more
Into the abyss of sorrow
A thousand deaths of loneliness
Into the night I leave
Enter this world below
So alone before
In the depths of my own sadness it rains
The sky is grey in my mind
Like tears from the void in my heart
My dismay
find the way to ease your mind
for sake of sanity
There is light beyond this emptiness
My hope for happiness
Endless thought keep me up
Night after night my life passed by
Regrets from the past
Thoughts of doom and fears of an end repeat at night
find the way to ease your mind
for sake of sanity
There is light beyond this emptiness
My hope for happiness
We`ve deceived to set them free
for 8 years  Mother`s tears
Strategy or Tragedy
Send our youths to their and
free
How silly
Now see our shame
It all that we see the media they feed
Believe the half truths
Or read in between
Covered in blame
We cause our own shame
fighting a war with insurgents for greed
GREED
In the sea
In the air
In the ground
fair warfare
Careless Bombings where there`s families
The civlians are the main casualties
Where is the media coverage It`s weak
Inside I fear the enemy is me
Hauntings
Are they dreams
Nightmares
So they seem
father`s soul lingers
In the light you must go in
Restless Spirits in a realm of two worlds in between
father can you see the lights The energy
Enter the gate
Your farthest descent was your mental demise
Your father`s prayer in the night
Buried
In our sight  flames
Bitter Soul
Blamed
Hate
In our sight  flames
Your buried and our soul is in flames
Hate  fate
Diseased  All you fools
Pray to your god
Deceived by the tales  Invented
Live by the words made by man
Serve the false god  Simpletons
Filled with false hope and fantasies
Believe in the Saints 
Senseless stories
Unanswered prayers
Beliefs of deceit
Depressed anxiety
Subconsciously you sense
The doubts of all shall know
Your faithfulness fades
Believe in ancient fables
Your consciences lie in ancient beliefs
Diseased  All you fools
Pray to your god
Deceived by the tales  Invented
Live by the words made by man
Serve the false god  Simpletons
Filled with false hope and fantasies
Believe in the Saints 
Senseless stories
Unanswered prayers
Beliefs of deceit
Thousands have died on the path
Marched from Marveles on The Bataan
Soldiers malnovrished and weak
for 6 days their covrage has peaked
fallen and Beaten they try their hardest to stay alive
Watching your comrades now die
You fate is not yours to decide
If others say our war is our shame
We`re now the enemy
Why are we hear
If others say this war helped save a nation that is now free
Why keep us here
Into the march of insanity
Thousands of soldiers lost lives
Abandoned by our own goverment
Serving a nation of lies
Where was the rescue as we wait for death
Discovraged your faith you deny
The final breath of the soldier is now
We are running out of time
It's time to die 
Death stands behind the door 
Satan sends his warriors 
Demons break out of Hell 
Shrill cries 
Angel dies 
Shrill cries 
Outbreak of evil 
With swords and axes 
The fight hard 
In a massacre 
they feel the hot smart 
None can survive 
People will destroy 
Souls like hell 
Where demons make a toy
Hear my last words
My final tragedy
I bid you farewell
for my words will live on
My music plays on
But now I am gone
frightened and alone
Tales of sandess
Hear the cries
Grey Mourning
Alone in my own mind
fear the empty within
But my life will go on
So we must move on
Please let the past go
frightened and alone
Tales of sandess
Hear the cries
Grey Mourning
All my hopelessness has truly gone away
My thoughts are like enemies
My mind betrays me
I can no longer say I`m alone and cold
Don`t care for your fairy tales
Please don`t
So save your prayers
Keep your book
There`s nothing you can do
My mind is not closed but I`m free to choose
I`ll miss you for nothing can save me now
Thank you for all the memoriesSmiley happy faces
A hurt filled heart denied
Who cares about the person
If they look good from outside
Ignore my emotions
Let them eat away inside
Nothing left to live for
But at least I kept my pride
Can you ignore love
Can you endure hate
Can you live a lie
Deny the loneliness and pain
Can you hate yourself
Attain a darker shade
Blindly paint your mask
And come and join the masquerade
A childhood fear a trauma
Oppressed emotions grow
Tangled deep within
A time bomb waiting to explode
The oppressed becomes oppressor
Aggression now unleashed
Thus starts the vicious circle
But the anguish could be peace
There tsands your father
Crying at the pain
The perfect answer
Not an object for the blame
The hate the fear the pain the tears the lies
See through your mind your pain filled eyes
Washed in the blood your anguish dies
Your mind set free
Go out and live again
Why when I'm feeling down do you seem so far away
Surrounded by love but alone inside my head
Why when things go wrong do I run away and hide
Life goes on but I've been left behind
Oh reach out and touch me
Show me that you're there show me hat you care
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But I'd never be alone you would always guide me home
Then why do I feel so alone
Why do I do the things I hate to do The things I know I want to do
I cannot do even for you I know you want me to
It's not me but that within me that has taken control of me
When will be the day you take this wretched man and set him free
I know you see
'Tis I that turn away from thee
You're here for me
But there's a door I hold the key
Selfish despair the thing that binds me hurting all of those around me
Hurting you the one who saved me stops your light from shining from me
Give me back the fire that burned in me and help me be how I want to be
And help me hate the enemy he got too close to me
Don't follow me follow the one I follow
Don't look to me look to the one I look to
Don't turn away because of the believers
The true one is the Christ and not the Christians
Bleach my mind all hope inside
A path I walked misguided
Gave my life all understanding
To find a way one sided
A whirlwind of anger to be unleashed
A mind carved twisted by all
To make my own decisions is unheard of
I am nothing at all
My distorted view once force fed
My will was broken my life led
Caring not for what mattered to me
Confused and lost bound and free
Unbalanced I toss to and fro
Where will it end and what will I find
I am but a prisoner on whom can I call
From where I find the key sullen I fall
But to find it all to settle my daze
I must first find a way through the maze
Clearly I see what was so unseen
I won't return to where I have been
The way is paved marked with gold
I have someone to trust someone to hold
My fears and confusion my troubled soul
Embraced by Jesus my life made whole
Man is not master of his own destiny
But only of destruction
From each word each thought each deed
He must reap what has been sown
There is but one true God
I see those gross atrocities
I mourn those needless deaths I see
Outrage grips my soul their pain plays on my mind
But then I can get back to life and leave it all behind
Numbered emotions a teardrop dries away
A memory the residue that's safely kept at bay
Lord open my mind open my soul see the reality
Come take my emotions turn into actions remove the apathy
Death seen as solution blind aggression insensitivity
Let peace begin with me
I blame them they probably blame me
Deluded by security
Our actions may be raindrops together they're a flood
Maybe though our ignorance our own hands stained with blood
Selfpreoccupation selfishness the knife
Man has mastered killing but he never will give life
Words they told me the words to say
They taught me the way to play
Not 'til now I know
Feel the way I want to be free
But how can it be so real
When I'm feeling so low
So reach out and touch me show me that you're there
Teach me how to feel you whisper that you care
I know that you're my shelter my strength my need my all
So why's it when I'm feeling down I can't feel you at all
Touch me in a way that I'll know that it is you
Hold me and embrace me make me something new
Fill me with your laughter your life your gifts your all
Pull me up I'm in selfbound so numb but soon not any more
You gave me life gave me hope gave me resurrection
You give your peace give your all
The love in those eyes I see
The trusting nature they call naivete
A peace with all to me so unattainable
So far advanced to the world that surrounds them
So much to teach the fools who mock them
Looked upon as subhumanity
Just for pity and charity
Ease my conscience but please keep them out of view
No right to live even before life
Too big a burden prepare the knife
Maybe the world's the one that's mentally disabled
Grouped together in modern day asylums
No dignity as we force our views upon them
The love in those eyes I see
Not reflected by humanity
A childish fear of those who are different
The vilest prejudice society's accepted
All they have to give blindly rejected
Incessant bleeding brutal afflictions
Crimson crown poisoned oppressions
Disfigured body contemplates death
Love the reason every breath
The candle burns the end nears
As thirst for life disappears
Sardonic anthem harmony of scorn
The crucifixion cord of death torn
Salvation unseen by naive minds
Separation the darkness binds
For mankind his last breath
If but for one suffering death
All aboard that's coming
Farewell to them that ain't
It's time for me to see the world
It's getting late
So I'll say farewell to Bristol and goodbye to Nailsea
And we'll let this Brummy come aboard 'coz he's good company
So why don't thee take a risk and come along with me
It may be rough but at the end we all will merry be
Skipper where we going
A better place sez He
You're just goin' nowhere fast
And so was we
The time'll come yer cider jar's as empty as yer head
And we'll be out at open sea with better things ahead
You don't believe in paradise after all we've said
Maybe I'll lose me breakfast if I stay I'll lose me head
All hands around the capstan
Time to earn yer keep
The skipper says the wind is right
So walk and heave
We'll sing a song of where we're goin' and of where we've been
And we'll sing of them we left behind and them we're gonna meet
I'm sorry but I won't be back to tell thee what I've seen
But I know that all you'll see's the grass grow 'neath your feet
Farewell to merry England
The place that I've called home
Goodbye to those who've missed the boat
You're on your own
I'll think of them that tried to swim and them that tried to row
And tell them that's waiting on the dock for another ship to go
There's them that' happy left behind in ye Llendoger Trow
They won't be when they realise they've missed the last ship home
This deeply furrowed brow
Has seen the end of many years
Lines of laughter and of sorrow
This face was washed by many tears
I have lived a full life
Made my fair share of mistakes
I'm ready now to leave for home
But listen as my spirit waits
Listen to me child
I won't always be there
I've said all I can say
You must search alone
I know I've let you down
But He will never leave you
Just reach out your hand
He will lead you home
As my senescent body groans
To be relieved of mortal pain
Please don't cry for me
My time has come to live again
I'll pray that you will feel the Spirit
And remember words I've said
For I know that I'll live on
Even when my body's dead
Listen to me child
Why can't you see
What it means to me
Listen to me child
Cool to be high in the sky flying
Smashed on the pavement you're bleeding and dying
The press have their story the dealers their money
Parents and friends are crying it's too late for words
It's too late for words
Evil desires twisted path bloody glory
Breaking his heart tear reddened eyes He does see us through
The father sighs his love is denied his love defied
For Him it is won share in the victory
A trip so wild and near
A trip of love for us all to share
For I have been there among the flower walls
Among the voices of liars and the Devil's calls
Creeping down the tunnel of doom where Hell awaited
Led into a darkness a prison I have created
Craving for my life to be a tortured eternity
Defying my calls on my last grains of sanity
Yes I have been there but I am still here
A vision of beauty pierced through my torture
Not even a call but a question was answered
A living dream a painted reality
My father has saved me from unbearable loss
The trip I'm now on secured by the cross
I feel you gently as the wind blows
See you as the grass grows
Know you as it rains
I'm near you sitting in the moonlight
You touch em when the sun's bright
No two hills the same
I hear you softly as the bird sings
You're fresh me with the pure spring
You feed me with the land
I see your beauty in the flowers
Your strength as it thunders
Your vastness in the sand
I see you in autumn as the leaves fall
I wonder as a child crawls
In springtime the lambs
I marvel in winter as the lakes freeze
In summer with the cool breeze
All move with your hand
I see your might as the wave breaks
Fear you as the earth quakes
Love you in the fields
I bathe in your presence in the mountains
Your beauty as it transcends
Everything I feel
Guardians fail
Our world is neglected destroyed
Love is denied
Creation's emotions are toyed
Creed prevails
The money that blinds thoughtful eyes
Progress they say
A gradual worldwide suicide
Silently I wait the tears to fall
Forlorn entity none to all
Vale of anguish fragrant solitude
Bathed in sadness sorrows interlude
There is no black no white no grey
There is no light no dark no dusk
Only subtle shades of pastels
A distant choir a subtle melody
Fading perfume haunting memory
Like stars fell in the snow
Eternal fires no longer glow
There is no black
Only subtle shades of pastels
Silently I wait the tears to fallWe are now living on the nuclear age
This world once ours is now our deadly cage
We've pushed ourselves so far now there's no turning back
Existence will end at the next nuclear attack
Massive devastation 
Mankind has sealed his fate
Massive devastation
No remorse it's now too late
Who'll see heaven who'll feel hell
The decisions ours only time will tell
Our lives are lead by our own decision
We're victims of our own freewill
Ignorant people who try to hide
Keep the truth in the back of their mind
They know their fate but are afraid to face it
Taking their lives for granted They don't want to die
Massive devastation 
Mankind has sealed his fate
Massive devastation
No remorse it's now too late
The sky turns black the sun explodes
People are frying on the roads
The earth is burnt to the crust
Bodies are instantly turning to dust
Now is the time the last battles come
The war is over and nobody won
No lives were spared every soul was lost
This is the end it's the final holocaust
Massive devastation
It's total annihilation
Massive devastation
The end of our creation
Here me now these words of creed
Your mind and body are what I need
For I can give you the key to be free
Don't listen to his blasphemy
They gather in masses to praise the one
No lives will be spared when he's done
Death is certain in their eyes
Ignore their pleas and their cries
Give to me your destiny
Hatred and deceit
For you are the chosen ones and I will set you free
Your head is filled with fear
You know that death is near
Don't you try to flee
Your soul now belongs to me
Another day Another soul
I'll take your life and gain control
Death's deception growing near
Corruption of your brain is here
Taking your mind they fill it
Taking your life and kil it
Twisting your dreams into lies
Controlling your mind whenever
Changing your life forever
You'll never escape them never
Putting your world in sin
Evil lurks within
Their deadly lessons begin
Killing you with their madness
Leaving a trail of sadness
Death is the only way out
You must die by their hand tonight
Leading you to your grave
You know you can't be saved
Don't even try to escape
Death hides in many places
Striking terror on the faces
Of those who seek their revenge
Killing for their rights
Your death is their despise
An ultimate goal of corruption
The battle's never won
These maniacs have just begun
Spreading they syndrome of terror throughout
You must die by my hand tonight
Condemned to die
Destiny for them was planned
A violent leader pledged to kill
A race thought insuperior
Lead to the slaughter of millions
Camps of death formed throughout the land
Killing of innocent people due to one man's hand
Submitted them into the furnace
They were left to die
Devastating slaying of people
But do we understand why
Now that the lives are lost
Will we learn from the mistake
Or shall we many more perish
Receiving such and unjust fate
Dying taking their lives as the people stand 
and watch their children burn in flames
Crying screaming out in agony as the chosen ones 
are sented sentenced to a lifelong early grave
Pressure building up inside your head
You can't deal with the agony of life
Unable to handle the problems that you face
So you turn to an alternative escape
Usage of substances that now controlling you
Deteriorating your mind and your body too
Internal acceptance of a critical reply
A tragic destiny lies waiting you
Death is calling
But your ignoring
Your mind is falling
Into the unknown
It's life you seek
But your too weak
Addicted now
You've let drugs control your life
Point of inception will this be your last
You've forgotten all the hell you went through in the past
Easy is the answer false is the way
Artificial relief no permanent escape
Signals from hell appearing in your mind
Deadly message warning it's your time
Blaming your problems theres just no excuse
Now you are dead from this abuse
Death is calling
But your ignoring
Your mind is falling
Into the unknown
It's life you seek
But your too weak
Addicted now
You've let drugs control your life
Now the time for you to die
Loss of reality nothing here is real
Pleasure turns pain as you begin to kill
Accidental murder you are going away
Revenge is certain you are going to pay
Living your life like theres no tomorrow
Caught up on this world of sin
Every single day just beg and borrow
Playing a game that you just can't win
Constructing your life you manipulate
Planning your will make your escape
Nothing is certain for you but death
Now's the time to put you at your rest
Death is here at last
Now there's no second chance
Looking him eye to eye
Now is your time to die
MEET YOUR MAKER
Though you though you would never se
Your final day happening
No time no escape just indecision
Unable to relieve yourself from this position
While on earth you killed and maimed
Life to you was just a game
Your now the victim as I see
The final verdict will be by me
Death is here at last
Now there's no second chance
Looking him eye to eye
Now is your time to die
MEET YOUR MAKER
The verdict has just been passed
Can't you see your dying fast
Your bodys going to rot in hell
And there's no saving you now
Fighting the feeling of torment
That dwells within your brain
Locked up in this padded cell
They've labeled you insane
Our world is nothing more to you
Than a game of life and death
Seeking pleasure as you watch
Your victim's die slow death
Insanity what's in your head
We now see that your brain is dead
Demented mind ruling over you
Now there's nothing left to do
Killed and killed again
But that's your twisted way
Menace to the normal view
But in this in this cell you'll stay
There is no escape for you
This torture must go on
For this is the price you pay
For a violent crime so wrong
Feeling your leaving your world behind
Body being ruled by an empty mind
Your living is sanity
Death is your final plea
Probing intrusions
Deep within your brain
Try to find the reason why
You've gone insane
No answer to your problem
Your just meant to be
A victim of society
Only death will set you free
Insanity what's in your head
We now see that your brain is dead
Demented mind ruling over you
Now there's nothing left to do
Feeling your leaving your world behind
Body being ruled by an empty mind
Your living is sanity
Death is your final plea
Looking for eternity
Of life through the word of God
Innocent people are taken in
While others just choose to ignore
Saying they can heal you just by the touch of their hand
Sitting back they're getting rich spreading their disease all over the land
Leading you but not the right way
Once they've got your mind
They'll cast you astray
Fame and fortune are all that they seek
Raping your mind as they're destroying the weak
Caught up in a false occult
Where religion can be blind
The words of God are twisted now
And fed into your mind
You're give your life to save your soul
The chosen one now takes control
Satan's your savior he's your master
Perish in flames as your burning faster
Leading you but not the right way
Once they've got your mind they'll cast you astray
Fame and fortune is all that they seek
Raping your mind they're destroying the weak
Acts of vengeance
Cause of violence
Intentional
Suicide and pain
The termination of thousands strapped to their chest
Warriors of terror  Society's pestilence
Attacking the innocent  For the mortal cause
As governments crumble into the blood stained streets
Explosion
Ripping ears apart
Bodies
Fragments of once was a man
Blood begins to boil as the air burns the lungs
Screams of torment penetrate the dust
Twisted bones are mangled debris of extinguished life
Why are the leaders ignoring their cries
Violence Vengeance People spreading terror at will
Death Hatred Agony of what we're living in
Cries Lies who can you trust now
Terror
Evil in their lies
Torment
Living in hell
Annihilation present as they seek their revenge
Innocent are dying  the killing never ends
Subjugation of the weak with no lives to spare
Existence is dying but do we even care
Destruction
Of mankind
Holocaust
All are dying
Man's killing himself not worrying about the price
Of eternal doom we don't want to die
Time has come for us to make our final stand
And stop the corruption of death throughout the land
Watchers of the paths apostles
Woeful fiends of night
Come inside my flaming wound
As day fades into dark
Ride with me scorns of blackness
On the wings of death
Bear my name seal my blood
Turn against the light
Hear them calling from the underworld
They call for me
Hear them calling from the underworld
Warders of my destiny
Infernal soldiers of my past
Come inside my flaming wound
As day fades into night
Ride with me sons of thunder
On the wings of death
Bear my name seal my fate
Turn against the light
We watched the sun set for the last time
Blinding us with its glory
Dead angels fell from grace departed into nothingness
Life had ended leaving us empty waiting for another dawn
Darkness embraced us with new life and death began to form
Perished in flames our souls will rise
Above his dead world above his creation
We will forever stand eternal as the dark gods we are
Heavenly god kneel before us
Exposing no face left in disgrace
Death is our kingdom we welcome thee in
We will rule this earth again past has come to its disclosure
Unite us adore us
We are the only ones for you
Ancient Ones Elder Ones make our offering
Burn together with our sleeping souls
Come rain come fire bring thy wrath down on me
In the shadows of night I lie hidden away from thee
Let thy life fade away
Feel thy soul fall astray
Into oblivion come and die with me
Alone in my keep alone in my dreams reality
I forge my destiny I wait for the grave to ruin my sanity
Carving deeper and deeper each day
My flesh it seems so strange
Lost in my world of beliefs and fantasies
Tempting me with it's burning eyes
Let's be one let's walk together embrace me with thy cold
hmm I'm only losing my skin
Emptiness my true love
Forever by my side
We ride the winds of death together
As it always has been
I'm longing for your cold embrace
You whisper in my ear
Come to me
I am the only one my love
Can't you see
We have been together since the dawn of time
Forever we will be
Call my name I'll be there
Just for you
I'll be waiting all alone
Just for you
Emptiness my true love
Close and by my side
We will stand eternal forever
As we always has done
I know you're longing too
You whisper in my ear
Come to me
I am the only one my love
Can't you see
We have been together since the dawn of time
Forever we will be'as one
Sleep with me
Join my dream
Stay at my side
Come closer
Whisper in my ear
Stay at my side
I am so cold
Please never leave
Stay at my side
Love me forever
Ever and ever
Stay at my side
My dying dream
How beautiful you seem
Wipes away my tears
Removes all my fears
Farewell
From the dark dismayed
I crave what can't be craved
I have become what needs to be
Licking my own flames
Feel my life running through your veins
All bitter but truly divine
A former shadow that purified
Into blackness infernal pride
Blood red tears crimson eyes
The cursed face that hypnotize
I am He the fear of man
Highest god the scorn Divine
Be my mistress triumph with me in sin
I am the scorn Divine
Shadows extending
Divinity falling deeper than death
My flaming poison will be your spawn
Feel my life running through your veins
All bitter but truly divine
A former shadow that purified
Into blackness infernal pride
Call forth the Ones of air
Call forth the Ones of earth
Call forth your own death
Call forth the Ones of water
Call forth the Ones of fire
Call forth your own poisonous death
All dressed in shadows
The whore awaits the night
Creeping through the graves of filth and lust
Sunlight decays moonlight heals
Welcome to sinners paradise
The whore all dressed in white
Longing for her lovers bite
Come on in my precious fiend
Unite with me in ecstasy
Explore my flesh enter my womb
Taste the food of the gods
Welcome to sinners paradise
Where dreams and decadence will revive
This is our paradise
Where purity and moral dies
Garden of delight Eden of sin
Essence of evil from within
Along with her shadows
The whore awaits the night
Welcome to sinners paradise
Welcome to sinners paradise
Where dreams and decadence will revive
This is our paradise
Where impurity and immoral never dies
So beautiful
Your dreams of me
I'm the answers to all your pain
I'm your savior dare you die without me
We are so close
Only an edge between
I will embrace you
A magic still to be born
Can you live without me
Can you sleep without me
Can you die without me
I'm your savior
Can you live without me
Can you sleep without me
Can you die without me
I'm your angel
From the grave I'm starting to remember
All that lies you told me
The broken promises all falseness and deceits
All those things are suddenly clear I'm waking up again
I see your face in front of mine and I will never forgive you
Can't you see I'm out of pain you can't hurt me anymore
My inner demons are all angels taking care of me
In my dreams my fears still haunts me but they lost control
They all smile death has found its way they have lost control
I am home buried deep
I found home down below
Heavens angels stopped to pray my soul is ever lost
I found my sanctum here on earth a few feet down below
Heavens angels sings no more I found my home
All the beauty you possessed all the things that you once were
It has died it's buried deep inside my burning heart
Nothing remains the same I am waking up again
Your face has started to fade but I will never forgive youAncient witchery an evil sorcerer
Supernatural powers brings life's death
The devil's cohort a chilling specter
She is a shadow that is out for blood
Beautiful deadly she's the night
Practices of black infanticide
Orgies of unearthly acts
Is the nightmare of the human mind
A goddess figure a divine force
Ritual incantations brought forth
Possess powers of divination
A mortal vision of the forbidden
Soars to nocturnal gatherings
Face to face with Satan's sister
Worship the ensemble of the witch
Lucifer appears to partake in lust
For those who condemn evil
The would torture to confession
Found guilty of witchcraft
Burn Witch
Burn Witch
Burn Witch
Burn to fucking Death
Jaws of death hammering down
Killing is the way i live
Seriously taking life regrets
Doing Satan's will at best
Fuck God
Fuck Christ
Hoathe Satani
The slaughters have not been found
Until they find the dead i killed
I defeat God and make my own
Spend eternity in hell
Prepare for the great battle
Watch his weak children die
To serve in heaven no longer
Leaving victims for dead
One crushed with deadly force
One beaten with blunt trauma
One hung gutted from within
Deserve to die for their ways
Dont need to live another day
Once gone forever forgotten
Left for dead begin to rotten
He came back to have his way
Life or death a trade with evil
On a path of destruction
Innocent people gone forever
Met a mad man out for pleasureCold all white science bare white slave all over
Worship fixed in circles white floor glass ceiling painted
Nails fall white essence wrinkles stitched together
Minions blind miracles white eyes stare only fainted
One last day in Rome like a white dove in hell
Falling stars silent wishes merely broken shells
Swing low swing low
When stitched and sewn all over
Go down go down
White scars unseen as ever
Gone to white presence seam white sewn unover
Last rose given never white thick oily scent departed
Preach to white silence dry mouth foams just slower
Worship cold bandages white moist air rainbow coloured
The rain is thrumming on
Windows soak the tears
I am so alone without her here
The rain is thrumming on
Downwardburning flame
Don't want her to know
Heaven wept again
The rain is thrumming on
Dark rivers that sear
I would want her to know
How I miss her here
I am haunted by her voice
By her eyes and by her touch
Still feeling her voracious love
Though she's gone and out of reach
Dark rivers of the heart
Take this down ca 1993
Grey dusk envelops the dying stream
Failing yet holding sway
Slowly going away
Grind me down into the ground
Down again when I drown
I've failed again
Absinthe always this way
Absinthe my loveless angel
Shaking nervously with intenser days
The pissant drags a bloody soul away
Building beds out of flesh
Rotting time an empty caress
Grind me down into the ground
Down again when I drown
I've failed again
Absinthe always this way
Absinthe my loveless angel
A long way to go when chained to the earth
Yesterday was mourning today's a brighter dirge
Rose die with me fruits embitter and swans drown
Summer came and passed away without a sound
But it's over now and what can I do
Dark are the days now all year through
Can you hear the silence
Can you feel the thorns
Can you feel the silence
Can you hear the storms
Oh you were sad then in a time long gone
Not with you I drifted off into dead zones
And you were sick back when chasing those fears
Needed me close and still I wasn't there
Can you hear the silence
Can you feel the thorns
Can you feel the silence
Can you hear the storms
We fade away
Oh cotton girl you wind up
The sun and moon and stars
You kiss the deep night goodbye
Heal my wounds clean my scars
You infuse a deeper meaning
New colours and hues
You're my girl on heaven hill
God's talent put to use
All I needed to be free
All I wanted for us two
To hear you say the words I do
All I needed to be free
All I wanted to be with you
Yesmine you're never mine
Yesmine always on my mind
Oh cotton girl you draw away
Dark nights and cold lives
You take me to the boulevards
Where the rich meet to die
You exhude spiritual guidance
Blue notes for my soul
You enlight meanings hidden
With your passion and glow
All I needed to be free
All I wanted for us two
To hear you say the words I do
All I needed to be free
All I wanted to be with you
Yesmine you're never mine
Yesmine always on my mind
With her lion winter it is always spring
Hotel beds and hot windy summer mornings
We'll say yes to coming seasons growth and change
I was chocked by the voracious springtime rain
You take away the pain
In your eyes I see eternal summer
In our world there'll be eternal summer
Hand in hand we met love in the apocalypse
Rhythmically lulled asleep she bit her lip
And said when we made love on wedding day
did you feel this is for always for always
You take away the pain
In your eyes I see eternal summer
In our world there'll be eternal summer
When the rain was over
Naked world uncovered
For once the sky was blue
And all I ever wanted was you
You strangle me so gently I choke on your hold
Your beautiful hands all over my soul
I try to forget but you are so whole
Like a star of heaven you shine alone
If I could only hear yo say perhaps my name
My world would never ever be the same
If I could only see you eyes smell your dark chestnut hair
Until I can hardly see I feel that you're here
You drive the needle you shoot up my soul
You drive the needle in a world of gold
You drive the needle
I'm washing away but the pain still shows
I'm hurting inside but the pain still grows
The memory of you makes my day feel old
A long time ago I was too cold
Call your coroners girl I'd die for your smile
If need could be reasoned with emotions would die
But I see through the darkness a light to my eyes
You are the spiritfire on an earth of ice
You drive the needle you shoot up my soul
You drive the needle in a world of gold
You drive the needle you shoot up soul
You couldn't cut me deeper with a knife if you tried
The burden of tomorrow makes me run off and hide
You stripped me off my skin let me know love I come
Glasscat lioness now what have we done
You and me we're in love with a lie
Morphine morphine
You and me again that's why
Morphine morphine
With plastic happiness comes the laughing emptiness
We've always been forgetting these magic recipes
You stripped me off my skin let me know love I come
Glasscat lioness now what have we done
You and me we're in love with a lie
Morphine morphine
You and me again that's why
Morphine morphine
Putting on my oblivious helmet pretending I am dead
Trying again to sleep your words out of my head
Scratch not the surface deep beneath the feelings lie
Reasons only reasons that can't be justified
Sometimes somewhere someday
Out there so far away for you
I'll be waiting I'll be waiting
3 am a warming rain
I saw your cheeks red with springtime fires
Visualizing you all the time again
When you were making faces in the river
You build me up when I'm torn down
I'll try to forget when I'm under ground
But you got the cure for me the cure I need
Here it comes again I am overwhelmed
These days are crazy her weather is magic
Sometimes somewhere someday
Out t here so far away for you
I'll be waiting I'll be waiting
3 am a warming rain
I saw you your vivid eyes and spirit glow
Visualizing you all the time again
When you were making angels in the snow
An angel with coal painted feathers washed ashore
An angel that needn't be cleansed anymore
All the earth and air with out substance smeared
On days passed heaven overflowed
Now with a thousand clouds covered
In the broad white dawn
All the lights so strangely float
From rainbow fallen in the glowworm's light
Under the bodies of dew we were still
It's all so clear like silver from gold
Once this was our will
Silver like the ebb and tide gone by
Silver the farewells and goodbyes
This is for the stillness of empty days
For the nevers and the always
Like the sorceress in you in the light of these thoughts
We'd stay till we ran out of fears
You gave me a world of reasons to endure
And once we were here
She is burnt so badly by the flames from her heart
Devil dancing on our souls to keep up part
For the bridges we burnt for the dreams that died
We cry we pray
She is burnt so badly by the flames from her heart
Devil dancing on our souls to keep up part
For the days we lost for the times we missed
We cry we pray
With her nothing's quite what it seems
It feels like we were part of the same dream dream of
Deep deep love and deep deep wounds
The deeper the love the deeper the wounds
She is burnt so badly by the flames from her heart
Devil dancing on our souls to keep us part
For our song unsung for our lives undone
We cry we pray
With her nothing's quite what it seems
It feels like we were par of the same dream dream of
Deep deep love and deep deep wounds
The deeper the love the deeper the woundsTo live is to die the last hope burned down to dust
Out of mind but without any fear waiting for the end now
On our way to downfall thoughts drifting in the sea of passion
I had read the book of life and it killed me
Hate for your lies burns in my heart
Why does falseness always have to win
I wanna unfold my soul
Don't wanna be imprisoned by you
My comfort my death will be yours as well
Face to face with death we are all the same
Lost in visions I all hope fades out
What remains is just a high
Sometimes I fear to wake
Sometimes I fear the next day
Ill humour seems to crush me
Agonising pain stronger than the ideal
Sometimes I fear that nobody stands up
Sometimes I fear that nobody defends himself
Sometimes I fear to be restless for all eternity and
Sometimes I fear that my fear gets lost
What has happened with you
Did your emotions go away
Your life
Just a hunt for bucks
But you've been running behind the life
in vain
You've been kicking the beaten ones as winner
Like others have already done it before
Famine  The soul of mankind
Pestilence  The plague of mankind
War  The horror of mankind
Death  The best for mankind
Recompense for your wasted time
Result of your sins
Don't beg for mercy
Your last chance is gone
The time has come for
The march of revenge
You demand humanity but you are inhuman
You demand justice but you are unjust
You demand love but you kill
You want to protect but you destroy
Don't beg for mercy
Your last chance has gone
The time has come for
The march of revenge
We judge cause we are judges
We destroy cause we create
We create cause we destroy
We like to see you suffer
We the guardians of this planet
Defeated in the game of violence screams just dying away
Defeated in the game of the Teutons tears accompanying their power
Defeated in the game of lies the scum feigning you sterile love
Defeated in the game of fate defeated in the game of violence
The game of violence deadly silence
Irony of life you are playing human in vain
Irony of madness superior cultures death adorning its traces
Irony of the game the lust while killing lasts unsatisfied
Irony of violence your rage your hate your mental agony
Proud 'n free like will of steel
Our hearts are as pure as the silence of a night
We are brothers of METAL united in fight
'Cause METAL is our law
Heavy Metal is our law
We are proud and standing tall
Heavy Metal is what we feel
Harder than steel
Can you feel the power of this song
The energy it is giving you
Brothers united in mind
'Cause Metal is our law
HEAVY METAL
HEAVY METAL is our law
We are proud and standing tall
HEAVY METAL is what we feel
Harder than steel
Our life belongs to Heavy Metal
Our fight applies to its enemies
We'll fight for our right
To live like we want
HEAVY METAL
Listen to your hearts they don't defraud you
This shall be our fighting song
Even the world is black and hope gets lost
We'll stand together until the end of time
HEAVY METAL is our law
We are proud and standing tall
HEAVY METAL is what we feel
Harder than steel
I dance every morning till the sun goes down
I laugh loud as long the world turns round
The end draws near every evening day by day
Come dance with me it is too late
The world is black it's the way it should be
There's not much time left to shoe emotions
And so we dance joyfully into the end
Come with me I'm prepared
And laughing we dance into the darkness
Life is seldom beautiful
Be patient one day you will comprehend
Everyday humanity dies
To love somebody there's not much time
New born megalomanice to possess
To rule is to blame
Destroyed what once burned so great and glorious inside me
The fire that never seemed to fade
The life took me every sense
Unimportant all those years of striving for perfect glory
The flame once burning so great and glorious turned me into stone
Love turned into hate hope into pain
You shall perish you who took my dreams
You shall die 1000 years my hate is blind
Everything is clear now
Our aim is fixed in our hearts
If you know the way
Nobody is in the mood to stop you
Don't demean yourself
You've chosen the light
And not the pain
So just live and fight
    No questions no fear
The solution is near
Much you've got to learn
And great power you will earn
Delight and fortune
Easy to get
For the one who's finished
With dependence on fate
The smell of death is in the air
And dead bodies I see everywhere
Just machine people all our hope is lost
The courage the pride the souls have these costs
You never learned to think
And your ship will sink
I try to see a sign of hope in your eyes
But I just see decay and lies
Is love pain
Fortune paralysed by fear
The quest of deepest darkness
Although the creature strives for the light
Love depraved mysterium  revelation
Are we falling into the most tremendous of all storms
Can eternity only mitigate
The crown of creation rose to rule to be subject
The beast has left us
Gaja will be the judge
Love depraved mysterium  Revelation  Downfall
Love depraved mysterium  Revelation  Downfall
The day will come and nothing will be heard That`s the great silence This
will be the day of retribution for all the pain and injuries the mankind has
caused to our mother earth and at the same time the day of deliverance of
the earth and of all suffering souls All will be silence Not a single human
voice no human being conceited about it's ability to speak can make a
single noise It seems that the Creation swallows the dull routine of everyday
life to get attention for the imminent apocalypse at hand The biggest
machines and factories built from human hands are quiet dead and
insignificant And nature all living creatures all the growing and blooming
things the water and the air will be silent But not dead Deep inside the
Creation a noise is growing which has never been heard before born of the
the pain and the suffering of every living creature One can not hear it but
you can feel it in your bones and the whole world is shaking because of it
Penetrating and it rises up to a river of screaming draughning everyone and
everything Nothing will be left and in the end there will be a great silence
and eternal peaceTo live is to die the last hope burned down to dust

Now they rise again to rape us reversed
Bone crusher
You that sleep in mud
Bone crusher
Smell their unholy blood 
Careless carcass
Soulless being
Nameless pervert
Cynic rapist
From the abyss of eternal affliction a compelling creature awakens  fresh from the dead
Spawned to kill sent to murder on the marshes of humanity 
Hate them
Prepare your grinder  for the final attack
Wait In anger  until mankind is exposed
Sharpen your blades  they shall slice them from all flesh
Damn damn damn them
Bone crusher
You that sleep in the mud
Bone crusher
Smell their unholy blood 
Laughing at your victims  as your crush them alive
Impaling their bodies  on sticks of flames and wire
Skinning their flesh  as pigs you slaughter them all
The rest you eat  and spitting out the teeth 
Bone crusher
You that sleep in the mud
Bone crusher
Smell their unholy blood 
Careless carcass
Soulless being
Nameless pervert
Cynic rapist
It is the year of ultimate darkness
Where all shall expire in fear
Pain is on the way  suffering from today
Torment we all are feeling
Persistent Pain puts you on the edge of sanity 
As the world begins to rot
A destructive scheme of brutality 
From your societies control sick top 
Marching from the north step by step they change the world
The sky is thick with smoke from their cyclone technology
The snow is black falling from above in wet chunky balls
We shall die we shall die we shall die 
Now you wander out in the night as the rest
Spitting out your guts to put you to the test
Nothing will remain in your thoughtless shell
Forever a creature in your own incarnated hell
A legion of brainwashed minions will strain you to your bed
Barbwire cuts your skin as the plunger hits your brain
You hold your breath in pain when reality begins to fade
A zombie of society as they put your soul in chains 
It is the year of ultimate darkness
Where all shall expire in fear
Pain is on the way  suffering from today
Torment we all are feeling
Poison in the veins of all that lives
Time has come for all that is
Obliteration in 7 stages 
Final touch  Life Eraser
Bleeding in the gutters of the underworld
No skin on flesh  your cries not heard
No blood in veins just white washed brains
Stoned beyond imagination  No soul in eye
Carving into life of the mankind souls
Abominations cynic as ice is cold
Incineration in 7 stages
Final touch  Life eraser
The world is doomed in the seconds to come
The clash of wars draws closer
War machines killing tens of millions
Blood tsunamis drowning the rest
Poison in the veins of all that lives
Time has come for all that is
Obliteration in 7 stages 
Final touch  Life Eraser
Bleeding in the gutters of the underworld
No skin on flesh  your cries not heard
Carving into life of the mankind souls
Abominations cynic as ice is cold
Incineration in 7 stages
Final touch  Life eraserWelcome to a world of hate
Injustice reigns with rage
We try to loose uncertainty
Innocence is gone
We try to move along
A road that's full of anger
Full of hate Disorder
Hold me tight when stars collide
In this place we search our fate
Cry for love for help above
Live your life with dignity
Search your own destiny
A dishonest smile
Another compete stranger
A makeshift love affair
A habit forming secret craving
Temporary pain
At least it eases his hunger
Own the clothes he wears
And a spot on the street
And a life in despair
All have been children
Innocent and full of life
But some get rich while some die young
Listen to the proud
Master of the order
Once a poor child on the streets
It's project destiny
A man that's maimed for life
Imprisoned by his body
Fought for liberty
Until a bomb just turned his standing
Immovable pain
A brain without a body
Rather dead than alive
The reward for his life
Was a stone with his name
All have been children
Innocent and full of life
But some get rich while some die young
Listen to the proud
Master of the order
Once a poor child on the streets
It's project destiny
What if I am the one
Unknown powers to reverse what's upside down
Listen to the proud
Master of the order
Once a poor child on the streets
It's project destiny
I wish we found a cure against
All these Infections
In our society a lethal death injection
So many human lives to save against depression
Caused by the greedy hearts
Arrogance and rapture
When it feels like life is a torture hall
And there is no way out
You just close your eyes
A new tomorrow
You need to realize
You can't just stand there in the cold
And believe it blows over
It is time for a change let your voice be heard
We just have one chance
On this planet earth
Open your mind
Live your life like this day where your last
That's how you stay alive
As you are walking down
The memory lane
Your eyes stay dry
And when you think you're all alone in desperate
Just make the call
You can't just stand there in the cold
And believe it blows over
It is time for a change let your voice be heard
We just have one chance
On this planet earth
Open your mind
Live your life like this day where your last
That's how you stay alive
So surreal
How you conquered your own fears
Ended all without saying goodbye
You are gone
Rest of my days
Now and then a silent tear
will fall from my eyes
It Is heard to say good bye
And believe it blows over
It is time for a change let your voice be heard
We just have one chance
On this planet earth
Open your mind
Live your life like this day where your last
That's how you stay alive
They say that time heals all wounds
Please describe
How long it takes and
How it's done
She looks like an angel from heaven sent
A power you can not describe
You had what you thought
Unconditional
Emotions that ended in hell
Cry in despair
As worlds falling apart
Just show me and
The rest will be a journey
To the STARS
Who decides what is
Destined to be
I wanna live for eternity
She looks like an angel from heaven sent
A power you can not describe
You had what you thought
Unconditional
Emotions that ended in hell
Cry in despair
As worlds falling apart
Just show me and
The rest will be a journey
To the STARS
Like when the darkness
Takes me far away
And when I wake
I fear to sleep again
So many thoughts and tears
I've shed in vain
Until the end
I'm walking on my own
She looks like an angel from heaven sent
A power you can not describe
You had what you thought
Unconditional
Emotions that ended in hell
A broken window
And a bird that gasps for air
The final breath  black eyes
look back at me screaming in despair
In one second I'm awake
And sweat drops falling from my head
Yet another dream
Continuously comes back into me
Message without meaning
Leave a clue  freeze rewind
Where is the sign
What does this really mean
Or am I dreaming in a dream
It's your mind that guides you
In the world around you
Where veracity replies
To creations in your mind
If you're gone tomorrow
Time erases sorrow
As long as you never give in
Your dreams will never die
I'm in a hunt
But I'm the hunted on the run
No matter how determined
I try to run my legs do not reply
I'm on an airplane
And I'm falling through the clouds
But there have been years since then
And still I have no sight of solid ground
Message without meaning
Leave a clue  freeze rewind
Where is the sign
What does this really mean
Or am I dreaming in a dream
Used his skills to build them wings
Out of feathers and of strings
To escape the labyrinth in which they re trapped
Icarus  the son of Daedalus the one
With these wings they would reach to the sun
High above the clouds they'll  fly
That's the only way cause the
Guards are watching land and sea
The King of Crete in agony
He was rebellious  he was bold
So he ignored what he was told
Son you must promise me to never fly too high
Cause the sun is a flaming ball of fire
The wax in the wings might just melt
And you'll fall dead upon the ground
Fly  Into the sun
He is the one and only
Icarus Icarus
High  To touch the sun
He is Daedalus son
Icarus Icarus
To kill the monster Minotaur
The hero begged the inventor
Daedalus and as if that was not enough
Did escape with the lovely daughter
Of king Minos his fury was so great
In the end he lost his mind
I'm getting all upset afraid at the same time
The only thing that counts
Who has the most things the day he dies
Same hunger in us all
To be somebody else
Consort with enemies
To find a way to make them fail
And here I am
Among my friends
But who can I trust
I know there is a place
A place where we belong
Not in this squirrel wheel
Where all comes back to square one
There is a timer set
Awaiting to be found
I guess it's mother earths
Revenge
What can we do
The inner circles sympathy
While we are falling faster
A complex fight
Where no one think alike
Why can't you see our destiny
As long as I'm alive
I'm gonna rest my case
But I am pretty sure that
Someone will reveal it all
Not saying I'm a judge
And I ain't gonna blame
Our society for nuclear winter rains
And here I am
Among my friends
But who can I trust
What can we do
The inner circles sympathy
While we are falling faster
A complex fight
Where no one think alike
Why can't you see our destiny
Communications failed
Somewhere along the way
One word and suddenly
The walls are closing in again
There is a mystery
How anything can work
I'm sick and tired of it all
Those endless battles
Foreign souls
Full speed ahead into the wall
No questions asked no answers needed
One put the sword into the stone
Some read a book to find their home
To me both fairytale and fiction
Some believe they live to die
Some have hopes of higher lives
None have proof of anything but still they die
Gazing at the skies
Is there something for us left to find
Are there secrets among our holy places
That can stop us from ending our race
From the edge of the blade
Some saw the light but they survived
And if they died none could describe
Their ultra rapid stream of memories
I've ceased since long to mind
so many questions undefined
but still they re fighting for their prophecies
Some believe they live to die
Some have hopes of higher lives
None have the proof of anything but still they die
Gazing at the skies
Is there something for us left to find
Are there secrets among our holy places
That can stop us from ending our race
From the edge of the blade
As I am gazing at the stars
And wonder if there's life on mars
All these ecryptic information
Am I walking in circles
Wrapped up in myself
Do I miss a companion
A lover or friend
I don't know I don't know anything more
Feelings are hard to describe
Contradictions collide
I must be my own worst enemy
Suicide is a sin
Here I stand on my own
I'm not alone
My inner demons
Keeps me company
All the time
Every day and  night
Do I falter in darkness on long winding roads
Can I cope with the pressure of such a great load
I don't know I don't know anything more
Why do I talk to myself
Why do I call out for help
I must be my own worst enemy
Suicide is a sin
Here I stand on my own
I'm not alone
My inner demons
Keeps me company
All the time
Every day and  night
Feelings are hard to describe
Contradictions collide
I'm not alone
My inner demons
Keeps me company
All the time
Every day and  night
It was late at night on the open road
Speeding like a man on the run
A lifetime spent preparing for the journey
He is closer now and the search is on
Reading from a map in the mind
Yes there's the ragged hill
And there's the boat on the river
And when the rain came down
He heard a wild dog howl
There were voices in the night  Don't do it
Voices out of sight  Don't do it
Too many men have failed before
Whatever you do
Don't pay the ferryman
Don't even fix a price
Don't pay the ferryman
Until he gets you to the other side
In the rolling mist then he gets on board
Now there'll be no turning back
Beware that hooded old man at the rudder
And then the lightning flashed and the thunder roared
And people calling out his name
And dancing bones that jabbered and amoaned
On the water
And then the ferryman said
There is trouble ahead
So you must pay me now  Don't do it
You must pay me now  Don't do it
And still that voice came from beyond
Whatever you do
Don't pay the ferryman
Don't even fix a price
Don't pay the ferryman
Until he gets you to the other side
Don't pay  the ferryman
Infected by invalid behaviour
While capturing the stench of divine putrefaction
Confess to slavery for the world saviour
Give praise and inhale the corruption
The Enfeebled provides the fool
The Disabled provides the tool
The Apathetic demands the affection
To those suffering from their own satisfaction
Devour in selfdeceit conjure the righteous plague
Testify todays contradiction glorify tomorrows deed
Inconceivable moral priest hide in preferable dress
Invite to another pleasure feast the concealment of joyful laughter
The decrepit innocence of your correctness and wellchosen
Elicits the source of the need for immediate forgiveness
Submit to no grace but the spiteful of your disease
Apply to join the unlimited disgrace and a settlement in the skies
And turn the confusion among your children into selfstimulation
The incarnation of your prostitution the true Evil in disguise
With the ignorance from your cross as the witness
The truth of your tragedy make you justice
In your mirror the high spirit of kindness
Looks like malice
Condemnation of life by the living dead
What a premature judgement contradiction to the core
How unfortunate I am cursed to spend time on a battle already won
The shame that will be guarding your grave says it all
Retreat to the crypt and make it worthwhile
Recall my sins furthermore but still be watching yours with a smile
Incarnated marvels simplified
Effects from such a disconsolate kind
Impotence of the once so perfect living
Erase and rewind
Stand rigid for the next battle
Peace means reloading your guns
The love for life is all hatred in disguise
A carnival creation with masks undone
In search for the guidelines to the gateways of sin
through mires of misanthropy with wrath in mind
Sophistication as cruelty and perfection as virulent truth
Confidently dawned to pick the best of enemies
An abyss womb stretched wide open exposed to retaliate
With the stigma feasting upon your flesh I wish you well
Thorns from the fountains of fate licking lepered skin
Worshipped by anyone's mass on our planet hell
What on earth possessed you
Consuming illusions made from hysteria and swallowed tongues
Devoured by doubt conducting arts of misconception
Testimonial sufficiency declaring numbness of all perceptions
Glance into the blackness hidden beneath your surface
And enjoy the suffering sanity drained in disrespect
With such bedevilled faith in good subsequently trusting evil
Next step for mankind will be the last seasons in sin
Left are the kings of the carnival creation
Carrying out the echoes of the fallen
Sense the withering eternity as it fades away
The ultimate graceless voyage of all times
Only death will be guarding your angels silently
Cripples joining arms in clamour
Institutionalized for the rebirth the herd will be hunted
The apparition of two faces in disgust
Invisible but yet so clear
Reflections seen by a fugitive
Trying to escape the looking glass
Blood runs from open wounds of false flesh
The one in front of the mirror exceeds the image
Eager to leave further but chained still
To crumble into such nothingness
A despairing fate for your lies
To pretend is the lunatic's legacy
Privileged to bolt the nails of heresy
Born lifeless into a world of coma
As the chronic sufferer trapped in paradise lost
Missing insinuations of what life was meant to be
Angels and demons a march man's bewildering hosts
The charlatans and deceivers walk the line in prejudice
The narrow slits the veins in search for the crown
Profound impatience makes the blind struggle in stupidity
The paradox of the daily prayer diffidence is Confiteor
Phenomena of ironies cast the litany aside
How intelligible blessed be the forgetful
Holding the banner high unrestrained
Slowly abandoning the surface in contempt
Still in costumes to please the ways of living
Witnessing the details of defilement intoxicating
Make sure to be pleased with the ways of your death
For in days of reckoning and when the twilight torn is ticking
Elysium is halfway and as an answer to the plea
You're destined to yield fragments of Hell in return
Leave unnoticed with the perfect conscience
With the strength of the spiritual eye
Spirits of the token unchained and free
Recover from the philanthropic macabre frenzy
The pale dove grins black at heart ready to flee
Demon to some angel to others
A dismal universal hiss the sound of public scorn
The brush that sweeps across the spectral fields
This landscape is not without a sense of epic wonder
A vast scale that places this sprawling underworld
Into a realm of frames
With a bloodstorm fading into the distance
Floating without directions over this smouldering landscape
Caught in a moment of transformation
These shades of anatomic malignant nature
Approached on another in an unpleasant way
Frozen in the act of speech desperate to express it's state
Created in a shape to accommodate a wide variety of demonic forms
The realm of the benighted aristocracy of evil most pure
This is where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep
Emerged from the depths of the earth gasps
It rages against mankind to annihilate the earth and worse
It spills the blood like rain the beauty of death it represents
Devouring their flesh with a razorblade smile
Genes would still blindly carry on smouldering ember of hell
Limned with gold leaf the scarlet brush
That sweep all traces of time place and pattern
Total death in every nation
Monuments of vanquished civilization
Just as brilliantly removed ruthlessly eliminated
The cornerstone of human emotions
Has now been drained away
I saw death of a most uncommon nature
We do away with your kind
Countdown to exterminate the human race
4 3 2 1
Let chaos entwine
On defenseless soil
Remove errors of man
And sweep all the weakening kind
I am war I am pain
I am all you've ever slain
I am tears in your eyes
I am grief I am lies
Bygone are tolerance
And presence of grace
Scavengers are set out
To cleanse the human filth parade
I am pure I am true
I am all over you
I am laugh I am smile
I am the earth defiled
I am the cosmic storms
I am the tiny worms
I am fear in the night
I am bringer of the light
Earth successfully erased
Oh look at those lifeless leaves
All their precious pride is taken away
A lost creation for a graven image
Trembling of nothing but their own fear
On behalf of water made to wine
Elements of deception must entwine
Righteous greed and derangement divine
Vacuum is given to the blind
To surrender to a faith so fake
To not comprehend while you're awake
Thrive on your deity for heaven's sake
Do loose your battle before actual birth
For some sheep need the company of a shepherd
To face the scorn of the earth
Existential parasite drama across the lands
What a relief never bother the why's
Investing illusions and folding hands
The passion for mankind's ignorance feeding you lies
All those naked faces empty shells
Procreation of the mind put to rest
Crippled and caged anaesthesia adjust
The lambs of slaughter preoccupied in disgust
Ride the vortex winds with the beast inside
Cast down all memories from a past and future world
The cynic icons and the cryptic writings
As a picturesque creation in force and spirit
Against their reason and will it is time
Give darkness it's passion plea
The venomous tongue
The inevitable poison
Paralyze the angels
Freeze the forgiven
Baptize in fire
Unleash the devil at heart
Unleash the maelstrom mephisto
So sinner mourn well
Make all the swans suffer in hell
The maelstrom of the mephisto left the trace
To revel and feast in undelivered grace
Pledged to judgmental arrogance in
Drawn principles of ignorant falsehood
To comprehend that the sin of life is life itself
A tyranny in torment an innersanctum stealing sleep
In the dimness surrounding the towers of the castle
Where the ravens spread their wings out wide
Dwell in depths of the darker self at any shore of infinity
And watch the relentless paint the soil black
What is being formed echoes throughout eternity
As the painter chooses color no more
Hold your shadows close when the comedy is over
As the days of mourning seem to be the days of joy
Fragments fell from the sky in order to penetrate the eyes
A convict wallowing in a lifetime of lieslies
As cyclones detach from the world above
And all the other worlds beneath them flow
Time winds caressing the dust of cold memories
Sought to strive in twilight mist and penal fire
As daylight suffers night time recollects
For what wind hath drawn near so near
Death has a contract on life and hell inbetween
What was once not certain is now foreseen
When the pendulum is in it's reverse factor
Rivers run red and skies turn black
Accuracies of bloodbaths liberate from within
Conquests of a crooked cross and its coming loss
A magisterial maintenance of diabolic education
Where the opposite of innocence paves way for intelligence
Where pearls are chained for each tragic event
The glorification of deviance in progress
Liars in wait tries to quench their thirst for more
Drowning victims of a parallel universe
The scum of the earth a rejoice of fouls
The world hates you for being precise
Chains of despair
Cloaked by darkness
The thundering echoes of great destruction to come
Mankind's mysteries
The dying world
Madness in it's sweetest form
What shrivels and dies must face the tempest
The angelic heaven bows to the ultimate truth
And melancholy grew
Anticipation mender through madness
Condemned to the same horrid fate
Insanity applauds
How sharp the awakening
Pale as disease
MockingMaddening
Give up the ghost
Cease the gloomy awakening
History foretold
The hidden stigmata
Totally annihilating the ecstasies innumerable
Materialize the vision
Give up the ghost
Cease the gloomy awakening
Thousand different paths
So many sterile ends
I chose the Devil's path
Never shall the sun kiss my face
And caress me with it's burning light
For I dwell in the shadows
And sleep side by side with death
In dark desire I embrace the whore
Giving her an escape from an unworthy life
For with the appearance of the Fallen Angel
I serve Satan
I serve Darkness
I am a prince among the damned
As I've been for eternity
A monarch in a dark paradise
Cursed by life and the living
Oh tremble not my immortal heart
Though you beat in the shadows of death
Eternal life is the blessing
And I shall rule for another thousand years
I blew out the light
Abandoned Jesus Christ
Christian life forms' grief's
We buried their belief's
Waiting for their saviours rebirth
The dawn was soon to come
The dawn would soon be gone
There in that formless abyss was I made
A partaker of the mysteries averse
Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in child take my hand
Here there's no work or play
Only one bill to pay
There's just five words to say
As you go down down down
You're gonna burn in hell
Oh burn in hell
You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well I've played with fire but i don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true so i think that it's time for a turn
Before i burn in hell
Oh burn in hell
Take a good look in your heart tell me what do you see
It's black and it's dark now is that how you want it to be
It's up to you what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now for tomorrow may be far too late
Hear no evil don't you
See no evil don't you
Lay no evil down on me
You're gonna burn in hell
Speak no evil don't you
Think no evil don't you
Play with evil 'cause I'm free
You say you've never seen the light before
Does anyone believe you
Don't let them hear you say anymore
Nothing's really safe around here
We are an imitation of the crown
We never turn the pages
They cannot let your spirit touch the ground
And nothing's gonna change around here no
Crack in the ceiling
Hole in the wall
They bend you over
But you won't crawl away
You've got two in the bushes
One in the hand
They'd make you over
But they can't understand you
You're always gonna be the wild one
Pretend that all you really feel is pain
Just hide behind some sorrow
How sad
But you'd do it all again
I guess that Nobody changes 'round here
Cat in the cradle
Man in the moon
They'd make you over
But it's too soon to know no
Smoke in the kitchen
Fire in the hall
The train is coming
And you can hear it calling
You're always gonna be the wild one
Crack in the ceiling
Hole in the wall
They bend you over
But you won't crawl away
You've got two in the bushes
One in the hand
They'd make you over
But they can't understand you
You're always gonna be the Wild One
There's a crack in the rainbow
There's a hole in the sky
You believed in something
Now it's just a lie yeah
No jokes from the jester
Not a laugh from the clown
And your world is upside down yeah
You can hide in a circle
It's a way to survive
Be another number
At least you'd be alive
Or you can ride with the gypsy
He can take you to hell
And the answers screaming
In a voice you know so well
You  you're made of fire
Never higher
You were made to run
You  you're burning higher
You've got the fire
You were born on the sun
So take a walk with a wild one
It's the way that I've found
You can turn it upside down
How do you feel right now
How does it feel to be alone
How do you feel right now
Tell me
Hey angel  what's your situation
Hey angel  oh oh
Where would you be right now
Waiting to taste your next tomorrow
Where would you be right now
Tell me
Was the pain too strong to take it anymore
So you turned off all the lights and shut the door
Hey angel  what's your destination
Hey angel
Hey angel  we got a complication
Hey angel  oh oh  you're my angel my angel
How do you feel right now
How does it feel to be alone oh
How do you feel right now
How do you feel right now
Oh angel  you're my angel oh my angel
She never breaks into the conversation
He seems to be the reason why she lives
She tries to be the perfect kind of stranger
But we always seem to love the most
The ones who never give yeah
It's between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation
We never have to ask her why she's crying
The smile she had's been kicked into a frown
But still it makes her day to be his pleasure
Should we open up her eyes
Can we ever break the spell
No one can tell
It's between two hearts
A personal combination
Between too hearts
The kind of love with a bad reputation
Put on your party faces and come along
Join in the big parade
Here comes the camera
Do you look as good as your sister
Smile at the animals
They should be the ones in the cages
Turn the pages
Another way to spend a rainy Sunday
Waiting for a call that never comes
The mystery is how she makes her choices
But don't we always choose
The ones who hide the sun
Everyone
It's between two hearts
Love and desperation
Between two hearts
The kind of love
The kind of love
Between two hearts
A personal situation
Between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation
Looking on the side
You're waiting for your life to walk away
Writings on a wall
You just dream forever forever
Face it  it's another day
And it's gonna be the same tomorrow
The sun is gonna go away
So let it shine on  shine on yeah yeah
When you move to the rhythm of shadows
You can hide from the heat of the sun
'Cos If you dance to the beat of the darkness
You burn before the fire's begun
Then comes the night
You come alive
With night music
It keeps spinning around my head
Night music
It's all the things that you never said
And anywhere you are
There's night music
So open up your arms
Let the night time in
Say the word and it begins
In the night you're the song and the singer
You can choose what the band's gonna play
Write the words under cover of moonlight oh
Make some magic with the things that you say
Together we can kill the day
Night music
You're singer and I'm the song
Night music
Where's the place we can belong
Here comes the night
You will survive
Dancing in the moonlight
Makes you feel alive
Open your arms
Let it begin
Just open up the magic
Let the night time in
In the houses of the holy
To the middle of the mystic sea
At the cradle of the world
There's a black cat screaming
And it's not even midnight no
At the cradle of the world
They're screaming for sanctuary
They're screaming at you
Lock up the wolves
Lock up the wolves yeah yeah yeah
Now there's a cloud over heaven
And a pain out of paradise
In your corner of the world
Turn your back on the children
Does it feel like it's colder
In your corner of the world
They're screaming for sanctuary
They're screaming at you
Lock up the wolves
Lock up the wolves
Don't you let'em get away
Lock up the wolves before you play
Or it's over
Lock up the wolves
Don't you let'em get away
Don't you let'em get away
There's no back door to heaven
Just a front door to hell oh
In this corner of the world
Now if you turn your back on the children
Don't you feel it getting colder
In your corner of the world
They're screaming for sanctuary
They're screaming at you
Lock up the wolves
Lock up the wolves
Spent the night on the road
And never saw the miles go
Running away
I've got to get free from myself
How stories were made to be told
And here's the one that I know
I can't hide it anymore
There's evil on Queen Street
I saw the house in the dark
It seemed to say come touch me
I've got a heart
Open the door to my soul
Climb to the top of my stairs
And look into my windows
I can be your wishing well
There's no evil on Queen Street
Let me in
I can warm in the heat of your fire
It's no permanent sin to be bad
If you're sorry
Let me go  you're a promise that comes from a liar
I don't know  if I ever can wash all the evil away hey
Struck a match at the dark
It screamed no no I love you
Together we're strong
You always believed what I'd say hey
But now the heat of a flame
Starts me to remember
There's no evil  no more evil
No evil on Queen Street
Just smoke in the air
No evil anywhere
No evil on Queen Street
He's just an ordinary man
Never gonna live forever
So he takes it where he can
Too many nights without a day
For the sake of being clever
He almost lost his way
He always thought that he could fly
Till he was shot down from the sky
You can't walk on water  don't try
You can't walk on water  my my my
They say there's ice inside his veins
He's the man of a thousand faces
Silver spoons and golden chains
He thought his heart was made of steel
But it never started pounding
Till they strapped him to the wheel
He always thought that he could fly
Till he was shot down from the sky
No matter what you try
You can't walk on water  my my
Can't walk on water  don't let me try
Somebody said we'll make him strong
He can give us all the answers
Tell us right and show us wrong
If you believe it it's no lie
And there is an end to summer
'Cause the winter makes it die
We never looked above his head
And so he missed the things that they said yeah
He always thought that he could fly
Until they shot him from the sky
No matter how you try
You can't walk on water
Can't burn the sun
You can't walk on water
Not anyone
You can't you can't you can't
You can't you can't walk on water
It's just a matter of time
He was the victim and he never saw the crime
He had invisible eyes
He told you truth but you were sure of it lies
'Cause he was twisted you could see it
He was twisted all right
He was the fortunate one
He could have pulled the trigger
But he couldn't get the gun
They told him that he was blind
He didn't understand
'Cause he could see them inside
They were twisted oh
So Twisted
You could feel it they were
Twisted
Twisted up inside
Look inside any window
Come on and see the show
It's the same generation
They set you free
But they just won't let you go  no
It was a matter of time
They told me I was guilty
So I thought I did the crime
I never learned how to cry
And when I told the truth
They were sure it was a lie
Sure that I would cry
Sure of it
Sure of it 'cause I'm so
Twisted
She's twisted up inside
They're twisted
We're twisted
And when you're twisted
There's just no place to hide away
He was ready to rock and roll
So ready to lose control
But when a hungry heart
Gets a taste of freedom  you better look out
He was ready to push and shove
Ready to fight for love
But I've seen it before
And it can make you crazy
The eyes are what you see
Why are they watching me
She was ready to black and white
The colors were just too bright
She loved to fly
But she hated falling
She was caught in the inbetween
Her dirty would not come clean
She ran for light
But she just got darkness
Just when you think you're free
The eyes are what you see
Why are they watching me
Why do they do the things they do
Why are they watching me
Watching you
If only the eyes could see
Then you'd know your destiny
The mind is an enemy
And you just need a friend
Are you ready for rock and roll
Ready to take control
If you see the eyes
Will it make you crazy  crazy
Crazy
My eyes can see inside tomorrow
My eyes can get next to you
Time flies on wings that just get stronger
My eyes are true
My eyes could see the body shakin'
My eyes were clear and bright
Goodbyes are easy to remember
You can see the hurt still there in my eyes
I've fallen off the edge of the world
I've fallen from the top of the mountain
Just to rise again
I've seen it from heaven and hell
I've seen it from the eyes of a stargazer
I want to be invisible
Just get me out of here
Could the dreamer be turning to stone oh
Rock and roll eyes
The color of rainbows  believer of lies
Rock and roll eyes yeah
Don't want to see the end of it all
Just get me outta here
Just get me outta here
Just get me outta here
Rock and roll eyes
The keeper of rainbows
Collector of lies
Rock and roll eyes
My eyes
Rock and roll eyes
Tell rock and roll lies
And rock and roll lies
Never end
Rock and roll friends
With rock and roll trends
And rock and roll ends
With my eyesMeridians cross the sphere
Razorhands slowly bore
Circles after circles
Reach the heart grip the core
Crimson nails scrape the rust
Of a dying sun turning pale
Scarlet eyes pouring ashes
Like lava in the veins of hell
This world deserved better
Than this skyless ground
Of reptile flowers
And sleepwalking hounds
This world deserved far better
Than this endless flood
Of centipedes soldiers
And octopus gods
I'll redescend along meridians
Like the moon dives in oceans
For I have known days have passed
I'll be gone in a quicksandsmile
My pale sun deserves
One last time to burn
It moves tremors splits and blazes
Roots come loose scattered rocks shattered in pieces
Soil rumbles struggles breaks the chain
Skies torn asunder white stained rain
Gaping mouths of dirt scars wide open
Ground erupts you collapse I burn
Limbs and depths dwell within
Earthlike eyes blinking
Trapped on both sides of this quartered world
Hands united gaia dismembered
This is the endless tide just a movement
The great divide of continents
The great divide of continents
But you fade away beyond reach
Letting storms rushing across the breach
And through the coins on our lids
Can we see how long we'll bleed
As this night has no bounds
Would I wait for the crack of dawn
Would I wait for the crack of dawn
Red sands whirl around
Horizon splinters
Stellar suns spiral dawn
Seconds and lightyears
Petals and wings unfold
Arms outstretched
We wait and watch
For dreams made flesh
No bound hands or closed eyelids to hide
Soil and clouds and men collide
Blooming bodymoths take flight
Blue haloes in a tangerine light
World drowns
All fall down
Lotus glows
Pierces the earth
Cross the gates
Of universe
Satan is scared
I'm not only not only flesh I'm not me
I'm not only not only flesh that's not me
 I'm not me
 That's not me
Marble clouds stretch over there
As I try to follow
This hazy shade
This icy shade
Twisting and blurring in the distance
Footsteps elusive disappearing
Far away in a million directions
Anywhere elsewhere nowhere
But I would murder a thousand deaths
I could stop the clocks and hold my breath
To grasp you for real
To grab anything
Melting wax cracking glass
Multiply your face in many forms
Fragments and fragments and fragments
In a tunnel of mirrors
In a corridor of sand
There's a snowblinding glare
The horizons of maud land
And I roam and I crawl
Like drifting through aeon
Through iron walls abandon
I roam and I call for you
For I linger still
In this world of emptiness
I picture your fragrance
Through the afterflesh
Wings of lead over dormant seas
Burden of feathers
You blue seraph vanishing
Trying to flicker as you burn
In the hands of mighty sun
Incandescent solar flares
Consuming rainbows in your hair
Until you fall hereafter
Far far away
Dim lilywhite light
Out of sight
And within smoke within mist
Among dead and lying trees
I lose your track
I lose my way
And now this home is a maze
With childrenheaded walls
Spitting cries
Spitting wails
At my face
As I howl
And I die killing time
Counting hours watching days fall
One by one
And I die spending nights
On the paths of grief serpentine
Waiting for glows to heal
Waiting for whispers to speak
Wishing for sleep to come
And restart everything
There is a silence where hath been no sound
There is a silence where no sound may be
There is this silence
Drumming beating bursting my ears
She rises rises higher and higher
Scratches the roof of universe
Then dives alas sinks in my veins
Drumming beating breathing in my brain
This is the morphic waving endless void
A ghostly orchestra for swarms of insects
Scarabs and locusts and furies play in my chest
Drumming beating without rest
Can you see those devouring fires
Spreading infinity and silence this silence
Don't you hear the immaculate wings of absence
Drumming beating in a deafening cadence
Humming blows fractured ground starlight in pieces
Dying haloes all around melting seas and shrinking spaces
And where you as the world falls apart
Drumming beating drowning in my heart
Silence will have taken your place
When I rise towards the surface
Six walls wide and blank
When I reach the riverbank
And now everything is nothingness
And nothingness is where I stand
Just a small twinkling star
Pulsing carved in my hand
A green iris
Staring
Gazing
An eye wide open a tiny fire
Tears and embers
Rolling along in my fingers
And in every searing moonbeam
Through aching mercury dreams
In every scary nightblow
I can guess your face through the floe
But anyway
The claws of gravity can crush me
And nail me deeply
Down to the earth
I will stay at the gate
Waiting and waiting
To slaughter and trample on
Those unlighted saints
Lying on the floor
Those beasts of prey
Those stealing whores
Those starving supernovas
Those infrablack omegas
Eating love spitting grief
From above from beneath
Changing children into silence
This silence
This drilling pounding presence
Endless
Soundless
Terrifying sentence
Whirling louder and louder
This silence
As a drummerGot you in the headlights
Of a stolen car
Sold my soul
Your TV your VCR
Deserve me you deserve me
Deserve me you deserve me
I'm your father's pimp
Your mother's whore
Your children all know my name
Come to score
Enslaved by money
Money is your god
Your dreams are my nightmares
Your dreams are my nightmares
Shackled by rules
Rose tinted views
Blind to the lies
You're almost alive
Heads buried in blind faith
Scrambled by slogans
Your ignorance appalls me
Your ignorance appalls me

Rotting in angelic flesh stench of heaven burning
Gorging on the savior rebirth through atonement
Secreting the filth that fills the crypts
Swallowed soul vomits forth
Spines are severed and collected
Torn apart from the corpses
Bodies left decaying beneath the rotting sky
Their detached heads impaled upon stakes
Watching their savior die
He is no longer healer of the sick
Perished through atonement
Condemned by his father
To perish with the lepers immaculate punishment
Dethroned by his prophets
Decaying false testament in a paradox of abandonment
Atonement of misconception
Death through endless suffering
No after life deliverance scripture of defiance
Rotting in angelic flesh stench of heaven burning
Gorging on the savior consuming on his innards
Life no longer everlasting
Perished through atonement
Aiming at history the trigger is pulled
Manmade plague spreading worldwide
Millions forcefed with the reces of the infested
Eardrums pierced with polished glass
Scartissued beast that still roar
Hatred and profanity underground
A funeral for mental health
Remedy for the true at heart
Your witchcraft denies them
The pleasure of being set free
Your witchcraft arouse them
Salvation unable to see
Sheep in wolf clothes searing ignorant minds
Betrayal bloodbath for their endless crimes
Prophets lying untrue worship the silent queen
Their hypocrisy indecent and obscene
Leprosy madmen kings of the old
The faithful outcasts fewer but stronger
Blades sharpened shinning metal of death
Punish the traitors those once loyal
1914 Nations bleed in the Great War to end all wars
young men march on towards the frontline
Unknowing of the horrors to come
Europa burns
1916 young men fight on
Most of them gone in the western campaign
Count the dead and justify
That nothing has been gained
Mass the troops for another push
A sacrifice to the rain of steel
As Europa burns
1918 young men are gone
Horribly maimed in nomans land
Trenches are filled with blood of the dead
Human waste of world war one
Judgement day is near
Armies gather on the plains Megiddo
Angels of heanly might against the forces of darkness
Soldiers of hell twilight of mankind
Under a blood red sky warriors of god will die
Followers of the holy script pay the ultimate price
Into the void they fly a final battle cry
Hear the masses roar we will fuck your god
Screaming victims agonized in pain
We rather burn in than suffer the tyranny of god
Internal tension erupt in war a proud nation is no more
Under siege four long years blood flows with a million tears
Limit of endurance civilian dance macabre
Existence of misery sorrow filled destiny
Broken glass under children's foot
Rivers run red with the blood of the dead
Unseen troops in disguise in positions high above
The hills have eyes waten you die sniper the ends of your Life
Massacre of innocent targets of opportunity
Hunt the soon to be dead
Run for cover run for life someone got you in their sight
The all seeing sniper scope terminate survival hope
From cold north to scorching desert sands
A vast empire ruled with iron hand
Peace through war not with alive branch
Join or die submissionthe only chance
ready shield and sword against barbaric hordes
Fear the Praetorian Guard Emperor's elite
Military might enslave the free
Incorporation into tyranny
Lay down your banners at your feet
Through conquest we bring you peace
Ruthlessly crush opposition
We are the masters of oppression
We march we bleed
We crucified your Christ
We siege we conquer violently
We are Legion
 From combat glory to Elysian Fields
What we achieve echo in eternity
Loyalty honor blood and death
Shoulder by shoulder
�arade your dead through our streets
as humiliation in defeat
Beheaded leaders demonstrate
Our power to decide your fate
Spoils of war riches and slaves
All will sponsor the next campaign
Feasting on the vanquished
Legions rejoice
Over seas of ice and snow
Through raging waters to foreign shores
We bring you fire shield and sword
We are your fucking overlords
Hallucinogenic bloodlust
Berserker rage
Sons of the north
Ferocious beyond insane
Raping burning killing
Pillage murder
Merciless slaughter
Bringers of death and pain
The coast is ablaze with brutal raids
Destruction as far eyes can see
Massive funeral pyres burning
Where your villages used to be
With the god of war on our side
We don't fear to die
To the Land of the midnight sun
Tide of blood bring me home
Death lurks in every bush
Landmines and booby traps
Fanatic adversaries
Screaming maniacs
Combat fatigue insanity
Enemy everywhere even in dreams
Physically unhurt mentally disturbed
The jungle echoes with the howl of the deranged
Day after day in the line
Driven beyond breaking point
Constant strain comrades slain
Slaughter house of the damned
Behind the frontline
Shell shocked
The madness goes on
Killing friend and foe
Screaming ghosts roam the silent battlefield
Locked in eternal conflict neither side never to yield
The blood soaked soil littered with shrapnel flesh and bone
A gruesome scenery mosaic of mans destructive need
The stench of rotting corpses human debris and waste
An eternal embrace with mankind's insanity
Scarred warrior covered with unhealing wounds
Enemies once united by hatred now united in death
No glory in blood no honor in death
The reward of the brave is a nameless grave
The curse of battle forever live on in their souls
Soldier demons undead they stalk the earth
Body split in two trembling hands
Touch what is left on me
Try to force back guts where they belong
Bleed profusely writhe in agony
Every heartbeat an eternity
I don't want to die
But this has to end
Sirensong of death Life fade away
Cries for help no one hears
Existence of pain
To end it all is the only option
I reach for my weapons so close but yet so far
I lift up my intestines examine them closely
what has become of me where is the rest of me
So I close my eyes and draw my last breath
No more pain and agony at the end I welcome death
I curse you god who did this to me
Forgotten soldier left to rot
Among other corpses
A nameless casualty
In mankind's bloody history
We are wolfpack we rule the seas
In the dark depths we reign supreme
Run silent run deep track the hostile fleet
Playing deadly hide  seek day and night
Dive dive dive destroyer sighted
Dive dive deep out of harms way
Depth charges detonate
Closely enough to seal their fate
Iron sweat and blood
One hundred men
Sinking to their silent grave
panic spreads no way out
Flooded compartments
Diesel fumes fire consumes
Human flesh burnt to death
Claustrophobic coffin of steel
Broken hulk descent into the dark
Unholy alliance science and the occult
A world war Legend still waiting to unfold
A military industry in underground death factories
Produce more and more esoteric weapons of war
Clandestine operations
Inhumane experimentations
Treading unknown paths explore the bizarre
Twist the tide reverse the fortune of war
Unnatural sightings mysterious Lights
Dark secrets of the Reich
The legacy of the black sun
Burning bright in the sky
Are they lying in wait beneath the polar ice
Or hiding in the dark side of the moon
Over 60 years have passed legend remain unsolved
As the war was lost they took their secrets to the grave
Will they emerge from the shadow
Vengeance and victory rise to power once moreRain down fire 
Put on the crown that you made for yourself
You wear it so beautifully
Not a thought not a care for anyone else
You're just a poison and we are the vaccine
You're just a poison
Dripping off the fangs of a snake
You lack conviction
Your reign will end tonight
And I watched you rise from nothing
Just like a peasant living off the land
You think you're a god but you're barely a man
acting in charge when everything goes according to plan
as soon as you fail you quickly disappear
just like a snake hiding from the heat of the sun
We will set your kingdom ablaze
Rain down fire
Just like a poison we will bleed you from our veins
Cauterize the wound
Take your last breath tonight take your last breath
This will be the end the end of you
And I watched you rise from nothing
Just like a peasant living off the land
Rain down fire
we will set your kingdom ablaze
Rain down fire
You lack conviction
You're just a poison 
We will bleed you from our veins
You're just a poison 
Your reign will end
Rain down fire
When there's nothing left to say
When there's nothing more to do
Where your time has run out
This is death for the dead
Death for the dead
Lying in your deathbed
So go and feel the anger
shadows dance across the room
Though you scream at the top of your lungs
There's no one there to save you
I am the martyr
I lie here forever
They stand there laughing all around
Will you return to me when you die
So go on into the night
Just know I will never leave your side
My bride
I am the martyr
Lie here forever
They stand there laughing all around
but I'll return when I am in the ground
When there's nothing left to say

When your time has run out

When time has run out

Death for the dead

Will there be a dawn
This unseen war approaches
Like prey we are stalked
This darkness falls upon us
The darkness creeps in
They hide in the shadows
I can see them creeping
I can hear them breathing
Be on the frontline
Beyond the crowd
Behind the dangerous who shake the ground
Be on the frontline
Beyond the crowd
Beneath the barriers they make no sound
Do not be shaken
By the whisper of his name they will fear you
This is darkness approaching upon us
There is a veil that shields their world from our own
Rip apart the veil
Replace this darkness with light
Will there be a dawn
Or are we forever fighting this unseen war
Resist the darkness
I'll bring the fight to you again and again
You'll run in fear with your tail tucked between your legs
For the power behind us is greater
Now you will never stand in our way
This unseen war approaches
Like prey we are stalked
This unseen war is upon us
Will there be a dawn
Will there be a dawn
Will there be a dawn
Will there be a dawn
Do not be shaken
You are not alone in the darkness
Do not be afraid
By the whisper of his name they will fear you
This is darkness
This is darkness
I spared your life today
That's a debt I intend to collect
Rewind the clocks
This is the hour
The tower of Babel
Shoot your arrows towards the sky
You will behold a king who will not be challenged
now you will wander until you die
There's nothing new underneath the sun
we continue to fight but the battle's already been won
As we continue to rebel we only bury ourselves deeper into hell
Into hell
Deeper and deeper into the darkness they descend
never to return
never to be seen again
They bear the mark of the fallen angel
An army gathered from the darkest of places
they wrought death upon the land
their hatred consumes everything in their path
They bear the mark of the fallen angel
An army gathered from the darkest of places
they wrought death upon the land
Against their corruption we must make a stand
All hell cannot contain
The power of the risen king
Satan will be defeated
We will stand by and watch him fall
They bear the mark of the fallen angel
They bear the mark of the fallen one
They bear the mark of the fallen angel
They bear the mark of the fallen one
You bear the mark 
Deeper and deeper into the darkness they descend
Never to return never to be seen again
I spared your life today
That's a debt I intend to collect
You bear the mark of the fallen angel fallen angel
Deeper and deeper into the darkness they will descend
Never to return never to be seen again

Show me heaven
Show me hell
Tell me of the day that Satan fell
Show me glory
Show me grace
let me gaze upon your sacred face
If God was standing right in front of you
would you spit out hate like you always do
If God was standing right in front of you
Would you try to change your fate
Show me heaven
Show me heaven
Show me heaven show me your face
Lift me up into your presence
I want to see
I want to see
Satan fall
Face to the ground as his crown was destroyed
Cast down to the earth by
The wrath of a king with the heart of a lion
Did all of heaven weep
or was there only silence
When the hour came and his choice was made
did he know that all his glory would fade
did he know that all his glory would fade
Show me hell
How does it feel to know that one day you will burn in hell
for a crime committed against the holy one
Did you know you would not succeed
you had too know you would fail against my God
If God was standing right in front of you
would you spit out hate like you always do
If God was standing right in front of you
Would you try to change your fate
Did all of heaven weep
or was there only silence
Did all of heaven weep
or was there only silence
When the hour came and his choice was made
did he know that all his glory would fade
Show me heaven
Show me hell
Oh no My god has driven you away
Please God can you spare some change for a beggar
Night after night I scream but nobody's listening nobody's listening
We are headed down a path where the rocks peel the flesh from our feet nobody's listening
How much worse do things have to become before we rise up from the ruins
We are a generation that will stab you in the back just to get a piece of the pie
Form a line to spare a dime as you watch countless children die
We are moving forward but we've never been so far behind
We're all just killing time by putting a knife through every clock that we find
We're all just killing time
Can you hear the cries of desperation
Can you hear the cries of desperation
Can you see the fire reduce to embers
We are a generation that will stab you in the back just to get a piece of the pie
Where did it all go wrong
When did we lose our way
How can we fight for each other when we can't even stand our ground
Where did it all go wrong
When did we lose our way
Why do we run and hide as we watch our children die
Can you hear the cries of desperation
Can you see the fire reduce to embers
Can you hear the cries of desperation
Can you see the fire reduce to embers
Can you hear the cries of desperation
See the face of starvation
We form a line to spare a dime as we watch countless children die
We're all just killing time by putting a knife through every clock that we find
Killing time
Can you ever forgive me
I will never forgive myself
I've lost the one I held most dear
All because of my own selfish desires
God forgive me for I will never forgive myself
Heal me
I scream at everything I am broken
At everything I am
Free me
For I will never forgive myself
Cleanse me
For I am the disease
I am anger
I am hate
I am hypocrisy I'll crush your face
I am anger
I am hate
I am hypocrisy
Don't look at me
You were all that I held most dear
Now all that I regret
My hate has torn you apart
God forgive me
I cannot forgive myself
Heal me
I scream at everything I am broken
At everything I am
Free me
For I will never forgive myself
Cleanse me
God forgive me for I will never forgive myself
I will never forgive myself
You were all that I held most dear
Now all that I regret
My hate has torn you apart
God forgive me
I cannot forgive myself
My hate has torn you apart
God forgive me I cannot forgive myself
God forgive me I cannot forgive myself
God forgive me I cannot forgive myself
God forgive me I cannot forgive myselfA window into the other side Behold the wonders this realm has to hide A breakthrough in scientific ascension granted us sight into another dimension Bending matter space and time the strings slowly begin to unwind Deep within the military confines we watch in awe
so many questions on our minds This world does obfuscate tempting us to go beyond the gate Recalibrate the machine soon we'll journey into a new world So preoccupied with what we could never stopped to ask if we should Disregarded our sense of ethics morals give
way to curiosity A probe created for this purpose alone now is the time venture into the unknown
Fantastical the landscapes and beings Things thought to only inhabit our dreams Beneath blankets of opaque ominous mist a world wherein celestial creatures do exist Excavation samples we have to yield Phenomenal truths to be revealed Only in time will we come to

Translucent flesh showcasing vital organs and illuminated skeletal structures Enchanted by otherworldly beings How peculiar Peculiar form of sustenance draining lifeforce from other entities Oh the discovery Everything about them draws us in
Curiosity Our lust for knowledge requires a specimen on which to preform tests and dissection What are the risks No signs of aggression We're going in Upon the first sign of danger we'll close the gate

Over time we've plotted our move our gaze ever watchful Analyzing samples gathering intel And yet they don't seem to have a clue that we're watching Of what we're to do In the dead of night whilst hidden from sight we steal this creature of light On our way back
to our plane in tow the creature we did confiscate Let the research begin Such glorious finding will be steeped in our sin Sedation quickly takes effect sprawled out so helplessly fulfill my morbid curiosity Beneath our blades this creature regenerates but with no
mist to breath it quickly becomes deceased Commotion What is that sound coming form the other side Extraterrestrials storm the gate A force once believed to be impenetrableShatters
Clouds of mist spill through the veil lurking within are the creatures of light While we're running rampant stricken with fright At this rate it wont be long until our base is overthrown It seems the time has come to reap what we have sown And as we are falling back
they launch their ghastly attack Picking us off one by one My god what have we done
What are we to do as their world spills into ours Take up arms we must defend our planet from this scourge From those fiends who would end it
Translucent flesh showcasing vital organs and illuminated skeletal structures Enchanted by otherworldly beings How peculiar Peculiar form of warfare Draining souls from their enemies Ghastly discovery Demons disguised in angelic skin
Curiosity our lust for knowledge resulted in catastrophe Our base now overrun by these monstrosities Now we're left with no way to close the gate It would seem that we have sealed our fate
A window within the military citadel spews beasts from the depths of hell Ethereal creatures tear through the veil how could we ever hope to prevail Their form of warfare of sustenance will leave you cold They will devour your soul Leaving behind only a shell of
your former self
A close proximity is all it takes for these fiends to feast upon the very essence of your being Their regenerative properties render our arsenal obsolete Oh the humanity I never thought I'd see such grievous atrocities
We're left with no way to destroy the gate It seems that we have sealed our fate
A close proximity is all it takes for these fiends to feast upon the very essence of your being Their regenerative properties render our arsenal obsolete Screams of the wouldbedamned echo through the air Inter dimensional warfare for which we are hopelessly
unprepared Swarms of demons shift from city to city leaving soulless bodies in their wake A self inflicted genocide to which there is no end in sight There must be some way to vanquish these foes There must be some way to right what we have done There must be some
way to destroy the gate There must be some way to save our souls
Because of our abilities primitive beings believe us to be demons or gods How could they ever comprehend our true purpose Eons ago we were created for the purpose of consuming the souls of wicked beings Only through us can they be cleansed and sent back into the
universe until they are reborn into their new vessels free from the sins committed in their past lives Most know there is no escape and they accept their fate When the sentients come to call
Into the gate it is not too late to save their eternal lives Venomous minds and tainted souls would bring death to all that we know Never forget that its our purpose to lay their noxious souls to rest When will your sleeping minds awaken to realize that your lack of
virtue has left you in disrepair That you're not alone For we have come to save you from the depths of despair This burden is one that we'll share
And yet so many of you believe us to be monsters For the truth is this we've come to pluck you from you're decrepit vessels As your souls become one with me so do your emotions so do your memories And they weigh heavily upon my heart Its almost more than I can
bare Yet I must go on This crusade has only just begun
In my eons I've felt nor seen so much anger hatred and pain Human beings have strayed from the path now you must face our sacred wrath Primitive souls if only you knew the truth behind what we must do I'm drifting back to that fated day when our worlds merged
when it all changed
Elder what is that foul aura
Child those are tainted souls Stained by corruption and immorality Years have passed since we've been plagued by such hideous wavelengths They'll meet the same end
What could have caused this sort of disturbance How have their souls been rotting unnoticed
They're not of this world Come with me child we must find the source to end this contagion's path of rancor This strange portal seems to be the source emitting the wavelengths of countless souls Gather the masses they too need to see the danger of this strange
reality This race is dangerous we must put an end to it Their venomous minds and tainted souls would bring death to all we know We must absolve them of their sins before it becomes too late Let the cleansing begin we must absolve them of sin
I've always been so very curious attempting to quench my insatiable thirst Oh how glorious finding science was there's nothing I can't solve The answers to it all Now look where my passions landed me I've been lead astray by curiosity Now face to face with the
being that will end my life Locked in stasis yet I have no fear The creature moves near Start the transmission my last find to be heard by all mankind
 I am directly responsible for these events which have began to unfold This is my last experiment my penance though it cant replace what you have lost I'm about to loose my soul As this creature moves closer my heartbeat accelerates where once was calm fear now
takes its place Though I can barely open my mouth I must get this message out Flashing before my eyes memories now fading away Growing cold So cold I can only watch as this being reaps the essence from me Growing weak So weak I feel as though I'm
being ripped out evicted from my body A strange voice is calling out to me could it be this voice of this being
Now heed my call Mortal don't resist me You cant escape this fate The life that you know will soon come to an end
Now devoid of all hope all happiness a deep despair begins to take root Agonizing pain throws me to the ground
Don't worry it wont be much longer now
My life Well What's left of it now flashes before my eyes My memories will soon be no more Just like me Just like my soul
You have brought this hell upon yourself These events were never meant to be
Our curiosity resulted in atrocity Crossed cosmic boundaries that were simply never meant to be Our prying minds provoked the wraith of sacred entities Our curiosity resulted in atrocity Is this really it our souls purpose To be eaten to suffer like this
In truth you were meant for so much more But your species have chosen the path of rancor The misdeeds of your past incarnations have left your souls in a state of desolation
In a moment it sends to me the truth of all we are and all we're meant to be
Now this life must come to an end this bodies jut a vessel you must transcend
Stunning images through telepathy my soul beckons me to be freeTrained from birth how to kill
Suicide campaign
Brainwashed to believe
MARTYR
Blood shed from years of war
Clamor for revenge
Human killing machines

Pray to a deity you've been told
Raging your war hymns
Victims once again

MARTYR
Gas fume vapors infest the air so thick
One match now stricken
this game will now begin
Flames of combustion
Spreading through your lungs
Spastic reaction blistered
black your tongue
Hair evaporates your skin
begins to melt
Inhale to scream can't rid
this pain your dealt
Ravaged Carbon released
Ravaged your life deceased
Boiling point of your blood see the death toll rise
Human wall of flames no one will survive
Engraving flesh with flame leaving his mark
Evidence left to burn blackened at heart
Ravaged serial killer
Ravaged pleased by life he took
Distress inflicted upon affliction and suffering
Sacrifice death overthrown
Offer your life pain is thy home
Bleed for me I'll die for you
Tribulation of the one cursed by doom
Torment one way to survive
Only the strong will remain
Overcome the wicked shall
fall guided by forces unknown
Frozen terror inside your eyes
Look in the mirror see your despise
Heresy abundant loss dwell
and beware the path you cross
Paradise thrown to the ground
For disaster where your life is bound
Victory domination last one to stand
Will rule tribulation
Distress inflicted upon affliction and suffering
Crisis close to death
Defeat conscious sin
Awakened from her tomb 
at dusk she will appear
To rise above the moonlit sky
from home beyond the grave
The children of the forest
Descend into the night
Howling through the glowing mist
for hunger they will feed
AT DUSK THEY RISE
Cast into the shadows the
hunt will now begin
Craving blood of innocence
victims to her spell
Appetite increases the evening still so young
Nocturnal driven anguish
reanimates the dead
Jugular penetration
paralyzed for the feast
Inhuman blood transfusion
her veins now warm with life
Arise queen of the undead
strike fear into their eyes
Like cattle in the darkness
quenching her eternal thirst
The cemetary beckons return unto the grave
At dawn she will be
weakened for soon the sun shall arise
The tomb has been discovered uncovered in her sleep
Drive the stake into thy heart
forever lay in peace
AT DUSK THEY RISE
Verge of destruction past life a mess
Domesticated father knows best

Day of reckoning want to be the
thing inside you will unleash
Voices in your head they command
Carry out these dreadful plans
Awaiting the day in disarray
Stalking his prey those he betrayed
Building inside terror will hide
When it's released horror will feast
Blood will flow rage the beast
Hunt for you life will cease
Mass destruction cities fall
The end is near for life you crawl
Sirens holler nowhere to run
Earthquakes shatter disaster done
Volcanic eruptions the death
toll will rise
Natural disaster hear
tormented cries
Burning in fire lungs explode
Not prepared to die
These events have been foretold
The world now gone your life consumed
Tidal waves smother engulfed in endless storm
Hurricanes swarming

Collide with fear demolished

Slice of the blade penetrate the flesh
Form pools of blood your head I crush
With broken glass in cruor you are blessed
Scream like a bitch into your face my fist
Your turn to pray time to feel karma
Violent wrath persecution drama
Enter my world one thing you will regret
Mutilation the concrete you have met
The nightmare has begun
charges have been pressed
I plead not guilty no bond for my arrest
To many options so very little time
Time served I've paid for this crime
Aggravated battery
You begin to bleed
Aggravated battery
Growing hate filled seed
Aggravated battery Time to feel pain
Aggravated battery I'm the one insane
Stabbed into the back
Your kind you betray
Lie into my face
False are the words you say
Last chance your offer
Grab the cash and run
Grand theft committed
Worse form of a con
The path you leave behind
With the damage done
Live a life of crime
You're the guilty one
Traidor
Cuidate del traidor
Traidor
Cuidate del traidor
Your small mind altered
By the drugs you take
Convinced of your own lies
You've become a fake
Take what is not yours
Back into hiding
Your acts are corrupt
Far from law abiding

I am the resurrection and the life
He who believes in me
Will live even when he dies 
It's time to open uyp our eyes
To see the light beyond this world

The balance is hard to find
We all have to face who we are in the end

The show must go on
I'm not afraid to see it
My faith keeps me strong
I lift my voice to the sky
You're my passion my fire my light
You are my shield
My secret weapon
Into the future we run
No time for reflection at all
Where can I rest my tired soul
The pace of this world Out of control
I am leaving the desert
Heading for holy water
Oh Holy water
I need protection in this moment
Shelter me through the shadows
My life is not as easy as it seems
Now it's black as the ace of spades
I try to do the best I can
To serve your name
In a brutal world where the ego serves
I look up to the sky
And I raise my voice
And pray for wisdom
Give me answers to my questions
Divinefire
You give me eyes to see
Divinefire
Give me love for the broken ones
Divinefire
I'll serve you night and day
Divinefire
My life belongs to you
How far can I go
Before it is too late
I feel so lost in the dark
My ego wants it all
No room for mercy
No room for love
I look up to the sky
And I raise my voice
And pray for wisdom
Give me answers to my questions
Divinefire
You give me eyes to see
Divinefire
Give me love for the broken ones

All alone the way
You've been there for me
Never feeling lonely
Every single moment
You're looking out for me
You are the burning fire
That lives inside of me
I'm living in this world
The time is very closer
Closer to the end
But I know my heart yeah
You saved me You guide me
I never understand your Love
You are the Hero of my life
You love You see me
You are the Master of it all
You are the Hero of my live
The Hero of my life
I face another day
And hold on to your flame
You're the One and Only
Every since that day
When I gave my heart to you
You are the One who sees
The man I want to be
I'm living in this world
The time is very closer
Closer to the end
But I know my heart
You saved me You guide me
I never understand your Love
You are the Hero of my life
You love You see me
You are the Master of it all
You are the Hero of my live
The Hero of my life
I'm looking for a better world
People crying out for help
Need your love to do things right
You know I want to follow you
And show the world freedom
Death will be no more
Time to move on
Together we're strong
We believe in the son
Everyone's invited
Faith hope and love
And his heavenly grace
We're united as one
Yeah the door is open
Sometimes it's hard to see the way
When the world is crashing down
Keep the faith and don't give up
He will wipe away your tears
Hear your desperate prayers
He's been through it all
Day by day night by night
Take my time and my fruits will be fine
I am alive just feel the fire
Right or wrong
He will show me the way
Now is the time of my life
Don't you know the judgment day is near
No more sorrow
No more tears
No more pain
Leave the shadows behind
No more sorrow
No more tears
My sins are forgiven
Salvation for mankind
I'm leaving the shadows behind
He is coming he is shining
The final reason I'm singing this song
I am alive just feel the fire
Right or wrong
He's the bright morning star
I wanna see
Just tell me how to use the key
I want to enter the door
I wanna know
I see the light you have inside
Give me the code to be sure
Break down the walls
You must believe in your heart
This is the secret from above
My help comes from my God
Who made heaven and earth
Time will tell when we'll see the signs
And the blind will finally see so
Open your eyes
I know it's hard
I know it's hard to hear the truth
You want the easy way out
Your sacrifice
You have to swallow your pride
To find the answer tonight
Afraid to live
Afraid to die
Seize the moment
You're alive
Let the music take you far away
Time to live
Enjoy your life
Hear the music from above
It's a new beginning
Time to live
Seize the day
See the future with new eyes
It's a new beginning
We're here to rock
Show you the force
Seize the moment
You're alive
Rise my child
Don't give up
Rise my child
Don't give up
Rise my child
Time to live
The time is yours
You hear the music and you'll remember
Only you can change your life
Only you
Empty spaces  what are we living for
Abandoned places  I guess we know the score
On and on does anybody know what we are looking for
Another hero another mindless crime
Behind the curtain in the pantomime
Hold the line does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Whatever happens I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache another failed romance
On and on does anybody know what we are living for
I guess I'm learning I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly  my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On  with the show 
I'll top the bill I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the 
On with the show 
The show must go on
Contradiction it's an expedition into darkness
Aggravation is the inspiration into madness
Soon the day will come when all the world will finally see
It's a matter of time / the sand will run out
Waiting for the rising sun
Erase the Slate
Erase the Slate
My religion is a mind condition as it turns out
Hesitating while my soul sits waiting through my blackout
Soon the day will come down when I'll reflect on all those years
My perfect world / sublime and surreal
Waiting for the rising sun
Erase the Slate
Erase the Slate
Erase the Slate
Erase the Slate
Time and time remember when
Life forgave my call
Too much pride / could not repent
Can't escape at all
Erase the Slate
Erase the Slate
Erase the Slate
And start again
Erase the Slate
Erase the Slate
And start all over again
Erase the Slate
Talk to me 'bout fantasy
You talk to me 'bout love
You filled me with empty promises
You promised sky above
You ask me what I'd do for you
Give my life and more
But would it keep you satisfied
Baby I'm not sure
I change myself most everyday
But you don't reply
How can we survive
I can't Change the World
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't Change the World
This time I can't Change the World
From soft lips you speak to me
How's it gonna be
Everyday's a different story
Changing all the time
You come to me with promises
I listen as you speak
But the promise that you want the most
Is not for me to keep
You leave me on this withered vine / now
Stripped away and torn
Left with only fantasy
Dreams of nevermore
I can't Change the World
If I tried would it make you happy
This time I can't Change the World
Never said that I held the answers
I can't Change the World
I'd give my spirit if you tried
A fortune lost a heart denied
I come to you in your sleep
My heart is yours for only you to keep
And when the days they pass me you will see
I can't Change the World
If I tried would it make you happy
I can't Change the World
This time
I can't Change the World
I never said I held the answers
I can't Change the World
This time
I can't Change the World
Change the world
Talking to my rabbit friend he seems so bright indeed
A conversation over tea
Then he told me / I'm standing all alone
There's a crowd of people eating at my throne
Is it just me / is it just you
Or is it everyone
I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the Maddest Hatter
Of them all
And it's so contrary that I know I shouldn't
Watch the rainbows circle my friend Mary
I wish that I could fly so I can see much more
I wish that I could see things
Like the others do
If it's just me / then it's just you
I'm not the only one
I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the Maddest Hatter
Of them all
I want the ordinary
I wanna be with my friend Mary
I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the Maddest Hatter
Of them all
I want the ordinary life
When the sky is dark I feel like it's light
I want the ordinary life
I must confess / I'm the Maddest Hatter
Of them all
I been left in the crossfire / sacrificed to love and hate
Out of ammunition to regain my mental state
I found myself adrift upon an endless sea
Of lies and bitterness / horizon out of reach
I see the starts that shine / Reflection in the waves
I need to find that distant shore
Before I Drown
Slip beneath the waves and Drown
Takes me to my grave
Of love and heartache / there's got to be a way
That I can save myself before I Drown
Too much conversation can erode our little minds
My emancipation comes with solitude at night
As the world sleeps / I contemplate all that's been done
I profess no innocence / I've held  held that smoking gun
I found myself atop a sea of ocean blue
Cast from a world that left me too
To Drown
Slip beneath the waves and Drown
Takes me to my grave
Of love and heartache / there's got to be a way
That I can save myself before I Drown
I'll Drown
Slip beneath the waves and Drown
Takes me to my grave
And Drown
From the pouring rain
Of love and heartache / there's got to be a way
I can save myself
Save myself Before I Drown
Lonely / why do I feel this way
If you're so in love with me / why do you stay away
Heartache / breaking down my pride
The closer that I get to you the more I hurt inside
Feeling I've been wrong about you
Try to justify
I'm feeling empty inside
I see the heartache you hide in your eyes
I'm feeling empty inside
Shattered
Shattered / trying to get to you
Left my heart in broken pieces / haven't been so true
Leave me / in my barren world
When I try to give you all I hear the cry of love
There's no words and there's no time for
All the reasons why
I'm feeling empty inside
I see the heartache you hide in your eyes
I'm feeling empty inside
Shattered
I'm feeling empty inside
I see the heartache you hide in your eyes
I'm feeling empty inside
Shattered
Spoken word Yellow walls / I light another cigarette
Rainbow dreams crossing through my eyes
Shattered pictures in my mind
Love lost / lorn
Shattered / shattered / shattered / yeah
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Two can be as bad as one
It's the loneliest number since the number oneuh
No is the saddest experience that you'll ever know
Yes it's the saddest experience you'll ever know
Cause one is the loneliest number / that you'll ever do
One is the loneliest number / wouldn't work for two
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
It's just no good anymore since you went away
Now I spend my time / making rhymes of yesterday
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
It's just no good anymore since you went away
 One is the loneliest number
 One is the loneliest number
 One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
 One is the loneliest number
 One is the loneliest number
 One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do
Tried to go to sleep last night
But too many things were in my head
Then the sun began to rise
Still I haven't gone to bed
Why do all these questions dance around inside my head
All I want to do is close my eyes and go to bed
Let tomorrow bring the answers that I need instead
And let it go / let it go
Is there anybody Who Believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
Set me free / set me free
Hope that I can sleep tonight
Close my eyes and slip away
Dream about some other place
Where the sun shines in my head
Out of all the people in my life I love you more
And I hope that time will find a way to make it sure
That we stay one and the same
Is there anybody Who Believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
Set me free  Set me free
You're the only person in my life
And I hope that time will find a way to make it right
And whatever happens you will know
I love you more
Is there anybody Who Believes
That the questions and the answers will come easily
And this sadness that I felt will finally set me free
Set me free / set me free
Can you see the soul / through a window in your mind
Can you see the darkness that was left me over time
Bordering on sadness / no tranquility
Look through my mirror and you'll see
 A vision come and gone
 Nothing was clear
Saving grace / Forgotten road
I was lost / but now I'm home
Saving grace / a ray of hope
When I hear a Voice of the Soul
Sold my religion / sold my candles too
Knees have been bleeding / praying over you
I search the heavens / all I ever see
Dust from the ashes / misery
 Sleeping with misfortune
 A mirror of myself
Saving grace / Forgotten road
I was lost / but now I'm home
Saving grace / a ray of hope
When I hear a Voice of the Soul
When the light shines above me
And casts a shadow of myself
Look to skies that surround me
Embrace the one that speaks inside
Delivered unto self
Saving grace a ray of hope
When I hear the voice 
Saving grace
When I hear the voice
Hear the Voice of the Soul
There's a girl next door with a leather coat
And she looks pretty good to me
My friends all say that you better watch out
There's a side of her you haven't seen
Still I took a ride / it was late at night
We were cruising along on her motorbike
Everything was right / til Crazy Mary went down
So let me tell you about Mary
 Crazy Mary Goes Round
Let me tell you about Mary
 Crazy Mary Goes Round and round
Round and round
Called my doctor and I tried to explain
Cause it didn't make sense to me
Seven different sides and I've seen them all
One for everyday of the week
She gave me a scare / she was combing her hair
A long conversation there was nobody there
Does anybody know / what Mary's talking about
So let me tell you about Mary
 Crazy Mary Goes Round
Let me tell you about Mary
 Crazy Mary Goes Round
So let me tell you about Mary
 Crazy Mary Goes Round and round
Round and round
 Crazy Mary Goes Round
Funny thing about Mary
 Crazy Mary Goes Round and round
Round and round
Round and round
Upside down
You  you took me to a place I'd never been
High  much higher than before
Now  the vision of you haunting me again
Your spirit chills me to the core
Sing to me / Your twisted melody
Mesmerized / It never seems to end
Another Haunted Lullabye
I don't know the reason or the rhyme
Another Haunted Lullabye
Steal away the cradle in my mind
Gone  and left me with insatiable desire
Still  I can't escape your trance
Take  your pleasure when you play with my lament
You cast a shadow bound romance
Sing to me / Your symphony of woe
Deafening / oh will it ever end
Another Haunted Lullabye
I don't know the reason or the rhyme
Another Haunted Lullabye
Steal away the cradle in my mind
I can't stand the way your silence leaves me broken
And my loneliness is playing on the strings of my despair
Another Haunted Lullabye
I don't know the reason or the rhyme
Another Haunted Lullabye
Steal away the cradle in my mind
I lit a candle in your honor today
Prayed for forgiveness for the things that I said
And now I wake up and see I was wrong
All those years wasted / now come and gone
How many years have I been this way
The lines grow deeper / time fades away
Now etched in stone don't have the strength anymore
To break down these walls again
I lit a candle In Your Honor today
Everything will come around again
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around again
Now I see you on the other side
Sunshine raining down upon your face
You look so beautiful that place where you live
You walk among your dreams we talked about
So I stand here and I stare
In my garden of neglect
Never noticed it before
That it's winter all the time
Was too busy staring at
Your garden that you grew in time
I can see it took a lot of years
Your colors fill my mind
I lit a candle In Your Honor today
Everything will come around again
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around again
Even though the years keep passing / I reflect
About the one I truly loved and pushed away
Suddenly I stop and feel
That winter rain I know so well
And close my eyes
Wish you all the best
And you never know
I lit a candle In Your Honor today
Everything will come around
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around
I lit a candle In Your Honor today
Prayed for forgiveness for the things that I said
And you never know that maybe someday
Everything will come around
There's no reason you can't understand me now
There's no point in living up among the clouds
Tiny innuendos circling your mind
Come to find out you've been left so far
Left so far behind
And all the time you thought it's turning out so well
You turned your back on me
And wished me straight to hell
That's where I'll go if you want me to
I'll see you there
I'll see you there when your life is through
I'll see you there
Soaring higher now you're bound to come unglued
You're supported by a love that was untrue
Write your story on a single grain of sand
Heed the warning when you let go
Let go of my hand
A promised kiss upon your lips for not to tell
You turned your back on me
And wished me straight to hell
That's where I'll go if you want me to
I'll see you there
I'll see you there when your life is through
I'll see you there
So write your story on a single grain of sand
Heed the warning when you let go
Let go of my hand
A promised kiss upon your lips for not to tell
You turned your back on me
And wished me straight to hell
That's where I'll go if you want me to
I'll see you there
I'll see you there when your life is through
I'll see you there
That's where I'll go if you want me to
I won't care
I'll see you there when your life is through
I'll see you there
I'll see you there
Life is a mystery
Leaves me no consolation
Life fades like distant waves
Return again
No need to hide
Soon you'll be born again
A new chance to live
And walk that road to the end
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
Now I surrender the day
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
And I hope that you feel the same
Love is a mystery
That gives up no secrets
Embraces everyone
No hesitation
We try to find religion
How many books can we read
We look for love and romance
How hard can it be
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
Now I surrender the day
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
And I hope that you feel the same
In a way  we lost our innocence
In a day  we'll walk that road to the end
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
Now I surrender the day
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
In the way I look at you
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
I can feel that there's been a change
It must be the sign of the times how I feel
And I hope that you feel the sameSit there thinkin'
In your room
You feel the pressure
You're goin' crazy too
The walls around you
Closin' in
You need a change
Claustophobic
Feelin' scared
You need somebody
But no one seems to care
A one way ticket
A change of pace
You've had enough
Can't take no more
Breaking the chains around you
Nobody else can bind you
Take a good look around you
Now you're breaking the chains
Got this letter
Came today
From my baby
Who left me yesterday
Said she loves
She'll come back
She wants to try
I won't let her
She'll be upset
I know it's better
Than somethin' I'll regret
She's been dishonest
And insincere
I lost my mind
Twenty times a year
Breaking the chains around me
Nobody else can bind me
Take a good look around me
Now I'm breaking the chains
Woke up today
I'm alone
I look around
But baby you were gone
But I don't mind
And I don't worry
I will survive
I'm alone
Now that you're gone
Don't need nobody
To hold or tie me down
I broke the chains
So let me be
I've gotta be free
This town I'm in can't take no more
Decadance and sin
You were my woman
Why'd you have to be so hard and cold
Paris is burning
Want to see it from afar
Paris is burning
Want to get to where you are
My life's in ruin
The girl I love
She's far away
The distant fire
Brings memories of the love
That I once knew
Where are you now
Been looking all around
And I can't stay
Help me now
I can't stay
Much more before I fade away
Paris is burning
I can see it from afar
Paris is burning
Wanna to where you are
I can't believe
You'd throw it all away
You know you played me for a fool huh
I'm leavin' now
This time you know
That I'll be gone for good yeah
Paris is burning Paris
Paris is burning
Paris is burning
I can see it from afar
Paris is burning
Paris 
You weave your spell
Your eyes beckon me
Your lips they speak lies and misery
I know it's wrong but I can't turn away
The flames draw near they're telling me to stay
Into the fire I'm falling
Into the fire I'm falling
Into the fire
Your love burns bright and yet the flames are cold
This time I fear you won't be back no more
When will it end your love consumes my soul
Into the fire I'm being tempted once more
Into the fire I'm falling
Into the fire I'm falling
Into the fire
Take me back whera I came back
Don't wanna see your face no more
You broke my heart now it's not the same
I'm falling again
I'm falling again
Into the FIRE
I should'a known better
Should'a seen right thru
Over and over falling in love with you
Wanting you for myself my first mistake
Finding out the hard way
Was all that I could take
You were just using someone
And I was the one
She said You just got lucky
I believed your deadly lies
You just got lucky
You're a devil in disguise
Don't wanna hear no lies no apologies
Imagination gets the best of me
I'm looking everywhere still I see your face
I'll never forget you you put me in my place
You were just using someone
And I was the one
She said You just got lucky
I believed your deadly lies
You just got lucky
I've been hypnotized
She said You just got lucky
I believed your deadly lies
You just got lucky
You're a devil in disguise
Now that is over and I've seen right through
Not looking back again I'll start anew
Was making love to you such a wasted time
Maybe I love you still I'll get you off my mind
You were just using someone
And I was the one
She said You just got lucky
I believed your deadly lies
You just got lucky
I've been hypnotized
She said You just got lucky
I was taken by surprise
You just got lucky
You're a devil in disguise
I'd like to see you in the morning light
I'd like to feel you when it comes tonight
Now I'm here and I'm all alone
Still I know how it feels
I'm alone again
Tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you
I said stay but you turned away
Tried to say that it was me
Now I'm here and I've lost my way
Now I know how it feels
I'm alone again
I
Desperate living driving me mad
Writings on the wall
Crushed all our hopes and the dreams we once had 
Just to watch them fall
Tearing it up in the daytime
Burning it down at night
How long does it take
To break the spell
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail
Last generation reckless and free
Up against the odds
Thoughts of revenge are going through me 
Fate lies in the cards
Tearing it up in the daytime
Burning it down at night
How long does it take
To break the spell
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail
Desperate living trying to see
Breaking all the rules
Only the strong are gonna be free
From a world of fools
Tearing it up in the daytime
Burning it down at night
How long does it take
To break the spell
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail
How long does it take
To break the spell
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail
Tooth and Nail
Tooth and Nail
Straight to the top
Tooth and Nail
Clouds roll by as I look to the sky
And then the feeling comes it comes on again
You know desire burns like a fire fire of sin
Oh will I ever learn
You're the only one I would call my own
But then the shadows fall and I'm gone again
I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for the things
That I might never find again
Care for you you know that I always will
I know it's hard for you my taste for the kill
But then it calls to me when the moon rises full in the sky
You know it's not denied
Will I ever find love and peace of mind
On these streets again will it ever end
I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for the things
That I might never find again
You know desire burns like a fire fire within
I guess I'll never learn
You're the only one I would call my own
But when the shadows fall you know I won't be wrong
I'm a hunter
Searching for love
On these lonely streets again
I'm the hunter
Searching for the things
That I might never find again
I'm a hunter
Searching for love
I'm the hunter
Searching for the things
That I might never find again
Toss and turn all night in the sheets
I can't sleep
Night after night don't know what it means
In my dreams
What can I say or do
You won't come back we're through
I've realized too late
That baby your love has turned away
In my dreamsit's still the same
Your love is strong it still remains
In my dreamsyou're still by me
Just the way it used to be
Calling your name but you're turning away
Please don't leave
Running in circles waiting to see you
In my dreams
What can I say or do
You won't come back we're through
I've realized too late
That baby your love has turned away
In my dreamsit's still the same
Your love is strong it still remains
In my dreamsyou're still by me
Just the way it used to be
In my dreamsit's still the same
Your love is strong it still remains

And in my dreamsYou'll always be

In my dreamsyour love is strong
In my dreamsYou're still the same
In my dreams
Told you I had to leave I had my reasons
I said that it hurt to stay the way that I'm feelin'
It's not love
That left you standin'
It's not love
That left you cold
It's not love
Misunderstandin'
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take
Why baby why did you make me let you go
And leave you so lonely
Why baby why did you have to hold on
You know it's not love anymore
Gave you your last chance but you didn't believe me
You can't keep me satisfied the way that you treat me 
It's not love
That left you standin'
It's not love
That left you cold
It's not love
Misunderstandin'
Only a mistake
There's nothing left to take
Why baby why did you make me let you go
And leave you so lonely
Why baby why stop playing with my heart
I told you
It's not love
Telling you to be this way
It's not love
Sayin' you can never change
It's not love
When I told you
Is he putting you down
Down down down
I lie awake and dread the lonely nights
I'm not alone
I wonder if these heavy eyes
Can face the unknown
When I close my eyes I realize
You'll come my way
I'm standing in the night alone
Forever together
With the dream warriors
Don't wanna dream no more
With the dream warriors
And maybe tonight
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
I feel the touch comin' over me
I can't explain
I hear the voices callin' out
Callin' my name
It's the same desire to feel the fire
That's comin' your way
I'm standing in the night alone
Forever together
With the dream warriors
Don't wanna dream no more
With the dream warriors
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
With the dream warriors
Ain't gonna dream no more
And maybe tonight
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
Sweet revenge the bitter end
This time
Break the spell of illusion
Bound together waiting for you
Dream warriors
Don't wanna dream no more
With the dream warriors
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
With the dream warriors
Ain't gonna dream no more
With the dream warriors
And maybe tonight
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
Dream warriors
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
Dream warriors forever
Dream warriors
Maybe tonight you'll be gone
Dream warriors
Never thought our love would last
For so long
Time and time again
I thought that you would be gone
Still we kept love hanging on
I guess it's meant to be
That your heart still belongs to me
And now we've stood the test of time
We survived
I asked for hope and a chance
You gave the key to your heart
You used to say that I'm not sincere
I'm gonna prove that you're wrong
I'm never gonna leave your arms
Should've realized before
Your love's worth waiting for
Don't you know that
It's our love that's burning
Burning like a flame
And you know that
It's out love that's never gonna change
'Cause every time I touch you
You just make me go insane
Don't you know that
It's our love that's burning
Our love burning like a flame
Like a fantasy in the dark
You were gone
I couldn't say the words
That you wanted to hear
But baby now that I see the light
I feel it's burning so bright
So let's stop wasting all this time
Should've seen it all before
Our love's worth waiting for
Don't you know that
It's our love that's burning
Burning like a flame
And you know that
It's out love that's never gonna change
'Cause every time I touch you
You just make me go insane
Don't you know that
It's our love that's burning
Our love burning like a flame
Should've seen it all before
Your love's worth waiting for
Don't you know that
It's our love that's burning
Burning like a flame
And you know that
It's out love that's never gonna change
'Cause every time I touch you
You just make me go insane
Don't you know that
It's our love that's burning
Our love burning like a flame
Our love never gonna change
There seems no justice
When you fall in lve
It gives you blindness
When you are the one
The one that's hurting
'Cause they got the gun
There seems no justice
When you fall in love
Save me
Dont let me fall
Heaven sent
I heard the call
Stop me
Dont let me go
Touch my heart
Then let me know
Heaven sent
Thought you would set me
Heaven sent
Thought it could never be
Heaven sent
If I had only seen
That you were burning the fire in me
You took passion
Most of my soul
But I will come back baby
Stronger than before
Take my feelings
Leave me in pain
I will forget you
One of these days
Stop me
From feeling this way
Heaven sent
You drive me insane
Hold me
Dont let me go
Touch me now
Then let me know
Heaven sent
Thougth you would set me free
Heaven sent
Thought it could never be
Heaven sent
If I had only seen
That you were burning the fire in me
Passion burned
I felt the fire
Touch my soul
I felt desire
Now I see
Where we went wrong
Am I to blame
I've fallen in love
Passion burned
I felt the fire
Touch my soul
I felt desire
Now I see
Where we went wrong
Heaven sent
But you're not the one
Heaven sent
Thought you would set me free
Heaven sent
Thought it could never be
Passion burned
I felt the fire
Heaven sent but baby you're not the one
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
I felt the fire
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
Heaven sent
Heaven sent but baby you're not the one
A faded picture from your heart
Was all you left for me
I'm still waiting stanging here
To see what I could see
Your love i borrowed just like time
It wasn't mine to keep
But the love we shared
I thought was there
And now you have to leave
Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say I'm sorry
But I can't find a way
To just walk away
Couldn't see for i was blind
The hurt you hide inside
I didn't mean to break your heart
I wish it had been mine
And as another day unfolds
Don't know what it means 
Was it love we had
Or love gone bad
Still the love we need
Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say I'm sorry
But I can't find a way
To just walk away
I'm still standing waiting here
Waiting for a sign
I didn't mean to break your heart
I wish it had been mine
Just walk away
There'll be no more tomorrows
Just walk away
You won't be there for me
From far away
I tried to say I'm sorry
But I can't find a way
To just walk away
Just walk away
Yeah walk away
Just walk away
Look inside my eyes
You can see everywhere I've been
You can drag me down I'll come right back again
You gotta hold on to every little thing
Every little bag of bones
When the love's gone you shoot from the hip 
You make or break it on your own
Love takes your heart away and gives it back in pieces
I look at myself and say Now all I have to say
is'I know who to believe in'
Mirror mirror on the wall
I'm still here I survived it all 
Mirror mirror tell me more
If that was love then love is war
I am gonna fight until I win
Another place in time I might have given in
We sold our sons and we sold our daughters
Pretty soon we'll sell our brothers
We took the gold but the gold was water
I tried to save the world but I failed her
She cries the tears that I never left her
I left them all behind
You were sitting in your darkest hour
Summer's gone
We tried to make the world so much better
We send our words in a pretty perfumed letter
You sit alone in your ivory towers
I'm just one person I don't matter
You tap the needle and you went to heaven
You left it all behind
Now you're feeling oh so better
Too high to fly
You should've seen me there Yeah
Too high to fly my baby
But you were almost there
The sun shines down on my face
But you don't feel a thing no no no
The lines on the street and the some rises
You looked too long for heaven now you're blinded baby
Another morning sun
Another day gone by
The storm's coming
With the pouring rain
The storm comes with the pouring rain Salvation
The lines in the street and the smoke rises
Wanderin' round for forty days hope you find it
Am I here
to walk
alone
Am I here
to walk
alone
Am I here
to walk
alone
Am I here
to walk
alone
Am I here
here to walk
alone
Am I here

alone
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain
you are not worth to know to feel to see
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain
you are not worth to know to feel to see
Through tunnels of misunderstandings you all crawl
never will you be able to see the other side of the grey rain

By the first rays of dawn I rise up by the cold morning light
And I'm on my way
Soon the sound of my horse will be breaking the silence of a  brand new day
No one can see my face as I hide in the dark of my jet black cloak
Nor a man or a child could ever know why I ride by their homes
For I bring the truth to all who will
Be wise enough to hear the words I speak
But no one seems to believe
Call me madman I bring you madness
Call me seer I bring you fears
I am the Messenger I am the messenger
No one believes but I speak the truth
Tragedy is what all mankind will surely reach It's meant to be
Hear my words I warn you all of the coming end  you must believe
For I received a gift of prophecy
A mission I must fulfil Chosen to bring the word that no man will believe
Call me madman I bring you madness
Call me seer I bring you fears
I am the Messenger I am the messenger
No one believes but I speak the truth
Every day life is passing me by
Far away I long for the day I will finally
Find peace from all this refrain
But now I must ride on my way
Call me madman I bring you madness
Call me seer I bring you fears
I am the Messenger I am the messenger
No one believes but I speak the truth
I am the Messenger I am the messenger
You will believe when death reaps you all
I talk to the tempest in front of me
Facing her dark deep eyes I am ready to scream
Into her stormy eyes My fears I behold
Terror will strike me down to the floor
Over and over I long for the day
When I can find the meanings of my life
I descend into the maelstrom of my darkest side
No one can hear me while I ask aloud to the face of this horror
What does it take to be a man harder than before
to cry your tears and not afraid to let them show
What does it take to face your inner demons with no words left untold
What does it take to be a stronger man when the Tempest in raging on
What does it take to be a real man
Tempest calling now
I talk to the Tempest for the last time
Standing in front of her my arms open wide
She opens her jaws now and flashes her teeth
Son it's my turn now to speak
Over and over day after day
I fed on the power of your inner self
I am the maelstrom of your darkest side
I have no answer and you will not care
When I will crash you and wipe you away
What does it take to be a man harder than before
to cry your tears and not afraid to let them show
What does it take to face your inner demons with no words left untold
What does it take to be a stronger man when the Tempest in raging on
What does it take to be a real man
Tempest calling now
Everything changes and all stays the same
Don't look for a reason it doesn't matter anyway
You must face the Tempest don't try to step aside
When the storm rages harder it's your time to fight
What does it take to be a man harder than before
to cry your tears and not afraid to let them show
What does it take to face your inner demons with no words left untold
What does it take to be a stronger man when the Tempest in raging on
What does it take to be a real man
Tempest calling now
Tempest Calling
Slowly she moves through the willows
Silent she reaches for the boat
She has a sad lovely face
She is the Lady of Shalott
Sail on
When the mirror is cracking and the white mist surrounds her
All things must go all things must go
A new journey's beginning to a new way of being but
All things must go all things must go
She will walk in the sunlight and be free from her burden and
All things must go all things must go
But it's time to set sails in a mystical journey when all things must go
The Queen of Light appears
High on the distant shore
And as I breathe my very last second
She parts the darkness with her hand
The spiral passage of Time is moving
Silent through the galaxy
And she who controls all our destinies
In her hands she holds the spirits of kings
If I could do it all over again
I guess I would do it just the same
All life is formed and reformed again
I finally found my Holy Grail reaching the
Portal of Infinity open wide to let my spirit in
Portal of Infinity take me back to where all life begins
Never to look back never to feel pain again
Forever to live
Never to look back never to feel pain again
Forever free
I've finally find my way back home  Infinity
I've finally find my way back home  Eternity
I've finally find my way back home  Infinity
I've finally find my way back home
reunited with myself
Portal of Infinity open wide to let my spirit in
Portal of Infinity take me back to where all life begins
Portal of Infinity now I know what I find on the other side
Portal of Infinity by this blinding light a new legend is born
Never to look back never to feel pain again
Forever to live
Never to look back never to feel pain again
Forever free
I've finally find my way back home  Infinity
I've finally find my way back home  Eternity
I've finally find my way back home  Infinity
I've finally find my way back home reunited with myself
I am the one and only man who can lead you to the secret gates
I know the way to burn them down
With my return I will bring doom to them all
A Dreaming City ruled the world arrogant men acting like gods
They played with life and death for ten thousand years
A court of ghosts in marble halls dance at the sound of death's call
In mind and spirit they're already dead
And so I take my life in my hands make my own decision
I will embrace my Fate
So I stand
I stand  I stand over my fears
I stand  Wipe away all my tears
I stand  for what is right to be done
After the fall  I stand alone
I am the one and only man who can lead you to the secret gates
This game of pride has gone too far I lived my life as an outcast
And so I took my life in my hands made my own decision
did what was right to be done
My Fate fell upon me but now I rule my destiny
As King of Ruins at last
I stand
I stand  I stand over my fears
I stand  Wipe away all my tears
I stand  for what is right to be done
After the fall  I stand alone
When I long for the truth
When I search for my youth
That's when I call out your name inside myself
Deep inside I know there's something to relive
Day after day life can be so hard
I need the strength to carry on
That's when I wait for you to come back
 and turn wrong to right
With a word I'll be setting my spirit free
With a word I'll be where I am meant to be
And so I await for you to come back
Yes I await for the spirit to rise
Rise Rise
When I long for the truth
When I search for my youth
That's when I call out your name inside myself
Deep inside I know there's something to relive
Day after day life can be so hard
I need the strength to carry on
That's when I wait for you to come back and turn wrong to right
With a word I'll be setting my spirit free
With a word I'll be setting my spirit free
With a word I'll be where I am meant to be
With a word I'll be where I am meant to be
Ancient Spirit will rise right from my soul
Ancient Spirit will rise and sound a heavy tone
Ancient Spirit will rise from inside of me
Ancient Spirit will rise he will set me free
Ancient Spirit will rise Ancient Spirit will rise
There was a time was sang of battles won
Of golden kingdoms shining diamonds and pearls
Then suddenly all of these treasures turned to dust
Leaders of men bargain the glory of our past
And I can't explain the things I begged and borrowed
Now in front of me there's just a stale tomorrow
Domains were glittering like suns on windy seas
Amazing castles where the talent could be free
But now the same old games are blackening the sun
True art is buried by an army of onetrack minds
And I can't explain the things I begged and borrowed
And I don't want to live in a world so full of sorrow
A world with no tomorrow
A world so full of sorrow
A world without tomorrow
Ancient Spirit will rise right from my soul
Ancient Spirit will rise and sound a heavy tone
Ancient Spirit will rise from inside of me
Ancient Spirit will rise he will set me free
Ancient Spirit will rise
my Ancient Spirit will guide me right to the end of time
And I wait for this moment to come for all my life
My Ancient Spirit will rise
I want to climb the highest peaks of the Universe
To reach the tallest mountains of the moon
I set my soul on fire transcend this world of nothing
Imagination running mad to the extreme
I want to fly on the wings of the Firebird
I need to burn the distance leave this old world below
My flesh is soon consumed in a crazy smoke
And endless source of power eternal fire I'm breathing
My voice as a burning tongue the sun is licking
So I summon the fire elementals the ones I'm keeping inside
I call for my imagination to rise and shine to make my life
Burn Burn The tempest of fire is cleansing my soul
Burn Burn The wind of volcano is scorching my core
You can not stop me when I'm flying high and
Higher on the wings of the Firebird
So I summon the fire elementals the ones I'm keeping inside
I call for my imagination to rise and shine
to awake and make my life
Burn Burn The tempest of fire is cleansing my soul
Burn Burn The wind of volcano is scorching my core
You can not stop me when I'm flying high and
Higher on the wings and
Burn Burn The tempest of fire is cleansing my soul
Burn Burn The wind of volcano is scorching my core
You can not stop me when I'm flying high and
Higher on the wings of the Firebird
I'm turning back the Wheel of Time
to try to steal some more
Of passing hours days and nights now precious as bright gold
And as the Wheel is moving slowly in never ending grind
The time has come to make the change as things are bound to die
Oh I just have to light the darkness of my soul
So I can find a place to hide and reach my final goal
Forget the life I led so far and leave it all behind
And in the dawn of a million stars who knows what I will find
In another time in another place in another space
In another time in another place in another space
Lake comets fighting in the sky a blast of shining stars
Two different souls collide at last to reunite as one
I'm heading back into future time to find where I belong
The Wheel will end his final turn I complete my return
Oh I just have to light the darkness of my soul
So I can find a place to hide and reach my final goal
Forget the life I led so far and leave it all behind
And in the dawn of a million stars who knows what I will find
We live through space and time
We want more life and time
We want more more more
By the sacred laws of nature I am damned
By the Highest Court I was found guilty
Unforgiving judgement I could not escape
Terrible the curse cast upon me
No one can or will know the answer
why on the horizon I ride
Sky Rider  let my fire rip the darkest night
Ghost Rider  for eternity condemned to ride
Sky Rider  for my sins my spirit stays earthbound
Hell Rider  thundering my way across the sky
No one can stand in my way
No one can lay my remains in sacred ground to rest
If there is a heaven I could not be more far from it
If there's really a hell I'll be glad to reach it
For everywhere I go all I bring is misery
I can not be granted my passage to a new life
No one can or will know the answer
why on the horizon I ride
Sky Rider  let my fire rip the darkest night
Ghost Rider  for eternity condemned to ride
Sky Rider  for my sins my spirit stays earthbound
Hell Rider  thundering my way across the sky
No one can stop me to ride
No one can lay my remains in sacred ground to die
No one will know the answer
No one can see the way to set my soul free
I'm forever bound to be
Sky Rider  let my fire rip the darkest night
Ghost Rider  for eternity condemned to ride
Sky Rider  for my sins my spirit stays earthbound
Hell Rider  thundering my way across the sky
No one can stop me to ride
No one can lay my remains in sacred ground to die
What will you say when you reach your moment
Meanings are really hard to find
To look for a way or a reason to be alive
How can you win when all things around you will be gone
I just want to know why
I just want to know how
I just got to know why
So tell me how the Mighty have fallen
How could they fail as they reached for the stars
Tell me how the Mighty have fallen
How could they fail as they reached for the perfect sunrise
They just left their dreams behind
Guardian angels have been left abandoned
When everything is said and done
in the land of the of the brightest sun
Look for new hopes or dreams to conquer
How can you see them while you live for the day
You will find during the endless sleepless night
Hopes are the things that will help you to light up the darkest life
How could you leave them all behind
Tell me how the Mighty have fallen
How could they fail as they reached for the stars
Tell me how the Mighty have fallen
How could they fail as they reached for a future so bright
They forgot their dreams behind
Don't you ever forget to follow your heart
Look inside yourself and regain what you lost
I Once They Were Invincible a jig
Don't you ever forget the beautiful things you did and
felt during your life your loved ones and the dreams
you had They will give you the strength to carry on
and finally reach the brightest sun Just remember
the Ones who onces were invincible and celebrate them
for the inspiration they gave for your own life
Never forget your beautiful moments
They'll give you strength to carry on
to reach the land of the brightest sun
Think of the Ones who once were invincible
And celebrate what they meant for your life
You will find you will find
Everyday everyday
New hopes for you to regain How could you leave them all behind
I want to know how could you leave them all behind
So tell me how the Mighty have fallen
How could they fail as they reached for the stars
Tell me how the Mighty have fallen
How could they fail as they reach for the stars
Tell me how the Mighty have fallen
How could they fail as they reach for the sky
Tell me how the Mighty have fallen
I just want to know how can you live your life
If you don't keep your dreams aliveRunning through the night
And it drives me down
I deceide to take control in your mind
Waiting for the start 
I swear to reach tour heart
The master of your freedom and your pride
I will take you away my love
And you'll see a salvation around you
Ride the light ride the dark
Will you have me inside you 
I love you
Runaway is the only way
Runaway you cannot stay
Running through the night
I can bring you the light
I deceide to take control in your mind
For you I will fight
And I am on your side
Give me your soul
And take fight
All I want
To lick your skin
To kiss your eyes
And touch your heart 
All I want is simple thing
I have to see you by my side
All I want  your lovely lips
To suck your tongue in tender fear
All I want is you my dear
Inside your look I see my tear
Something in your eyes  it makes me sad
Your shameless smell so bravely near
Exciting whispers in my head
All I want is what I hear
All I want is you my dear
Oh my love you are so near
All I have is angels' grace
I have to kiss your perfect facei swallow the sun
i`m from the beginning of time
now all hope is gone

i'll everything change to my favour
and your light will fade

you did not care that my children died

you gave no heed to my sufferingnow you lost
so die i'll simply crush you
die i'll swallow the whole sun
die i will destroy you
so die you've forfeited your life

this is a giant war
the roahr of guns  near and far
this is only moral rot
guts collapse by one shot
truthfully burden
so many losses to bear
it hurts forever
we still have so much to fear
this is a giant war
the roahr of guns  near and far
this is only moral rot
guts collapse by one shot
Prophecy / Destiny
no time for peace  no hope
eternal war on the whole globe
if you make your final breath
even so what you see you should believe
raw roaring with angry breath
the sea is calling me to herself
i ignored her signs
now i shoud be destroyed
lifelong suffer dreadfull damnation
she is calling me
hear the wrecked sea
now she's calling me
she wants me to pay back
by nautical rack
north  south  east  west
goodes of the tides ebb and flow
escort him to his end
now i will show you what it means to deceive me
goddes of the tides
goddes of the tides
Give me wings like the birds that rule the sky Give me hope so I can leave this emptiness behind I've been lost I want to be found so angels save my soul from this pain and let my life not be in vain I've tried to find a place where I belong but I've had no luck so
now I want to be gone There's a place I wish to go and things I wish to see but being here on earth isn't where I want to be I need a new life somewhere far away with you I want to be up there in the sky so please God give me a sign make the angels come down and
pick me up I need to be with you I need to see the stars from above
Leave me in despair with all my dreams withering Tie me to the air so I float away shivering So please help me as I find my way I need a place to rest my feet I've been wandering for days Nights so cold left alone never knowing where to go Nights so dark I
need a spark to light the road to lead the way I need you more than ever right now Please don't let me down I put my faith in you and yet here I am lost and alone There's nowhere else to go I'm here for good Lost alone forgotten There's nowhere else to go
Free my soul so I can finally escape this place
Waking up gets harder every day the face that I see is not who I want to be It's hard to find comfort in things that I regret because there's things in my life that I wish I could forget So now I find myself retracing my steps This journey I have taken has taught
me many things you have to have faith in all that you do and I know he's watching over you You are never alone This is when the battle begins this is when we prove our faith When all is lost and there's nothing left do you stand tall Give it all you got reach
down in your heart and put in everything you've got there's no time to leave anything behind this is your final calling This is your life live as you wish and leave nothing behind
There have been times when I feel this life is not worth my time When every breath that I take will just collapse my insides But I've come to realize that there is someone who will never let us down
Fly with me on my wings hold on tight while we soar these seas Search in your soul and find what you've been looking for Search in your soul and find your true potential We are meant to be so much more than skin and bones We are meant to be so much more We are
meant to be saviors No matter how hard you try you will never blind me I see my future and I go to it We all have our own purpose and mine is to save We all have our own purpose and mine is to save and mine is to save you Throw at me what you may I will never
back down Explore the unseen and all that's been lost along the way Tonight we rediscover what we buried long agoEste es el buitre no muerto

Ah ah the justice will be done at last
Ah who's gonna cry for you
Ah there's nothing you can do oh no
From the depths of the human mind
Mysteries that rule our lives
Are we free or slaves of faith
Good and evil walk side by side
Are we evil or divine
How can we purify our souls
Without being in total control
Our kind is being carved in blood
Are we blessed or are we cursed
How many secrets tell me father
Lie behind the seven sins
The world we live in is a nightmare
Or is just a crazy dream
Like a blind man lost in time
We could never see the light
We know what's right or wrong
But we're still singing the same old song
How many secrets tell me father
Lie behind the seven sins
The world we live in is a nightmare
Or is just a crazy dream
Wrath greed sloth pride lust envy gluttony
How many secrets tell me father
Lie behind the seven sins
The world we live in is a nightmare
Or is just a crazy dream
I'm praying lord to find a way
I'm struggling every single day
I know there must to be something better
Waiting for you
Waiting for me
Waiting for us
Life is not like it was supposed to be
It's hard and everyone can see
I know i know i know there must to be something better
Waiting for you
Waiting for me
Waiting for us
Learn from yesterday
Live for today
Pray for tomorrow my friend
There are many things i'd like to say

And then again i find myself on my knees
Praying for you

Learn from yesterday
Live for today
Pray for tomorrow my friend
That will be the day when all pain will fade away

Have you ever let the rain wash your tears away
Learn from yesterday
Live for today
Pray for tomorrow my friend
There's an angel in heaven
There's a voice inside my head
He's my hero forever
There is magic in the air
Like a light in the dark
Owner of a sacred heart
Bow to the king
Long live rock'n roll
Every time there's a rainbow
I can't help i start to cry
Every time there's a rainbow
I feel left on my own
There's no reason to cry
Cause his voice will never die
There'll be always a stage
But that's another page
Like a light in the dark
Owner of a sacred heart
Bow to the king
Long live rock'n roll
Every time there's a rainbow
I can't help i start to cry
Every time there's a rainbow
I feel left on my own
He's the king long live rock'n roll
Every time there's a rainbow
I can't help i start to cry
Every time there's a rainbow
I feel left on my own
He's the king
He's the king
He's the king long live rock'n roll
He's the king long live rock'n roll
The black smoke is clouding the sky
The flames are burning so high
So many lives are at stake
Hotter hotter than hell
Hotter hotter than hell
Here come the firemen
Ready to save as many as they can
Facing the fire risking their lives again
Heroes
They are true heroes
There is no price for saving a live
Will they back home tonight

Sounds like desparate shout
Every time the hear the bell

There is no price for saving a live
Will they back home tonight
Watch out
The roof is falling down
What's the sound
Sounds like desparate shout

It's never late to start again
Life can bring you down
Life can bring you down
Life can bring you down
I said life can bring you down
Lonely days and lonely life
Empty bottle another fight
Life has given him many scars
Spent some time behind the bars
Just a man with a pocket full of dreams
Just a man with his guitar
Another town another night
Another girl a broken heart
But he'll never be alone
He has his guitar
The stage is his home
Those magic fingers can make you cry all right
He can play the blues all night
He can rock and roll that's right
I wish everybody could understand
Those notes had so much to say
It came from the soul
It could never go wrong
He's been a drifter all his life
He's always following the gipsy road
Another town another night
Another girl another broken heart
But he'll never be alone
He has his guitar
The stage is his home
Those magic fingers can make you cry oh Oh
Yeah
He can play the blues all night
He can rock and roll that's right
He can play he can play the blues
He can rock and roll and he can blow you mind
That's right Oh Yeah
He keeps rocking and rolling all night
He keeps rocking
He keeps rolling all night
Oh All night
Here I go again
Every day is the same
Working like a slave
Time and time again
Stuck in the traffic jam
I am losing my mind
How could we complain
God how I miss those days
Innocence was left behind
Now I get insane
Thousands bills to pay
I wish I could go back in time
I'll never forget those days
Seems like yesterday
Out in the streets
Playing with the kids
Those were the best days of my life
Too much confusion
Too much pollution
Under pressure always late
This must be a joke
I'm about to have a stroke
I am losing my mind
I'll never forget those days
Seems like yesterday
Out in the streets
Playing with the kids
Those were the best days of my life
Those were the best days of my life
Those were the best days of my life
Lost in the dark
Alone in the night
Trying to find my way
Sirens and screams
A shot in the dark
Someone just lost his life
Such a bad dream
Shameful display
Of our sad society
There is no wrong place
There is no wrong time
I hope i get out alive
I couldn't believe my eyes
I couldn't believe it
A witness of one more cried
Is always a victim
I can't describe
That horrible sight
I couldn't help i cried
Violent end
Upon a poor soul
He paid the higher price
I couldn't believe my eyes
I couldn't believe it
A witness of one more cried
Is always a victim oh yeah
I couldn't believe my eyes
I couldn't believe it
A witness of one more cried
Is always a victim
If I were a Jedi
I'd respect all forms of life
If I were a Jedi
The force would be my ally
If I were a Jedi
I'd be the guardian of peace
If I were a Jedi
I'd protect the galaxy
May the force be with you
May the force be with you
Fear leads to anger
Anger leads to hate
Hate leads to suffering my friend
Once you start down the dark path
It will forever dominate your destiny
The Dark Side is seductive
Quicker and easier
May the force be with you
May the force be with you
Fight the Dark Side
May the force be with you
May the force be with you
May the force be with you
May the force be with you
Raise the Flag of War
Trample the banner of truce
Gather soldiers of fire
For we have been called
The ground shakes
Our enemies tremble
Stink of fear fills the air
SILENCE THE SHEEP BLEED THEM DRY
Fire and War consuming this earth
Immortal warriors bring death from beyond
After you die your corpses are burned
EXALTED INFERNAL LEGIONS
Hordes of death shall ride down upon you
Your fate is grim the end shall unfurl
Legions of the darkness with blackened wings
Your pathetic scream are in vain
Withered and decayed
Are the creatures of earth
Horror on faces of those torn apart
Blood is spilled ferocity unleashed
Fresh crimson to paint us for further battle
Invincible and ancient
They ride down from the sky
This world has fallen to those
Who dominate through fear
Authors of pain breeders of sorrow
Driven by suffering
Eyes filled with rage
Echoes of madness
Curse thy name for eternity
Standing defiant with fists to the sky
Hope fails and dies
In life as in death
Trampled and broken the weak will of man
Existence is nothing forgotten
Peace is no more as chaos ensues
The Cult of the Dragon
Black out the sky light exists here no longer
Feel the dragon's breath as we scorch the earth
Any hope of a future
BURNT BEFORE YOUR EYES
Nothingness prevails
OUR REIGN IS SUPREME
Eliminate your weakness
Proclaim our greatness
Tormented and cast away
Bleak is thy fate
Showered in darkness for eternity
Even your memory is gone
Closer and closer the spiral void comes
To bring your mind into madness
The blinding red and the piercing sounds
Tearing apart your subconscious
The maze set before you but nowhere to turn
As voices call you in from beyond
Twisted and evil powers unknown
Wrought with unrest and demonic intent
Archaic and ancient it beckons you
Creation of pain and infernal demise
No will to resist this consuming torture
Vortex of mental pain
As voices call you in from beyond
Confusion shall reign
You're wrought with unrest and demonic intent
Aggression takes over like a drug
Adrenaline rushing through
Intensity too strong to control
Fueling the need exciting the greed
Violence distorted reality
Seeing red clouded judgment
Feeding off your fear
Intensity too strong to control
Fueling the need exciting the greed
Bloodlust rage
Feeling your life struggle in my grasp
This is your end
Broken defeated
I WANT BLOODLUST RAGE
Nothing less than crushing your skull
There is no end
Blinded insane
I WANT MORE
AGGRESSION
VIOLENCE
INTENSITY
BLOODLUST
Sever your flesh
To bring you suffering
Torture you again and again
Your mind is lost
You are deformed beyond recognition
Searing heat
Cauterized wounds
The blood not yet spilled
Is soon to flow free
Screams of endless torment
In the end your worst dreams come true
The pain is gone and the memory fades
But it all starts over again
Beyond your death lies a realm of pain
Horror instilled as you depart from this world
A beast awaits to ravage you
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
Screams of endless torment
All shall turn a deaf ear
No one responds to your cries for help
Your body will be desecrated
Limbs are torn from your torso
Eyes gouged out toes removed
Skin is melting and peeled away
You are reduced to a bloody stump
Screams of endless torment
In the end your worst dreams come true
The pain is gone and the memory fades
Bu it all starts over again
Screams of endless torment
All shall turn a deaf ear
No one responds to your cries for help
Your body will be desecrated
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW
He cannot help you
All hope is lost
As your existence fades into nothing
A soul not worth saving in the eyes of the weak
Stronger than all of their fake beliefs
Reality crushing the hypocrisy
An unmoving stone in the path of the meek
Curse of salvation
I will never be saved
GROVEL FOR ME BASTARD SON
My hate will never fade
Your words do not move me
Your heaven I defy
My laws are my own
Your resurrection I deny
I obstruct your path to righteousness
I won't speak his name
Always one step ahead of you
But in your eyes left behind
A burning rage of immeasurable pain
Flows through my soul
Storms of darkness race through my mind
Visions of an ancient past encircle me
As I search for echoes of the future
Peace of mind will never be found
No one can appease my desires
So to my own self be true
AND TURN MY BACK TO HEAVEN
A thirst for vengeance is what keeps me alive
For I didn't choose this life
The pitiful ways of the human race
Have made me feel this contempt
Until my blood paints the ground
I will forever remain enwrapped
Within the shadows of eternal misery
We the lords of your dark destiny
Transparent and swift
Forever compelled towards the crushing darkness
Solemn and strong
NO ONE IS INNOCENT
NO ONE IS SAFE
SIN UNRELENTING
SIN JUSTIFIED
Secrets revealed from the past
Once thought to be lost for all time
Set in stone now to never be undone
Thy will be crushed and doomed
Those with power kept it locked inside
THE BLACK HEARTED HORDE
Never to tell of its hidden capacity
THE CULT OF THE DRAGON
Law over faith
Strength over ritual
Time grows short for all who defyWaiting for the night to fall
feeling only hunger
searching for a victim for the nightly kill
Only a shadow in the night
No one can see the evil
that lurks behind every step they take
The darkness within
Lives in the shadow zone
No place to run
You're trapped all alone
Fear Death Hate
Darkness within
Fear Death Hate
Running through the streets alone
he is drawing near
Right there behind you
Watching from high above
As the sun goes down
this creature controls you
The darkness within
Lives in the shadow zone
No place to run
You're trapped all alone
No place to run
Fear Death Hate
No way out
Fear Death Hate
The darkness within
Lives in the shadow zone
No place to run
You're trapped all alone
It seemed like a good idea at the time
A place no one could find
On the edge of town
No one could hear a sound
Almost like a hospital
But evil minds lurked within
conducting experiments
An exercise in sin
Too much power unchallenged control
Too much evil and a blackened soul
Like in 1983 Cult like mentality
Are you ready to fight for your life
are you ready to flee the dark
what's happening here is no dream
but a cold reality yeah
Devils in white heaven in black
Cross yourself now and never look back
Enter the gates of your biggest fear
Give praise to nothing as you enter here
This is the end of all you know
This is where your dreams come to die
There are no soul protectors
There are no angels in white
As they pound on your soul
Killing your will to fight
And there will be no defenders
There will be nothing but death
Breathing the poison gasses
As you die with the rest
The weight on your body to take another breath
Every moment a curse that fights your will of death
Were you the answer Or the question too
Who is the one when two ones equal two
Human perseverance a dangerous thing
You just want out to never feel another thing
Indoctrination isolation the cult of the one percent
Termination and extermination this machine must be fed
Launch the attack warfare burns the open skies
Gasoline death machines and men prepared to die
As we lift off high above the ground
From below the airraid siren calls
firewatchers wait tonight as burning shrapnel falls
Hide in shadows
Watch for anything that makes a sound
This burning hellfire
descends upon the ground
Under blackened skies
By the light of the moon
we are destined for victory or doom
Never be numbers
Under blackened skies
Never be shadows wearing a disguise
They are defenders
and they don't live in fear
they stand and fight as the enemy draws near
We choose our side and loyalties
We defend what belongs to us
We think not of the enemies
As we grind them into dust
We are the homeland forces
We do what must be done
We are few in number
Living and dying by the gun
Who are you to know the end
And why do you speak to us of death
Do you believe there is a god
And has he told you of his plan
Is all that you see
Part of the Divine
Is it hell for eternity
Is it a way to twist the lie
Is the end what you foresee
Preaching death unto the earth
Armageddon drawing near
Think you know what is to come
Those that listen live in fear
Truth fear
The prophecy is only lies
Truth fear
You're a savior in disguise
Truth fear
Don't believe the lies they bring
Truth fear
Gain your power from within
No place to hide
nowhere for you to run
only the end
waits for your life of constant lies
The time has come
For you to be found
guilty for your evil
time to be judged accordingly
Now no one cares
Take advantage of the weak
live off the suffering
of the fools your twisted truth
Distorted reality
You blindfolded all of them
No fear or conscience
An outcast you stand alone
Stand before him
Life will be judged
Stand before him
Life through Anubis eyes
No one here gets out alive
but no one lives in fear
of the sounds the way of life
the end that's drawing near
Rising Power Screaming sound
Constant chaos raining down
You're not coming back from here
This is where you stay
Now that you have made the choice
you do things our way
Rising Power Screaming sound
Constant chaos raining down
This is the chance prepare to fight
Fight
take no prisoners this is our life
As you count the dead
and see the suffering
no illusions now
your final day is here
Rising Power Screaming sound
Constant chaos raining down
This is the chance prepare to fight
Fight
take no prisoners this is our life
Like an angel cast from heaven
Like a demon takes to flight
feel the fury of the black top
as I speed across the night
Feel the howling of the pistons
like a banshee cast from hell
as I'm cutting through the night It bleeds
play the hand that I've been dealt
I see the evil out to get me
I won't give it half a chance
my burning soul will set the night aflame
like the devil's fiery dance
Can't stop me
Can't take me
Won't ever slow me down
Can't beat me
Won't defeat me
On this battle ground
Artificial starlight is dancing in the skies
falling from the heavens
the night is their disguise
they will walk among us
hidden deep within the crowd
they infiltrate and communicate
Their orders from the clouds
The blind and huddled masses
make for easy prey
never would they dream that their end
would come today
Some would form militias
while others went to ground
scattering like roaches
In some abandoned town
nothing could prepare us
for what we had to lose
the scourge is all around us
devouring what they choose
With perfect cold indifference
their armys raged and fought
the terror of the enemy
clouded every thought
The fires of humanity
arc cinders fading out
those who never cared to pray
were suddenly devoute
No time for warning
the weak will be enslaved
another frantic exodus
and no one can be saved
Their overwhelming power
their methods have evolved
their strength is not in numbers
but tactical resolve
In the cold light of morning
In some forsaken field
900 soles abandon
in the name of one ideal
Like some misguided prophet
A sheppard who chose to lead
Was this an act of protest
Or another darker deed
Oh greater one then us
Show us the way
path of no return ready to self destruct
obey your command
we are the lost
On the road straight to hell
Do the walls have eyes
Is the night alive
Is darkness just a shadow on the wall
was it easy to give up
was the power just too much
a mastermind in control of you
Falling and rising and
twisting and turning
crying and screaming and
dying and bleeding
Now feeling no pain
Now nothing remains
What motivates more than the promise
Is the promise of the end
the weak will be lead
into the darkness they are fed
No turning back when you've come this far
They will take your soul
and will twist your mind
and leave you where you areLove beyond death
Is nothing but life
Behold her
That solitary maiden
Dancing and singing
A melancholy strain
In a voice so thrilling
There is a charm unknown
I'm leaving my flesh
I'm leaving my soul
I see her eyes
I love her smile
Finally I know
She's mine
Breaking the silence
Of a thousand valleys
I have discovered
The magic in her voice
I have looked upon
That brilliant creature
And now
My heart is sore
Nothing
Lasts forever
We are bound
To die together
No
Il sole non e piû
L'ombra
Di un cielo senza te
Vedo
Il mare un po' piu blu
L'onda
Che vive dentro me
Piangono
Stele su di noi
Siamo soli
E dentro c'õ
Un calore che
Una luce
Muoiono
I sogni mentre noi
Siamo soli
E dentro c'õ
Una forza che
Un potere
Life
Is still in my mind
Is still in my soul
Is still in my flesh
I'm reborn
Because I lied
Because I cried
Because I lived
Because I die
Rot inside
Pain is high
As I die
No one cries
Rot inside
Back to life
As I die
You are mine
I said to my soul
Be still
And let the dark
Come upon you
I said to my soul
Wait
I said to my soul
Be still
And wait without hope
Wait without love
Wait
Vacant interstellar spaces
Dark the sun and the moon
Whisper of running streams
Winter lightning gloomy doom
Dark the sun
And the moon
Winter lightning
Gloomy doom
All I feel
Is a silent funeral
Nobody's funeral
For there is no one to bury
All I see is a frightened face
Nobody's face
For no one is waiting
No one but you
Mighty darkness
Just you
Oh mighty darkness
I'm one with you
Because where you are
Is where you are not
Delirium of lunatics and liars
Subjugated thought and will
Ages of death saturate their lands
For only one of their ways can be true
Foolish idols will mean nothing
When your planet is turned to ash
Every name once spoken in reverence
Devoured in global holocaust
Decay and nothingness
The only future that awaits
Withdrawal from Reality
Can't disguise your fear and hate
Following the path of deception
Embrace of darkness
Darkness eternal
Your paradise beyond
Is just an old hallucination
Misery and ignorance
Won't lead to your redemption
The light is an Illusion
Embrace of darkness
As the bodies pile higher
For your eversilent deity
Righteousness extinguished
Darkness reigns eternally
Rapture didn't come for you
So anxiously awaited
Nights spent in your coffins
Waiting to be taken
Earthly lives of no use
In the shadow of Armageddon
So eager for the promised lies
Led to your destruction
Doomed to be led  Like sheep to their end
Gather in your house of weakness
Welcoming the end of days
Insanity spills from your lips
As your church is set ablaze
Skyward cries asphyxiated
Clothes burn to your flesh
Consumed now in horrific pain
Only flames ascend
Succumb to your disease
Burning corpses on their knees
Bringer of apocalypse
Funeral pyre of holy flesh
Cremated deliverance
Incinerated faithful
Fire consumes your dreams of here after
Ignorant to the end
Burning in the hell you fear
You have been forsaken
Flesh is Melting  Flames are rising
Congregation  Immolated
What once was yours
I now have taken
Furnaces for mass cremation
Enforcers of depopulation
Vilified dehumanized
The weak and worthless sent to die
Easily manipulated
Herds and herds asphyxiated
Realization dawns at last
As their lungs are filled with gas
Industrial machinery
To maximise efficiency
Mass production genocide
Combustible subhumanity
Rendered into smoke and ash
Eternal stench of burning flesh
Smokestacks caked with carbonized fat
Renewing visions from the past
End of the line  The ovens await
Into the showers  The ovens await
Cleanse the plant clear the land
A scope that none can comprehend
Forcibly torn from your family
They are already up the chimney
Some are saved from termination
Tortures of experimentation
Labor forced until they drop
Corpses walk but not for long
For young and old  The ovens await
To the left and to the right  The ovens await
In this hole lives the wicked king
In darkness I emerge from filth and isolation
In my wake paranoia epidemic
Blood sprays as your brain is ventilated
Kill for my master  Random assassin
I am a monster  Kill for my Master
I turn children into killers
Turned into a killer I am the son
Blasted with my 44 if you catch my fancy
Smitten by a bloody hail of lead
Voices commanding  Kill for my master
Psychic Transmission  From ancient demons
Do you know my master
In this hole lives the wicked king
This night I emerge machine gun at the ready
To prey upon the panicstricken herd
You will spend all summer counting the bodies
Kill for my master
Kill
Prey is chosen this ride is her last
Overpowered she never had a chance
Now she's mine
There'll be no rejection this time
Suffocated feel her die beneath my hands
Willing now lying still as death
Now she'll stay
With the lifeless body have my way
Upon my knife to be killed and raped
Taken home her head and hands I amputate
Emiscerate
With her organs copulate
Flesh is sliced to be cooked and eaten
Dissection the body axed to pieces
In a mountain range
Buried in a shallow grave
Fulfilling dreams of mutilation
I take their lives  Fuck the dead
Eat their flesh  Chop off the head
Necrophile decapitator
Headless corpse I rape again
Disemboweled and dissected
Vanished to a gruesome end
Coming home a hammer to the skull
Slit ear to ear blood spurts from the jugular
Decapitated
Darts thrown at her severed head
Into the disposal hacked out vocal cords are shredded
So long suffered she finally lies beheaded
The slay her friend
I'll never hear them bitch again
Death almighty consume all life
Darkness will always conquer the light
Abolition of the lies  Beyond the unholy grave
Absolute supremacy  Worshippers of total death
Wreckers of Destruction  Worshippers of total death
Abject misery and pain for humanity
Suffering prolonged for eternity
Extermination revelry  War and sodomy forever
Genocide completion  Perish here forevermore
Spectacle of mass demise  Only death is real
Massacure torture catastrophe
Death's omnipotent certainty
Suns and men and gods succumb
Submerge the earth in corpses and blood
Ejaculation floods your rectum
As I slit open your abdomen
Organs fall out in a pile
As I pump your bowels full
Innocents lured to their doom
Immobilized and raped until death
Penetrate with flesh and blade
Hot blood helps to lubricate
Last breaths scream your agonies
Abused and ravaged anus bleeds
Severed breast carving flesh
Sodomized and Butchered
Sodomy  Butchery
Ejaculation floods your rectum
As I slit open your abdomen
Organs pulled out from within
Again I pump your bowels full
Rusty backsaw amputation
Sanguinary masturbation
Dismembered carcass sawn in half
Again I fuck your severed ass
Another slaughtered for my lust
Discarded flesh returns to dust
In the crawlspace decomposing
Sodomized and Butchered
Captive of sadistic hate  Suspended by the wrists
Powertool torture  Inflicted on your frail flesh
Tools of agony before you  Color drains from your face
To make you fucking suffer
Screaming as the carnage sprays
Blood shoots through the air  Grind down to the bone
Enduring levels of agony  Heretofore unknown
Violence and utter hatred  Only shreds of flesh remain
Bloodiest execution  Under the chainsaw
When the blood flows too freely
Blowtorch used to cauterize
So much more pain left to bestow
Before I let you die
Appalling mutilations  Chainsaw butchery
Pools of gore collecting  Mangled painfully
Drills descending toward you  Skin has no resistance
Holes punctured through your flesh
At the end of your existence
Mutilated heap of flesh
Sawn to pieces in a shower of gore
Abhor life beckoning death
Killing need bred into me
Scorn and misery all I've known
Feelings destroyed so long ago
Hunt and slaughter relentlessly
Others pain means nothing to me
Images in my head faces screaming
All life is dead to me see them bleeding
Twisted hate no one understands
Until butchered at my hands
Know my pain
The abyss behind my gaze
Absorb your frozen stare
I drain the life away
Tortured screams of dying
Echo through my head
Hacked to pieces
Disemboweled and mutilated
How many never found
Corpses buried and forgotten
Abhorred life bound for dust
Predestined misbegottenWhen will you wake up
Start to realize your life is just a fake
No real opinions just compromise
Your front's about to break
You're left you're right you're inbetween
Got nothing real to say yeahyeah
You live your life in a fantasy
It's the same thing every day
So listen up now little fool open up your eyes

You just see no evil hear no evil
Speak no evil you just dream evil
Dream evil So open up your eyes

Dream evil Dream evil You're just a lie
It's time to choose your side
We've come too far and here we draw the line
It's time to change the game
I refuse to follow and live my life in shame
You hide behind your lies
And we are paying with our lives
Demons running through your veins
A display of broken dreams
You are the poison
And we're the antidote
You try to choose our fate
And make us your powerslaves
You are the poison
And we're the antidote
You think you are divine
Ruins and death is what you leave behind
But now we know your name
I refuse to follow and live my life in shame
You hide behind your lies
And we are paying with our lives
Demons running through your veins
A display of broken dreams
You are the poison
And we're the antidote
You try to choose our fate
And make us your powerslaves
You are the poison
And we're the antidote
Your devilicious plan
It will never stand
Trying to hide us in your graves
Evil incarnate show your face
You hide behind your lies
And we are paying with our lives
Demons running through your veins
It all began that morning
When they came knocking on my door
They met my older brother who was weak
He was poor
He told them he believes in hell
And how they could be released
He asked them into our house
And called upon the beast
And the thunder rolled across the sky
And the wind picked up an evil cry
Can you feel it entering your mind
Now is the time for the devil's sign
Sin city sin city evil's all around
Sin city sin city burned down to the ground
Sin city sin city the flames will make you drown
Sin city sin city so pretty
The devil proved to be really nice guy
And they partied all night long
Thou who always believed in God
Admitted they were wrong
The beast was really satisfied
And with a big smile on his face
He suggested that they should continue
But bring the party to a hotter place
And the thunder rolled across the sky
And the wind picked up an evil cry
Can you feel it entering your mind
Now is the time for the devil's sign
Sin city sin city evil's all around
Sin city sin city burned down to the ground
Sin city sin city the flames will make you drown
Sin city sin city so pretty
The evil lives inside your mind
The evil lives inside your mind
The devil's giving you a sign
He wants to take you all away
In his flames we disappear
In his flames we disappear
We feel no pain
We feel no fear
Sin city sin city evil's all around
Sin city sin city burned down to the ground
Sin city sin city the flames will make you drown
Sin city sin city so pretty
You are the one you have no reason
You're like the sun you have no seasons
You're on your own
No one tells you what to do
Alone but strong
You know it's all up to you
But your world is all an illusion
Behind the mask you're a lie
You're a creature of the night
Seek your prey after sundown
You're a creature of the night
You lost control you're in denial
You sold your soul you are a liar
There's no return
You can't go back to what's been
Your soul will burn
Still you make sin after sin
Behind the mask you're a lie
You're a creature of the night
Seek your prey after sundown
You're a creature of the night
You're a creature of the night
Seek your prey after sundown
You're a creature of the night
I'm the path to destruction
I'm your every lie
I'm the road to salvation
That is why I hide
You will need me and I'll be gone
Forever in my claws
You'll beg but I will tear you down
Just scream my name
I'll take you to hell and back
You will play my game
And fall through the crack
Hellride  The ride of your life
Hellride  The ultimate price
Now you know why you're shaking
Why you're terrified
I will stop you from breaking
'Cause I need your life
Now you fear my name
We are going to hell and back
We are one and the same
As we fall through the crack
Hellride  The ride of your life
Hellride  The ultimate price
Keep the fire burning feed the flames
I will cleanse all worries no more pain
Just scream my name
I'll take you to hell and back
You will play my game
And fall through the crack
Hellride  The ride of your life
Hellride  The ultimate price
Hellride  The ride of your life
Hellride  The ultimate price  Hellride
You've come too far to see the light
The fear is now your master
So from this deep you try to climb
From pain and your disaster
Soon you will find your peace in the fire
Your desire so real
Take my hand
The demon yes I am
Come get your fix
Six hundred and 66
This is the point of no return
The gate to domination
Face the fear and let it burn
This is your salvation
Soon you will find your peace in the fire
Your desire so real
Take my hand
The demon yes I am
Come get your fix
Six hundred and 66
Down to zero seatbelts on
I hear the engine start
Leave the tower taking off
Good bye to ground control
I live my dream as I am leaving home
I spread my wings and fly away
Shooting through the night with balls on fire
Just like a bullet from a gun
Flying away into the night
Cruising the stars at speed of light
I do what I want I'm out of control
I know just how to start a war
I reach a planet it looks so nice
I want to set it down
But my ship is too big and I crush a home
And kill the emperor's wife
I take off right away I have to flee
I set my course right back to home
But I didn't see them following
They are coming for revenge
Flying away into the night
Cruising the stars at speed of light
I do what I want I'm out of control
I know just how to start a war
Taste the truth it's venomous
Sweet the taste of lies
Hide behind your ignorance
Belief is what you'll find
You gave your all and I was blind
Just lead the way and I will shine
Everything that's sane we leave behind
Now do the deed the murdered mind
Greet the foes with agony
Make them feel the rage
Let us spread this leprosy
All unites in hate
You gave your all and I was blind
Just lead the way and I will shine
Everything that's sane we leave behind
Now do the deed the murdered mind
I won't reveal what's underneath it is sacred
Don't try to help just let it sink
And drown in hatred
You gave your all and I was blind
Just lead the way and I will shine
Everything that's sane we leave behind
Now do the deed the murdered mind
The beer is cold the night is hot
This party's going on for weeks
But we don't seem to get enough
So tell your friends to get on board
Bring your daughter bring your wife
What's more important bring more booze
The neighbors threats to call the cops again
But we're too high to understand what they say
We're too high too loud too drunk too proud
All the girls they sing along
The stereo play our favorite song
The drumbeat rolling through the neighborhood
Don't you dare to fall asleep
Another drink is what we need
Metal warriors they will never kneel
The neighbors they have finally called the police
And they are welcome to our feast
'Cause we're high too loud too drunk too proud
One day we will have to surrender
We will have to grow up
But not yet we're still too young
And everybody wants to rock
'Cause we're high too loud too drunk too proud
'Cause we're high too loud too drunk too proud
It's after midnight the air is warm
Chrome reflects the starlight ignitions on
One by one the engines start
It's in our souls it's in our hearts
Hey you Twist the grip now here we go
Summer night a smell of gasoline
Feeling hiding riding with the wind
In moonlight a trip from town to town
Old school rules we are all blood bound
Me and my brothers travel with thunder
Iron horses we ride
Friday night the engines roar
44 riders ride until the dawn
Friday night the engines roar
44 riders ride until the dawn
On the road is where we want to be
When we stop a beer is what we need
Brotherhood our passion is too ride
Adrenaline need the speed to stay alive
Me and my brothers travel with thunder
Iron horses we ride
Friday night the engines roar
44 riders ride until the dawn
Friday night the engines roar
44 riders ride until the dawn
Then the darkness comes
With cold autumn winds
Hibernation time for the bikes
Love and honor bros
Keep your heads up high
In the dark winter time
We got beer to stay alive
To stay alive
Ride to live live to ride
It's all we need to stay alive
Ride to live to stay alive
I choose the darkness
It's in my blood
I'm forged in the deepest depths of hell
And I am heartless
A broken spell
I rule the world and I do it well
Feel me creeping under your skin
As you beg you let me win
Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
Fly free
I am the strongest
I conquer all
I'll lift you up to see you fall
And you're addicted
Just one more time
I'm in your soul I'm in your mind
Feel me creeping under your skin
As you beg you let me win
Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
Fly free
Take a leap into freedom
There's nothing nothing
That will make you see
We're not stronger than the weakest link
Hold on hold on
To your precious greed
Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
Fly free
Fly with your broken wings
We are forever
We are eternity
We're strong together
Through pain and agony
You broke the promise
You said we would be free
We did the labor
We lived in misery
Blood on the windows
Tears in the lake
This innuendo
Forced us to break
Tired and wounded
Blood on our hands
We were forsaken
In foreign lands
We stood beaten in the rain
Now you won
We are forever
We are eternity
We're strong together
Through pain and agony
We felt so broken
You thought we couldn't see
And then you forced us
To do dirty deeds
The dark is upon us
Reality wins
Crushed under sorrow
Scars on our skins
The weight we were under
Crushing our fate
Lonely and broken
We turned the stakes
We stood beaten in the rain
Now you won
We are forever
We are eternity
We're strong together
Through pain and agony
Tainted water falls on the edge
Of sleep thoughts coalesce
Into perfect view serenity
So calm completely breeding
Impending realms of death
Crowned he is born into the night
Blind eyes burning silent accord
Bring forth the pain inherited then
Death valley awakens the dark overlord
Visions of a lover's warm embrace
Replaced with tears of rage
A friendship's steady bond wavering
Falling gone broken
Piercing thoughts consume my flesh
Grinding teeth will disintegrate
Reason losing with every step I take
Waking into hell's reality
Dying within this dream landscape escape
Eyes open towards a new day's doom
My soul an open vein
Darkness will bring him forth once more
Never to long for the sleep again
In my dreams I cry
Time weighing  pushing towards sanity's end
Towards the end towards to end Midnightmares out for you  me
Haunting my body comes creeping destroying all sense of tranquility
Slipping  falling  hiding  soon out of luck
Lock yourself away before dusk
Deceiving my body possessing my mind
Quickly now help me soon out of time
Soon I shall awaken
And reason with my own
Accepting this sentence in silence
Shame as my new home
Haunting my body comes creeping destroying all sense of tranquility
Slipping  falling  hiding  shit out of luck
Lock yourself away before dusk
This yearning grows ill when thoughts of you
Slip through me like poison
Birth of this sickness infecting my will
Relics upon my return
Exiling is futile
Remnants from a world forsaken
Home of the hopeless
Scars of this weakness
Memories fading forever
I long for death's promise to be set free
Roman's escape veneer
Beneath lies a true prison
Never to return to the sweetness of soft flesh
This Elba a deathbed
Thoughts of return fantasy
Broken dreams lay me softly down
Home of the fallen
Scars of battles lost
In sickness forevermore
Fall from a higher state becoming less through time
Moments of grand delusion forthcoming
A lapse into something divine perhaps it's all a disguise
Expendable contortions follow a race against what is real
A lapse from grace is the eternal triumph of evil
When insanity reign's king
So follow me now you're falling behind
Have the will to set free
Let the weakness quickly ease the pain
Tomorrow a shadow that never became
Drawn into this marathon of death
Falling deeper  deeper  further away
I cannot confront the pain
And risk what keeps me sane
Now I lay myself to sleep
I close my eyes  heart for keeps
Please let me go before I wake
My home my heart my joy my fate
Demons creeping into sight
Emotions running to the finish line
Racing beats turn to a screech
The end is near I feel it closing in
I never shall put up a fight
Resignation doomed for eternity death forever
A nightmare within a dream
I rise in this dream world of mine
Stacking corpses a mile high
In this dream world of mine
Valley of darkness a kingdom of mine
Madness consumes the beast inside
Acres of sickness nothing left untouched
Ripping through bodies devouring their guts
Not all shall parish I must control the urge
And build a strong foundation with your corpse
Valley of darkness a kingdom of mine
Madness consumes the beast inside
Acres of sickness nothing left untouched
Ripping through bodies devouring their guts
I rise in this dream world of mine
Stacking corpses a mile high
In this nightmare of mine
Here we go down that same old road again
Sympathy unfolds the shell that holds all the beauty within
Here we go down that same old road again
A memory a regret a hope
Here we go down that same old road again
Empathy controls the wind that blows and tickles our skin
A memory a regret a hope a stimulant
Recent it seems
We must push on we must push on
Though we bleed
We must push on we must push on
All you need is a modest house in a modest neighborhood
In a modest town where honest people dwell
Making the cleanest energy for the greenest plants to grow
Richest soil that is drenched with the freshest rain
Then you should sit in your backyard
Watch clouds peak over the tallest mountain tops
Cuz they unveil honest opinions about the stars
We must push on we must push on
Recent it seems
We must push on we must push on
Though we bleed
We must push on we must push on
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
All you need is a modest house
In a modest neighborhood
I can't even concentrate on this
It's overthought anticipated
The pen ink is running dry
It's been thrown to paper and wasted
Creativity has been blocked and overtasted
Maybe in time I'll appreciate it
Hold on hold on
We'll be with you soon
These papers are stuck in this book
Until they're torn out and pasted
To the inside of my memory
Where I can later look and see them in a new gallery
Where they can later be viewed and appreciated
Hold on hold on
We'll be with you soon
We'll be with you
Longing for what has been lost
Longing for what hasn't been obtained
It's a small cost
Forgot the past lost the future only now remains
Hold on hold on
We'll be with you soon
We'll be with you
We're born into silence and let it all be
Lift your anchor and just float astray
Born into silence and let it all be
Fortune in silence
Watch it explode
While fragments of ironies examples fly
And hit the shore
And tyranny's torn
From the podiums where leaders stand
But rule no more
Plead with nothing Why don't we lecture about something
Protest the way we're passive today
Watch it explode
While it's not impossible
For flowers to bloom and grow next to graves
And babies are born
In the same buildings where people go
To pass away
Pass away
Plead with nothing Why don't we lecture about something
Protest the way we're passive today
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
We live like penguins in the desert
Why can't we live like tribes
Born into silence and let it all be
Lift your anchor and just float astray
Born into silence and let it all be
Fortune in silence
Distorted and complicated
I'm sorry but its over
Essential to awaken
I'm leaving
Here we are
That's what it's all about
I'm sorry but its over
To love here and to love this
I'm finally breathing
Before you go
There is something more to say
Before you go
There is something more to say
Persistent resentment
I'm sorry but its over
Seduction for destruction
I'm finally breathing
Before you go
There is something more to say
Before you go
There is something more to say
Before you go
There is something more to say
This lonely old man had heart
Resting grey hairs on wrinkled arms
With nothing but a stool to hold up his back
Skinny legs with Japanese mileage
Crossed at the ankles
He's unaware
Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Unaware of his surroundings
Youth it passed
Swarming like wolfs to a fresh kill
The scented tracks
He's just scared about dying
Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave yourself if you want in
It's the only way to understand it
Too bad
Too bad
Too bad
So sad
Days have come to an end
Where all
Where all has been lost
Maybe you've never seen it
Maybe you've never been through it
It's the only way to understand it
Save your clever statements
Brave yourself if you want in
It's the only way to understand it
To understand it
The opera is over
Singers have all gone home
Seats are empty
The kitchen is closed
The sidewalks are sprayed down
The blinds are pulled down
The foundation's unstable
The wrecking ball is back
Quiet business vacancy
Quiet business vacancy
Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Symphony's concluded
The instruments are all cased up
The notes are silent
The music's still apparent
Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Spirits are jaded
Art is dying
Is art dead
Art is dying
Is it dead
Believe it
We need it to move on
A one track mind in a one way town
Let's go ahead and gentrify
We let art die with robot minds
Steal the brush and paint boundary lines
A stale kind the people we'll find
Walking in single file line
I think its time to finally rewind
Lets go ahead we might as well
Rents are rising
Our lease is up
Culture is down
Spirits are jaded
I think I'm awake
Rolling on my blanket
I am sinking into the bed
Light around me
Beautful washes of pulsating color
Buzzing white noise
It sounds like one hundred bees
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
Pulsing
You control it
Body's asleep
And your mind is awake
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
I too once thought the radio played
Let's act like children while we sleep paralyzed
White cloth black napkins
Wood chairs surround me
Wood tables foggy sign
In front with no light
Night falls beneath candle light
Cast shadows
Insence fragrance
From the corner of the room
Cloudy senses Stale light below
Beneath me
Night falls beneath candle light
White squalls beneath winter skies
Night falls beneath winter skies
White squalls beneath winter skies
Faceless crowd of elderly beings
Roses sprouting yellow glow
Subconcious into the light
Night falls beneath candle light
White squalls beneath winter skies
Think we know
Oblivious though
Unified clones
Sit like stones
Up on thrones
Of fool's gold
Looking bold
But all alone
Restore our needed shelter
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Pants at my knees
Fading with growth
Lie awake
Buried stones
All alone
Restore our needed shelter
Our flawless endeavors
To be alone
To be alone
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Passing my knees
Sitting sideways
Something deep
Wading water
Pants at my knees
Fading with growth
Lie awake
Lie awake
Lie awake
The only things surrounding you now
Are the circular memories
Infect your conscience
They are the make up of your worries
Regrets and doubts
Elective betrayal of your person
Radiates confidence
Shine with silence
And shadow the ones below
This drought is leaving me
With cracked soil and brown leaves
Floating on a dry lake bed
With a dry mouth and foggy head
Waiting for the snow
When the water comes
I will overflow
I will overflow
When the water comes
I will overflow
There's one more thing
I forgot to tell you
Worries and doubts
Will only help you
In the long run
You'll shadow the ones below
This drought is leaving me
With cracked soil and brown leaves
Floating on a dry lake bed
With a dry mouth and foggy head
Waiting for the snow
When the water comes
I will overflow
I will overflow
When the water comes
I will overflow
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
I built a wall
It stretched one thousand miles
Set it off
Massacre
It's holding up the roof
Breast feed your heart
Set it off
I saw a distant port
With no water to support
Burning the bridge between
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Never content nor satisfied
Tensions of self
The massacre changed history
Borderline paranoia
Yelling at their own rights
Set it off
Does anybody feel this way
Does anybody feel like I do
Though half of me is gone
The lonesome heart is there
I cannot find the other half
I cannot find the other half
I cannot find the other half
I cannot find the other halfVictims are crying as their country dies
Bombs away
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Bombs away
Torture labs death camps
Massdeath n destruction
Who Who gave you the right
Killing is your business a theater of fear
Scarnwars up your arse
Killing is your business the headsman is here
Scarnwars up your arse Up your arse
Yesterdays march tomorrows war
Anger anger Legacy of anger
Pale n blond afraid of the dark
Anger anger Legacy of anger
Driven by pure hate or true fear
Anger anger Legacy of anger
Fucked up passes out that´s my game
Drive fast die hard total insane
Alco Alcoholocaust
Heads down throw up coma for hours
Swallow puke shitface no control or power
Alco Alcoholocaust
They kick you in your face
Make your body bleed
Brutalize
They rape your sisters
To satisfy their needs
Brutalize
Aggression´s growing a feeling we can´t live without
This fight I gotta win Thorazin
People tell me what to do how to live
This fight I gotta win Thorazin
I´m in no need of others brains
I´m not bound to any chains
This fight I gotta win Thorazin
The sound of death fills the air Acts of violence
Amounts of blood on the ground Acts of violence
Shot down cut down people fighting all around
Hittin´ Punchin´ Stabbin´ Shooting
Bloodshed guns  knives people fighting for their lives
Hittin´ Punchin´ Stabbin´ Shooting Reality
The future is a miserable extension of the past
Future Futureless
If we go outside we make the sun turn black
Future Futureless
No use for communication it´s a go nowhere situation
Gotta gun on my left truncheon on my right
Killer with a badge
Pigsblood in my veins no hope insight
Killer with a badge
A fuckface in black a real SOB
I´m your local police kill me
Kill destroy destroy kill
Fight back fight back
You don´t have to be black to fight back
Death from above cities in flames
Eternal warfare
Lightning strikes through burning skies
Eternal warfare
We´re Aholes for hire we give you fire
Eternal warfare
Brainstorm dead cells hells bells
Smash the silence gimme distortion to hellI cannot get the news on screen
A headfuck day in day out
Dumb shit of a hypocrite in pain
Been reelected not respected
War is not an action game
Rise with me  against the control
Proud we'll be  the other side
Raise your fist  against the control
Support all you anarchists
Rock their butts to pieces
I ain't fucked up do resist
Take your stand  against the control
Hand by hand  the other side
Take a ride  against the control
Hit them from the inner side
Rock their butts to pieces
I ain't fucked up do resist
Cry when you feel the same
Step by step in your own trap
On a one way track  it goes on and on again
And they're sending it again and again
A disgusting spot with the flames
That burn as Bush fires hot
Hit the Christian hit the nation
People in intimidation
Feel the sweat in the hand
See the back of a man
Go ahead to the front to the bowl of blood
And then the lights are going down
And they're starting the sound
Come on we'll fire it up to the ecstasy
About 40 degrees stifled cough and breathe
Getting kicked to the front to the left and back
And when you're hitting the ground
You've got no second to count
Until they're pulling you up to go on and on
I have not forgotten
That to selfdestruct is the power that gives me this type of
Strength
On the ground of the pain
We've got no damned and no saint
We're all just the same dark silhouettes
Who're all singing the verse instead of call out a curse
And we're coupling high to our maximum
55 degrees
Bell rings in my head  welcome to the pit
I have not forgotten
How to selfdestruct for rockin'
I have not forgotten
That to selfdestruct is the power that gives me this type of
Strength
Aiming not to collapse
Blocking up all the checks
Celebrate in the wave that we build at once
It is a thing to believe in voluntary receiving
Come on we're rolling it on watch the circle go
66 degrees
Sweat is running down my face
It burns in my eyes again
Because I have not forgotten
Blast it up
The way you walk the way you talk
You silly piece of blown up pork
It makes me puke right away
Two more words you make my day
The stampmark pressed into your face
Kick me hard the message says
You broke the rules without a shame
But listen trouble is my name
So eye of the devil  eye
Rise to hell level  rise
I'm gonna push your turnoff switch
Cause you're going too far
I rock you down and hit you hard
I like your smile while spitting blood
You fool you're goin' another way
For every pain you gain on me
You've got an expensive price to pay
You've got the cash and will to stay
To sacrifice in agony
You're walking down the delight road
To melt and fit that pleasure chord you said
You preached a lot of what you were
Respecting friends and taking care of them
Time's too short to bury your
Good gifts and strength  keep you alive at all
A bit in you a bit in me
Together to eternity we said
I won't fade
A look up there a look inside
A stone to touch a tear to hide the pain
Buddies talk about destiny
Excusing faults that cannot be repeated
The train has left the shot is done
The time is lost the game of life goes on
Your curtain falls we're calling on
Still hoping but no encore comes at all
I feel clean inside
Man I lost you
That gap hurts deep inside
Man I'm calling for you again
For sure you're in for better times
So take your seat where you belong and then
Keep some place in your own line
Remember us we'll follow in the end
Do you still taste do you still feel
The cold the heat the love and hate around
Just send little signs to me
If things are still as they have been before
They come with tanks and spread disdain
Pumping down a culture's fate
If young if grand if armed or not
For freedom in the name of God
And then you freak out and you're seeking
For a victim of your mission
Feel the pressure that is steaming
Be the killer of the regime
I hate this fate
My hate is my way
Hunt for you  hunt for me  hunt for everybody
Could be you  could be me  could be anybody
Hating you  hating me  hating everybody
Feel no sorry no worry for anybody
Can't you forget
Blood for oil and tears for all
Thrills and kills of defend call
Go alone to sacrifice
Now run for revenge try to die
Can't you see
Can't you feel
Hating you  hating me  hating everybody
Killing you  killing me  killing every fucking body
Can't you see there's no way out of hell
You spread your hands above me
You treat me like a fool
I can't say that everything that I do
Makes me one of those freaks you want me to
I can't stand that pain  dark god is inside me
This is the laughter you deserve
I set the law you break
Then I can't hold out what you fake
Cause I hit so proud
I hit so loud
I'm hoping  face confrontation
I cannot face the lie
Cannot leave you alive
I'm hoping  face confrontation
I cannot stay
Without a kill
I can't stand that pain  dark god is inside me
I've got high octane  dark god is inside me
I can't forget all the patience that you sent to me in the past
I can't forget all the sorrow that you sent to me at last
Now you can't forget all patience that I sent to you in the past
You can't forget all the sorrow that I send to you at lastI'm a regent of the off beam
The curser of sagacity
And products of my deeds
Show the flipside of my needs
I track a slip through
Flashing reminiscences
Within my dimming mindset
Ad Hoc Revolt
Rage Erratic
Ad Hoc Revolt
Rage Erection
Descend
Let my preferences be with you
Rather than with what infects me
What destroy everything in mankind
Pierce me with your incessant love
Let me once again see the waste
In my sporadic choices
Let me again feel the rapture
In serving you my Father
My rapture
Your grandeur
Filth is my spawn
Destroying the connection
With you whom I crave
Ad Hoc Revolt
Rage Erratic
Ad Hoc Revolt
Rage Erection
Ascend
In your glory
I'm ecstatic
THE DEATH CONCEPT
Smack your own pride / Treat it with disgust
When looking in the eyes / Of our borrowed time
Strip down to the basics
Of your own soul / And think
LIFE IN ESSENCE
Sense a limit / To what's accepted
Char the barriers / To certainty
Search beneath ideas
Indoctrinated as logic in common
There will be answers / And you'll find
Turn your egos the fist
And the enemy your other cheek
Cease entertaining
Them
Cause that's what they want
Cause they're not unique
In their false individualism
But you're canvas / And so are they
Triumph Standardization
No one is a redeemer / But the one who is
Pity attempts for / Selfsalvation
As we're intended / Acronyms for Messiah
In pattern in union
A prime loom / Of life in essence
WE ALL SCHLEP
This is just a glimpse before our eyes
Watch how the ants are working
Come Armageddon
Trumpet ricochets are still audible
I The bitter sound of a concluding sunset
II The raging triumph of a glorious birth
The unison parade
A display for the globe
An exhibition for the mob
I Conquered and asphysiated
In bedlam and madness
As witnessing their corpses
II Liberation upon them
With their written names
They watch from the skies
I Now being flayed by the thought of perdition
II Now being saved by the tongue confessing
I The bitter sound of a concluding sunset
Opinions construe the occurrence
Interpreting the prophetic act
Into science
II The raging triumph of a glorious birth
A consciously chosen selfschism confirmed
To an enduring point of soul
The unison parade
A display for the globe
An exhibit for the mob
Neimand Ghet Vorbei
Pervading our whole
Translating reality
Through which the essence
Of life is realized
Giving sense to this
Intermediate stage
Inextricably connected
To the next
Stardom in darkness
A glory on our heads
Clearing the view
In this crescendo
Leading us to
The inner sanctum
A new meaning of sanity
Where we can understand
His philanthropy
And why this should be ours
Where love is real
And not an element
Of a sine qua non
Where heaven and 
The divine idiom is ours
And we're not smothered
By anything
Stardom in darkness
A glory on our heads
Salmesang
Ved høylys dag
Hatet
I hvert hjerteslag
Hellighet
I sjelens speil
Ondskapen
I åndens seil
Glansen
Lyser lett I skinnet
Dødsdisippel
Preger sinnet
Rullett
Rullett
Kledet
Former lett en kropp
En kiste rommer
Evighet
Hevder hver sjel
Dagen kommer
Da strupen
Smaker sannhet
Og øyet lukkes
Rullett
Rullett
Razor sharp realities
Cutting edge thrash
The harsh process of
Converging a mind's omega
A shot of sense now and then
Doesn't ease nor release
All riven inside / And I'm my own
Destruction's czar
Unify me us
In unison internally
Craving for your riveting appearance
In the mess of gods
My eyes are dazzled
From every hold
All riven inside
Deah knell / An event in progress
The sound of triumph
Is over the hills
But I refuse to 
Lower my flag
Even though I may
Pulled the trigger myself
Angels will sing me a hymn
Debunk the tongue
Within my head
Remove the cancer 
On my optic nerve
And I'm my own
Razing soul authorities
Cutting edge mind rape
A killing narcosis society
Where we can't spot
The nebula
Even when staring
At the open sky
If God or Devil come here it's better they come armed
Prayers and worships are foolish
To Kill and demolish are the only power in this world
Here is worst than hell
Kill the king
And be your own king
Cold is the blood to make justice with your own hands and to show for all who is the king Who is the king
Terror and tragedy hunger and misery these are the fortune of the king
A king that's reigning silent in a Kingdom of blood
Pay the price of being born in this shit
If you're not a king anything remains for you
The dreams and wishes are for few
If you're not a king this world is not for you
I am the king
Devastation
The bombs don't choose their victims The rain of fire destroys all on the ground
Desolation Parts of bodies spread in piles 
The cruelty is the supply to this terror
To exist is to destroy
To survive is to construct
This is the most destructive art
Cowardice Misery
They'll kill you without mercy
They want their way free
Free to construct an empire over the corpses of their enemies
Innocents cry beneath the ruins mutilation and death are all that I see
As tractor crushing all in their way we are killing destroying and triturating anyway
I'm one of them and who will try to face me
Join me Join us
The men who break bones
I am the bone grinder
I am the worst assassin
I'll arrest your soul burn your flesh and triturate your bones all your bones
Who will dare to cross your way
I will break your spine and triturate anyway
I'm one of them and who will try to face me
The men who break bones
Don't try to face me
Don't try to stop me
I'm stronger than ever
Don't try to betray me
My ion hands will reduce your skull to bran
As a brutal fierce fucking machine
Excepting me who else can make God or Satan fear of
War is my name and I become disgusted for little things
If you pass my way you can be sure you will last with your mouth full of ants
My bullets don't demand a minimum age to finish someone
All gods will know who is their only master
My felling for pain is intense and I have many forms to show you how much perverse we are too
Excepting me who else can decide who will live or die on this land
I am the worst form of life that treads in this world
If there is a God and his color is white
I'm the deepest black in its lowest form
I won't tolerate their wails hear their prayers
That makes me smile
They say to you love the next one
If they attack you offer you other face to them
Torture and torment
Your life is a nightmare
Assassins are out there and you became a prisoner
Now it's time to follow the spiritual force to kill
Now it's the chance to forget the sarcastic words of God
If they attack you offer your vengeance
Goodness is for the weakest minds on earth
Die with your goodness
If someone shall win it must be you Blood is a fortune you must keep yours into your own veins
Without the war the peace would never exist
Malevolence Demonic
You can't control the evil
Sacrifices Suicides
You can only burn it if they attack you kill Who saves the wolf blames the sheep
Who will blame you
Sharp words to knife the reason and the truth
A serpent squirts hate
The jealousy burns their eyes
The poison of their words is to dilute in your blood
Don't put the words in the mouth of another
They are calling
I can hear their screams and their lies
They want you into the pit
Alone
Your children will learn to obey and will replace your in this life of slavery
Interrogations and equations they will never teach the formulas
Shut up and hear this lesson learn to obey
Your time is now
Open your eyes
Don't lose the chance of changing your life
You Scream will break the silence and make everyone think the ray of light
Your children Interrogations
Your time is now changes your life
Your scream is the ray of light
Frustrations and deceptions don't lose the chance of changing your life
Ignorance and conformation your scream will break the silence
No reaction and no reflections learn to obey and lose your hope  Now
In the dark of night fall the masks of morality denied sensations in the light of day
It's the testimony of a suffered nocturnal humanity
Where the angels fall in the abyss of the hell
Waiting for the sunset awaiting to be free now the blood and flesh feed the soul
It's the testimony of a suffered nocturnal humanity
Where the angels fall in the abyss of the hell
Where would you end in heaven or in hell in dark of the night or in lies of day
In dark of the night fall the masks of morality denies sensations in the light of day
Everyone's betrayed greed forced to choose between surrender and death
We can choose between to be good or bad
Everyone's imposed to live the same truth but it doesn't make dreams come true
These are the differences what humanity didn't learn to respect
We are the species of slavery
Wisdom without direction
The words become the weapon to hurt deep the ego and self esteem
Someone doesn't even want to sleep 'cause the dreams will turn to nightmare
You can lose your force to fight 'cause the sadness will rot your soul
Damned be all who sell their souls to the enemies
Keep with you the innocence
It's a fragment of the infinity
It's the difference between the true wisdom and the superficial knowledge of desert heart
It's leading people to wander through the empty space without direction
Now I can see the time going back slowly
Unprogressive
Plagues and medieval terror are evidences in my sight
Prophets of philosophers
It's evolution that everybody has searched for
It's led us to a could and colorless past
Hear the dead You have just two days before becoming like everyone
Where is the God to cure and save the sick
I can hear the people praying for the one who's left carrying a cross to escape from the hell
A hurricane destroys cities in its way Oceans overflow and islands drown
Someone runs to the churches to pray his last prayers Someone saves his soul
Someone saves his fortune The end is near
Souls are burning in black fire
The fire of the endless pain
And now I can fell the time going back slowly
It's led us to a cold and colorless past
The men what adventure on his lands and don't be afraid of the dragons and curses
They leave mark in the history of the world and they make a way of light in the dark of the night
Weak aside
We are the best
Come and taste the victory
Kill your enemies C'mon and taste the victory now
Days of fight and nights of death
Do you want to escape
The ones who became passive they were sucked to the oblivion
The real victory has no price
March with honor
We go to the battlefield we fight for the worth that men have lost for dignity many times forgotten and for domain of your lands
Be my guest in hell
On these lands there's no place for the powerless
I'll domain destroying all that remains
I've seen your show before
I know how it will end
You're selling your very own truth
For all the weak who wanna believe
in your way to be saved
You will get your prize or make them burn in hell
When the fools are under your spell
How do you explain it to your own soultobesaved
when life is running out and there's no sign of light
All the nonsense has been made just to rule
Made to be followed by all you fools
They think for you
And tell you what to do
To keep your mind away from how the things really are
For all the weak who wanna
believe in you
For all the weak you wanna
you wanna rule
How deep the lie will go
Will you die before you know
All that I feel
in your oblivious soul
Seems to me that
you have lost control
Everything is lost
there's nothing left to gain
Seems to me that
I have lost the game
Why can't you feel
my fragile mind
Seems that your heart
is turning blind
Everything you've lost
in my very soul
feels to me
you are out of control
Too many times you have drowned me
into makebelieve which gave the light to dark
Where I was crawling on my way to get out
Still I'm putting my hope on you
Diving into the void
I'm trying to grab your mind
make you follow me down
to where I lie
to where it's decided
If we live or die
and is there any light in the void
All that we lost
on our wasted ground
If only I could
make it all turn around
have you ever had the convenience
to know how good it feels to be wrong
Here's no use in sheding the tears
'Cause there's no one to hear them drop
There's no use in telling the fears
'Cause there's no one to cease the pain
Not just to make it through today
If only I could live it that's my dream
There's no use in laying the faith
'Cause there's no one to understand
There's no use in sheding the tears
'Cause there's no one to dry them away
Through my days I have been
much too many times
The victim of the crimes
Made by their eyes
too weak to tell the truth
it stayed covered up with lies
so strong that they made me believe
Now I am facing here this fight
I never wanted
I think that I am just a bite
For you to have
Now I am far too weak to protect
Myself from you
Come and strike me down and I won't
Even raise a hand
When everything is taken away from you
it doesn't matter how you're gonna lose
you're going down
I know the winner will be
the last man standing
And when the battle will begin
I'm caught up by surprise
How could I win
In the end it's all the same how I choose
To fight you down
In the end it's all the same how I'll lose
I'm gonna drown
When everything is taken away from you
it doesn't matter how you're gonna lose
you're going down
I know the winner will be
the last man standing
And when the battle will begin
I'm caught up by surprise
How can I win
And in the end it is so easy
to laugh about the scars
laugh about the scars
When you don't have a clue
of what they may have done to you
The bloody wounds of misery
you laugh at them in agony
In agony
Sometimes I'm hoping for these nightmares to take me away
To end the pain
But then reflections of how it used to be
come to my mind like whispering debris
I have to end the pain
I'm begging for a chance to fight again
With fire in their hearts
yearning to live their lives
all they ever wanted
was to bear their own cross
but What is left after the fight
Faith and pride lost in time
War will always be the same
Lost dreams in lost horizon
Too much pain to keep up the fight
No faith to believe there's time
War will always be the same
Lost children with lost tomorrow
So little thet ever asked for
So much was taken away
They weren't the ones to choose
Lost faith
Too many children  Have lost their faith
Too many children  Have seen their brothers die
Too many children  Have lost their own
Too many children  Have learnt how to hate
None of your games
I've ever played
All of your deeds
ever betrayed
None of your thoughts
I've ever bought
You're sellin' lies
day after day
All of your games
full of those lies
you've never had
a doubt of yourself
Enough you have bought
the stories you've sold
to believe in that shit
day after day
Now I am right here
in front of your madness
hearing all the
promises of gold
But you should know
I don't care
because you will lose in the end
When you crusify how do you justify
You did make it all so clear
but I don't wanna see
and you think
you have saved your own life
The gambling must be
your way to win
my way to the top
ain't in your sight
Lost all you had
still think you'll win
crying for gold
day after day
Treasure was there
right in your hands
but you let it go
you let it flow
Thinking I might
Saying I will
you can go on
day after day
Something what once was desired
turned into a thrill
that should not
ever be
Now I'm kneeling down to ground
I'm begging for the reasons
I'm asking for comprehension
I am crying out for explanation
for all I've done
There's no answer
but my own weakness
And I'm crying now
The tears of this betrayal
reversed to cause
So much deeper pain
than the others
could ever make me feel
I thought I could
fight back the lust
but I'm too weak
the desire burns
It's much too strong
I've betrayed your trust
How could you ever forgive me
When I can't
All that's happened now to me
Just confusing torturing
How did I end up
like this
As I'm dying now
I hope I've paid for my deeds
I tried to fight to make things right
but for me the price was
these wounds in my soul
they won's heal
One's life taken away and lost
And other's dream is crushed to dust
All the things are like thin ice
they're breaking down before my eyes
Today it seems too hard to have some faith in you
Tomorrow when I look at you
I can't help thinking how you do
All these things you don't exist
a prisoner in timeless mist
I never will escape from your lust
How could I find the faith tomorrow
Today and tomorrow
there will be sorrow
Today and tomorrow
It's all in vain
And deep inside there is just sorrow
Today and tomorrow
there will be sorrow
Today and tomorrow
Nothing to gain
I wonder why I am in fear
Life just ain't fair
But who of us is to decide
Everything is crashing down
It seems I can not carry on
Where is the beauty
Where did it go
Hanging on by a thread
And all these fragile dreams
we don't know when they'll fall
It' like a book of misery
Time turns the pages on and on on and on
Sitting in my cold chair waiting for the dark
Feelings overwhelm me giving me a spark
I see you standing there with fear in your eyes
Begging me for forgiveness no big surprise
Voices calling in my head
keep telling me these things
Thoughts racing through my head
in this game no one wins
See you by the window planning your escape
Should I just tie you up just to play it safe
I'm gonna make you pay
For every tear I shed
Until death do us part
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you 'til you're dead
I need help to get me out of this damn maze
I need help
I'm afraid of what's alive in me will kill
Oooo I'm afraid
I need help to get out of this damn maze
Oooo I need help
I'm afraid of what's alive in me will kill
Ooooo what's alive in me will kill
Keep my eyes on you just to make it sure
In this lonely world I feel so insecure
Guilt and anger don't give me moment's rest
Should I end it now wouldn't that be best
Never was a problem to you
to slam the door
before my very eyes
Never bothered you
to know I'm fading
this way I'm dying
You are the shorn in my flesh
the poison in my blood
tortuse in my soul
I am just asking you
I'm begging you to tell me
what I am to you
If only you could see
inside me
there alone
with my painW
Did it ever cross your mind
that it could hurt  the way you say so sweet
Did you ever think that I could get hurt
 the way you treat me so sweetI Am Lost Far From The Cross You Stand Before

Get down
Bitch Whore Cunt Slut BitchUnweaving strands of failure
Propagating the obscene
Intentions gone asunder
Tearing down the human facade
I will give life Relentless pursuit of action
I will decide The traits that blind humanity
Regenerate Reliving the generations
A boundless chain Correcting their mistakes
Solutions we seek to our mortality
Tampering in greed inflated arrogance
Nature's course diverted by men who interfere
Rampant emptiness reject this world
Blindly seizing solace in easily spun lies
Mutations in the genome chain improve our quality of life
Blindly seizing refuge in ten billion dollar lies
We're consumed by both sides then shit out to die
Living this undying prophecy resurrect what should remain dead
Fleshing out this unspoken travesty all of us fight this unholy war
Sinking into a mockery of truth we become miskeepers of mankind
Unrestrained avarice we would become God
Magnified selfpreservation living disease
Inured soulless dull vanity
A system of subjugation order constrained
Hordes of drones just for more
buying into everything the pulpit of lies
The path to truth is frozen politicized
Stuffing the world full of vagrant inbred drones
To control who they are
Instinct we breed compulsively
Regeneration epidemic simulate reality
Suspend a mass monopolized
Triumphs of technology the maladjusted ciphers
Perverse corrupt power scheme
Meddling incompetence creating minds that misfire
Who will survive
Provocation undeclared like cowards they advance attacking the unarmed
Campaign of dishonor calculated violence inflicted on civilians
Narrowminded wrath selfrighteous anger acting out intolerance
Damning themselves accursed adversaries of Godgiven liberty
Terror innocent life destroyed by
Cowards committing crimes injustice
Empty nothing to hope for but death
Brainwashed programmed from birth to hate
Idiot protests from luxury of safety ignorant of facts
Preaching dull inaction as burning towers fall shattering the peace
Stab us in the back awaken our revenge our appetite to kill
United in grief we accept your invitation to erase you all
They want to kill the free the liberated infidels
They claim no fear of death they'll see it soon enough
Suitable response build a proper case collect the evidence discover what
they tried to hide
Necessary force accurate assault our justified revenge we'll live to see
them die
One Shot One Kill
Extremist factions bear arms without honor attacking our public
One Shot One Kill
Covert involvement outlaw callow leaders ignoble denial
One Shot One Kill
Our captured soldiers tortured to death defiled human corpses
Hundreds confirmed not one ever saw me
Punishment requited in blood
Enemies threats eliminate them
Reciprocity I deliver
No escape I'll find them
Their vain cause they'll die for their crimes
Ponder judgment of this
Walking corpse with seconds left to live
With this weapon I damn the malignant
Forward the bolt slides into place
Highspeed alloy pierce the hearts of evil
Fucking rats to rot in obstruction
Approach by stealth in silence I strike penetrate all their defenses
Enemy lines dissected besieged annihilation to meet my objective
Sanctioned psyops imminent targets predatory infiltration
Lethal resolve warfare command precision of fire I'll terminate your life
Disgraceful the evil done by false prophets in God's name
Profit from intimidating poor lost souls into the flock
Selling a grand facade pompous posturing in vain
Reinforce spiritual weakness insecurity
Forgotten essential freedom of choice
All goodness is discarded kindness affected
Right or wrong coerce the congregation mob
To abide your tumid words the only god they know
Selective agenda with no foundation in truth
Corruption stumbling block ruined credibility
Vulgar salesmen growing fat lies  you tell consume your sheep
Crucify the innocent absolve yourself with dollar bills
Selfrighteous presuming cast stones of hypocrisy
Impose your nauseating senseless fantasy
Built on payment not contrition speciously redeemed
Iniquity punishment on anyone who disobeys
Forgotten essential the freedom of choice
All goodness is discarded kindness affected
Selling out redemption you will never grasp
Disgrace all men of faith
Selfrighteous presuming cast stones of hypocrisy
Impose your nauseating senseless fantasy
Built on payment not contrition speciously redeemed
Iniquity punishment on anyone who disobeys
Unwillingness to accept reality
Myopic grip on the words of men
Blind loyalty without faith service to an institution
Betraying trust and our liberty
Sin of greater depth than those you would save
Blaming tragedy on our intolerance
You spent your life as a sordid pharisee
Unjust don't be shocked when you're barred from Paradise
Valor they instill to face certain death in conflict
Win the war through discipline trained to follow orders
Dilettantes of war torn apart
Send them all to be slaughtered standard training set
In a dark distant foreign shithole wretched torment
Approaching the vile sphere of contention breathing the smoke the dust
Bloodsoaked earth stained red oceans four your insides
Sudden hail gunfire half the men drop dead
Troops lost in transport waste of lives
Terrified grunts die confused
Send them all to be slaughtered
Insufficient base munitions
Compelled by force to fight until death
Certain causualty amateurs who all die before they learn to fight
Ruthless commanders order them to rush upon their imminent abrupt ends
Strategy of attrition mobbing them flailing corpses use up ammunition
Bravery cut in half by enemy artillery or cowardice punished by friendly
fire
Charge ahead expending divisions
Impotence gaining no ground
Bodies thrown conduct in war useless
Primitive only two ways home
Terrified grunts die confused
Reluctant and afraid to attack
How will anyone survive this
Only hope victory or death
Certain causualty amateurs who all die before they learn to fight
Ruthless commanders order them to rush upon their imminent abrupt ends
Dying in a dump ordinance erode tactics know what you must do to survive
Hiding in the dead lying still bare cover strike in stealth and then
disappear
Forge ahead retiring their forces
Spilling their confounded blood
Undermine their efforts to defeat us
Running gun only two ways home
Dig in and fire until the way is clear
Plummet of ruins slums further defaced
Snipers take heads harass your progress
Take them out pierce their eyes through their scopes
Die for honor motherland strewn about piles of corpses
Losing every last brave man better than surrender
Inescapable nightmare resolve unflinching
Never bow to tyranny
Make them pay for every step they take
Societal advancement an agenda of control
Forcing the elimination of hereditary flaws
Licensed breeding protocol man's course decided
Incarcerating violaters
Their spawn aborted state required forfeit
Human perfection far beyond our grasp
Cut out random flaws leaving glitches behind them
Talents that lay dormant left withered in the womb
Predetermined course they take no chances
Sleep submit obey accept it
Nature rejected culture forgotten
Dwell in their complacency
Drop your defenses swallow their bullshit
Close down all your doubtful dreams
They will not happen you don't have it in you
Their emotions stripped away
The depth of man measured proudly dismissed
Traits that bear malignant traces recognized without a cure
Magnify the scorn upon the disadvantaged
Living off the toil of others the rich inflate themselves
Treading on their laborers burdened by destitution
Born to be slaves from birth the rich own them
Rigid system caste of reproduction
Sequence profile science of misplaced trust
Tyrants protect their own
Propagate subordination
Despondence contrived alignment
Oppression induce class hatred
Insurgents revolt against them
Disregard their vacant morals
Interrupt their hoarded power
They will fall the balance will shift
Overturn their world of shit
Compelled to eternal hate censure of the mob submit to them
Pressured from the outside prevailing herd mentality fearing deviation
Traumatized retreat and submit habitual failure they no longer attempt
Resist all efforts at change practice the routine
Fake courage to impress the other sheep
All cowards in their own pointless twisted fate
Constant friction voicings of new converts don't know shit
Arbitrary changes visit ownership upon me
Do I look like I need you to rearrange my realm
Drift through the motions of your predetermined course
Escape the dreary confines of your present circle
Solve your internal conflict mend your own life
Follow useless trends fucking with my mind indignant lies that I reject
I care less and less for your weak opinion pretension pomposity
Reinforce your fear admonishment of fools path of least resistance
Bottomless mass of simpletons
Uncover your own future ignore the losers words
Endure the pessimism projections of the timid
Escape the dreary confines of your present circle
Solve your infernal conflict before your demise
Reinforce your fear admonishment of fools path of least resistance
I care less and less for your weak opinion pretension pomposity
You're not qualified to deliver me realize drop your crusade
Nothing will prevent the ends I have chosen
Agonizing reapprisal long ago I came unto my own
Discard the worthless bullshit comprehend the revelations beyond
Hypocrites eating shit choking on the spewings they never lived by
Estimations of lesser men selffulfilled to their dead ends
Scores upon scores what vengeance is right
Where did all this shit originate
Spiral of endless unlawful death
Wildfire of hatred barbaric vice
Fighting for their own opression absolute allegiance unrestrained killing
without cause
Wanton psychopathic action rabid empty conscience indelible never
satisfied
Paranoia offensive escalation pointless bloodshed hopelessly consumed
Mobs of irate radicals fanatical devotion
Brute force worn out know nothing else their life is hell death gives
them purpose
Vacant sense of their own worth unsanctioned war destruction
Misdirected anger reactionary homicide
Retaliation adolescent grasp of culpability bringing others misery
Taking out their fury on someone else
Coldblooded prejudice slaughtering innocents
Death is all that matters trade their life for mass murder
Poised to inflict mass suffering and pain
Genocide prophesied condoned by the word
Misperceiving truth inducements to explosive violence decimation is their
sole intention
Suicidal terrorists keep squandering their lives meaningless sacrifice
Another generation to serve a vengeful incarnation dying for a useless
cause
Constant aggressors born antagonists permanent ignorance
Decades behind they steal technology immoral misuse
Paranoia escalation pointless bloodshed no horror spared
Cheap vain murder know nothing else brute force worn out a world of shit
Shortsighted spiritual poverty desperate search to fill a hollow void
Lying in wait for a weakness exploiting any vulnerability
Children who'll die while they're young  stupid more wasted life
Monstrous desensitized dictator orders them to die
Violent assault presuming salvation awaits beyond
No hope for their future they war unto their end
Dysfunction poisoned ignorance reigns
The cycle protects it's own momentum impedes it's change
Corrupted young minds die old minds alike succumb
Totalitarian seduction it's a fucking lie
Psychosomatic infestation multisensoric infatuation
Mass media sublimination tearing our defenses down
Feeding us shit as we beg for more American way trend fucking whores
One's not enough we need ten more consume digest destroy discard
Tearing in the afterbirth of a bastard child a hated son
Looking on in disbelief as our resources burn
This is our legacy a crime against humanity
To feed our lives everything must die
From the moment we are born until our days are dying
We're violated crucified and burned upon the corporate cross
A disposable economy built on waste and tragedy
We eat the fast food of indifference and suffocate as one
Coerced by our campaign it demands our surrender
We're dying slowly for the pleasure of this machine
Assembly lines automate steal jobs from us all
They just don't give a fuck no one gives a fuck
Just cower as these bastards gag on their riches
Living off the prayers and hopes of our families
It's all gone
In our qquest for convenience sanity has died
Burying independant commerce under corporate shit
Multimillion ad campaign fulfills subconcious needs
Procreate our misery feed the enemy
Bleed fucking burn burn this American dream
Pummel our independence drive it to it's knees
No one to blame but ourselves as our capitalist dream collapses
And economic vengeance unleashedYou work so fucking hard to achieve your ideal in the time that you've allowed
but no the guarantee didn't hold up swallow hard bite back the fear
It's always been this way you just deceive yourself into thinking everything is fine
Cut your wrists watch them bleed a drop for every promise you can't keep
You're a loser not a winner you were born to lose
Them that has gets and you've got nothing you're a loser not a winner
It's always been this way nothing ever changes
Nations untrustworthy room filled with gasoline
2 men striking matches so they can see
They raise their guns and dare each other play a game of death
We call it Russian Roulette
One chance is all you get
Chambers loaded you got the hammer cocked
Barrels at your head a prayer's what you've got
Détente is undermined by the savages who lead us blind towards Armageddon or worse
Russian Roulette
Born into a class structure rich man or slave at his feet
Bystander or maker of crime killing in war or doing time
The elders who possess the power build areals in defense
You pay the price for their fears their memories they won't forget
It's your fate you don't decide
It's your fate struggle just to survive
The verdict in long before the first breath filled your lungs
Tomorrow you'll rise look around you wonder why
All you see in decay fate has not been kind
Holy war
Suicidal bomber dying for a cause and the life you're losing it's well worth the price
You're on a mission for your god and the innocents you take with you are examples of us all
Holy war holy war you keep killing you don't know who it's for
I watch you soldier as you stab her and laugh her mother draws her near
She takes her last breath
Then you unfold your leader's picture show him what you've done
Then you kiss his photo praise his holy one
Holy war holy war you keep killing you don't know what it's for
The giant fears that creep upon you as you gaze with open eyes
At the world that surrounds you hollow shells of faded dreams
Somewhere close I feel your breath and somewhere I sense death
What I felt for you last night is dying with the morning light
Shattered illusions makes me confused
Start making every scene searching every bar
You're working on another scheme illusion takes you but how far
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS WAY
Deceived by false hopes into thinking there was something more
I've left what matters slips away
Like grains of sand falling through my hands
All tomorrows are yesterdays
No one really cares
They're just out to survive and if you find it hard to believe you're the one who's living a lie
My life is pain all was taken that I gave
Left were only broken promises
All tomorrows are yesterdays
Can't you see you're wasting time
Believing in a better day that never comes and all the prayers that you pray won't change tomorrows from yesterdays
Death to our false love we live only to be gratified
Raise the sword high strike us down
You don't know me I owe you not a thing
Yet you believe it's your right to take it all
Wanting a slave you can devour I should fulfill your need 
Not on your life
Abuse me exploit me thick and red the blood I bleed
Dominate defile me drink it down the blood I bleed
Drill in my mind little girls are tolerated often used despised and hated
Gonna rot alone in their middle ages kept in line must control their rages
I see you've moved to another key holder
One's gonna treat you much better
He gives you strong advice about your life girl
Now that lover you trust and believe in has got you on a corner charging a fee yeah it's just the blood you bleed
I rip the flesh from your bones
I laugh as I watch it fall away
The blood from your veins falls like a shower
This passion you want to control
I the judge and the jury
I deliver the sentence
You who've not seen the light of day shall die before you awaken
There is no force in my life that I cannot control
I have your seed I spit it on the ground
I will not reap what you've sown
On the widows walk he waits for thee
On the widows walk I call your name
I'll give to you what you gave to me a term of confusion and pain
I stand alone await your return
I have nothing to gain
You can change fates decree on the widows walk I wait for thee
Can't you see we don't care about you
Can't you see we don't want your kind
We give you weapons to kill each other can't you see or are you blind
Vultures in the sky flying overhead
Vultures in the sky looking for the dead
You're doing just what we want you to do killing off your population
We've got you by your stupid pride
Rewarding it with frustrationThe lurker in the green sea
shades of a moving object
riches the temple that approaches
haunts my wishes of this insanity
gorgeous console I place there my claws
those who once ripped out my eyes
I need no longer human senses
Feel it how this can torture
the wagon with imaginations
scary glimpses with dreadful outlines
things I wish not to see
slaughtering my dearest throne
We will not be affected by this
for the blood of time has fornicated
Our minds our shell
my only shelter
the dreamt with delight
I see my options
and I choose the tunnel
see what my winged crayons
have painted
Let me shed a tear
and give birth to my sea
The only life is death
Speak of the armer
forgotten by reality
speak of the pearls
in crossing unnatural fragments
Perplex in a mortal disguise suddenly awared
Forbidden alowements in my mindwar
functioning like the scissors cut the tall ones
Due to hunger not in flesh
high as the spears was present always
Cause it wanted me to feel life without life
reborning the slaves
nevertheless dispersal of ironstakes
to have becomed itself disinfection
The dragon of blasphemy
many others came
but all in one
theres a lot more
my invisible self
has brought to me
a circle to roam
The scares we prayed for
and was given
to rape the mission
of the impaled desiples
and worship him again
We nailed the enemy
dream hopefully and fear the rest
for we look upon the toombs
and dance so they see we woke it
sweapt in shiny sacreligious
for fading light and its Lord
wondering how the wishes spoke
Weak and wise has left
and touched the shade of my tempted ones
dance on the sheppards shadow
and the heretic eyes who saw the sun
Kept his secret always
We believed in those of such poems
as grace has left its mark
an error on our dark illusions
we walk by them for a soul to open
Its power saw us grow
as they lay there
rotting in the hands of God
The storm has driven with fury fall
again and again for noble halls screaming
we heard and spoke to them
for no comforting words to give
We were the shields
When the ancient dwelled in us
and we killed their nextborn in the thronehall
Sons of God die with your once beauty
and feel the blood runs faster
Ages
Brighter then they seemed
and held their withered roses
a sign of a dying God
It saw it
bells of them
POSSESS ME
In this undeadly raven eyes
layes winterstones of buried flesh
once held high by mortal men
holy and miserable
Then on my next gravethrone
I choose the thoughts for each colour
thrown upon lovly wall
for graceful visions and dreams
In the tunnel through fantasy and madness
trancemagic of my dimension
silent as the grave
By every passing curl
is each the shadows beneath
my glorious creations
Is my highest immortal
like the roses feared
or have the flute
played us false tunes
in broken glass
Oblivion owned to live
he had never seen his coffin
and what was made from there
he had never tasted his tears
Can we trespass now
Never dream again
cause this world became the dreams
surely he would wonder about his steps
would always remember the past
What past Times
He would strive on and on
collecting his peace entangled
in crayons the most valuable of all
Out of the dismal mist
covering the crown
he stands like a sculpture
in a flowered garden
black and enameled roses
Can this forsakened deem
lay its hand on the final grasp
Here I was in a distant vision see me come
see me come like a wolf in the wind
to tear this world apart
See me in the gate
in another mirror
laying far above the surface
and from here I come
the vanishing of mercy
See me come
like a wolf in the wind
with the whine of my star
reflect your shape
and your one with the pain
for in my sword
I hide the thruth
See me come
a demon in the storm
pissing on your dreams
Armageddon builds a newborn dimension
for kings and angel slaves
This sun wakened
your time has come
total destruction
armageddon
The sword is grinded
Angel death
I said to myself
can you memorize
come home with the eyes
where you draw your thorn
to the lords above
make sure they are ready
dead already
ignorant fools
The sword is grinded
Angel death
SOLEMNITY
Am I
What is forsakened
canyons of heaven
my passage only
marble the insight
give me back
I know where you have been
drink my acid
the wavy lake of dispear
Facing the reflex
the eyes of death
unity mental extacy
metallic vains
I am highlife naked
it has no longer flesh
The God was untolerated
no redeem of it's palace
I took another turn
I mingeled with the spirits
made pale as ever before
I brought into my own light
He could have called me
Lucifer eat my movements
For whom the glue slips down
on croshed to the star
Drops of gold
like those who once were gray
This is not a black world
The noises departure of a soul
released moving moving
meet me on the moon
Enraptured in astral creations
Unholy distortion
holy for him
black atonements
shifting the grief
Over a crystal landscape
we formed the living creatures
and made you wonder
spiteful alien warriors
Kill they said
and twisted into enigmatic survival
engulfed by supreme art
and a thousand bloody covenants
for intolerants and hate
Threatened ten by ten
that warmed the growing seed
fulfilling the heart of light
I hold the holy in my hands
and all its lifeforms
DEATH
Sown into my darkest hour
darkest spirit roams with us
in moonlight dance the starlight waltz
I grant myself a state of life
Your mountain seemed so high to climb
where I held the light of another world
through the dreamworld cyclone
and rest forever moreThe lurker in the green sea
shades of a moving object
riches the temple that approaches
haunts my wishes of this insanity
gorgeous console I place there my claws
those who once ripped out my eyes
I need no longer human senses
Feel it how this can torture
the wagon with imaginations
scary glimpses with dreadful outlines
things I wish not to see
slaughtering my dearest throne
We will not be affected by this
for the blood of time has fornicated
Our minds our shell
my only shelter
the dreamt with delight
I see my options
and I choose the tunnel
see what my winged crayons
have painted
Let me shed a tear
and give birth to my sea
The only life is death
Speak of the armer
forgotten by reality
speak of the pearls
in crossing unnatural fragments
Perplex in a mortal disguise suddenly awared
Forbidden alowements in my mindwar
functioning like the scissors cut the tall ones
Due to hunger not in flesh
high as the spears was present always
Cause it wanted me to feel life without life
reborning the slaves
nevertheless dispersal of ironstakes
to have becomed itself disinfection
The dragon of blasphemy
many others came
but all in one
theres a lot more
my invisible self
has brought to me
a circle to roam
The scares we prayed for
and was given
to rape the mission
of the impaled desiples
and worship him again
We nailed the enemy
dream hopefully and fear the rest
for we look upon the toombs
and dance so they see we woke it
sweapt in shiny sacreligious
for fading light and its Lord
wondering how the wishes spoke
Weak and wise has left
and touched the shade of my tempted ones
dance on the sheppards shadow
and the heretic eyes who saw the sun
Kept his secret always
We believed in those of such poems
as grace has left its mark
an error on our dark illusions
we walk by them for a soul to open
Its power saw us grow
as they lay there
rotting in the hands of God
The storm has driven with fury fall
again and again for noble halls screaming
we heard and spoke to them
for no comforting words to give
We were the shields
When the ancient dwelled in us
and we killed their nextborn in the thronehall
Sons of God die with your once beauty
and feel the blood runs faster
Ages
Brighter then they seemed
and held their withered roses
a sign of a dying God

and rest forever more
Bare hands
Bones crack
Skin is slack
Clickety clack
Goodnight
Mister nobody is back
Behind the sofa
Memories crawl
Scribbling all the while
On a contorted soul
A reluctant reply
Jagged and morose
Avenge me
Outlandish journey
Voice the recluse
Closing the book
Opens the nose
A sick compromise
For the true heroes of justice
He passed this curse
On to me
I have to bear
In my blackened brain
Forever striving for justice
Nonrefundable soul receipt
A paycheck that never clears
A currency of pain
Blood sweat and tears
Symmetry to necessity
My inseparable master
Shoot to kill
Shoot to kill
Forever indebted to hell
Symmetry to necessity
The ultimate master
Shoot to kill
Shoot to kill
Forever indebted to hell
Fresh fuel for the firing squad
A glint in the hitlist
Begging for mercy
Like a smiling sailor back from the sea
The five decays of human deceit
As the genius who fought himself could see
DrJackal and formaldehyde's last mystery
Twin cohorts in devilish design
Legends of the supervillain industry
Symmetry to necessity
My inseparable master
Shoot to kill
Shoot to kill
Forever indebted to hell
Symmetry to necessity
The ultimate master
Shoot to kill
Shoot to kill
Forever indebted to hell
The castle of death
Gets under your skin
Like a fucking virus
Ushering you in
This body of bile
This body of needs
The world is transparent
You will never leave
Ride the paranoia
All life is pain
Only the Grave
Is real
Spitting the salt
Chalked out for good
Clutching your marbles
Dead as fog
Iron teeth turn the weeds
This fallow soul bleeds for me
Practising suicides
Introvert sadist mindfucker
This method is mantric
Curled up for the carver
On the broken saddle
Redsuckled with fear
Flogging the saints
For wasted days
Bone palace greed
shunning the poison
Gritted ground gears
Barricaded youth
Born on your knees
Toll to bell  Horror
Sheds rusty tears
The snuff dreams are made of
The pendulum stops
Every mouth chews the silence
Minds fold over at the edges
Lonely riders
Strange bed
Long trip
Intestinal breath
Family stacked
In a tool shed
10  year erection
After all the humans are dead
Burning assholes
Vampire dreams
Swimming pool murder scenes
Schizophrenic marriage
To your own flesh
Stranger's lips
Whisper something through
Wire Mesh
All the monsters will break your heart
The future gave up
Emotionally bankrupt
No fear or remorse
Brought up on old nightmares
And life goes on going nowhere
Grim fortune
Spurned friends
The road alone
Between us and nothing
The sky in transit
Salt sad salute
Sober no more
Gnawing at my own bones
Weak revenge of the fierce
Post your prayers to the
Apocalypse
On the run
On the run
Into the slung lips
And adhesive arms
of the strange one
All the monsters will break your heart
The future gave up
Emotionally bankrupt
No fear or remorse
Brought up on old nightmares
And life goes on going nowhere
In this light
We'd look good
With our teeth smashed out
Hunger and clouds
I'll never be clean again
Mercy is only
A bullet in the brow
Do it or die
Never is now
A skull of worms
Like a tin can crown
Building you up
Just to knock you down
1 billion bones
1 million moans
Bring them down
Foe by foe
Keep your friends close
But your enemies even closer
And bring them down
Foe by foe
Too many ghouls
Under slate roofs
To many cuckoos
Fattening the roost
There's not enough gold
To bury them all
To many thoughts
For one to many fools
Build a giant tomb
For the earth to go
Smuggle their souls
In a suitcase of woe
Too much fatigue
Sweeps through the streets
Too much saccharin
And not enough anger
Trading blows
To lighten the load
Bring them down
Foe by foe
Stepping on your toes
Elbows to the bone
Bringing you down
Foe by foe
Skin boiled in lead
By the words of a friend
With another mans face
In the back of their head
Betrayed to the end
By the living dead
Smashing your heart
With emotional dread
Read my lips
I burnt bridges for this
For volcanoes of flesh
To devour my limbs
Body meat beat
Dogbark drone scream
A billion doors of hate
To a brand new being
Old plutonium
Iron skeleton
Murder gutter
Sodomised mother
Clinical research
Auto fatality
Accident mode
Abdominal injuries
Unpleasant mechanism
Rainwashed test area
Human flesh radiator
Concrete zombie fugitive
Inanimate mannequin
Pretty black bullets
Across abandoned landscape
Fingers bruise a new nerve
Cardiovascular grass verge
Neural discharge
Blood flecks across the polished paintwork
Geometry of bodies
Titanium terrace of agony
Mechanical arousal
With mouthparts removed
Simultaneous international crucifixion
Nailed to each others fantasies
Brains blown out across the universe
Mass merchandise of your emotions
Sold to middle income housewives
Repetition of execution sequence
Playback over and over again
Psychosexual awerness of an infant generation
Warmed up chloroform thoughforms
Interested more in wounds
Than sores
Meat grinder sick smiles
Find some fear and stay there
For a while
Gluespine umbilical hutch
Creating cold electric current
Nervous universes
Dervishes of the fiery furnace
Gun down an entire classroom
Photographs of genital mutilations
A glutton for putrefaction
In early stages of formation
The need to feel loved
While fucking it up
You can't kill the thrill
Roll up
Roll up
Come see the oddities
Unaltered beasts
Or the girl who swallowed knives
The invisible cannibal
The strangest foe of all time
For your own very eyes
Come see the freaks
Come see the freaks
Children made of raw meat
Shark mouths of blazing impurity
Down in the dumps
Down in the doldrums
Where only the fucked up
Forage for their forms
Nervous twitches at 2AM
In a bed of cracked ribs
Jerking off in a circus of secrets
Pressure sweating you slowly insane
We all become new fanged Gods
To old for regret
To ill for death
I trust myself and no one else
I drink to your bad health
Like the carrion fiend
At a blessed feast
The bones you were born with
Yearn to be seen
An imperfect fake with the same name
Searching for language
Of an inner being
Jackhammer magnificent
Chainsaw Buddhist
Unspoilt and unbeautiful
Arrogant until proven guilty
The heart is deceased above all things
Inflammatory flawed creation
Plastic dolls for the role models
Bedraggled in bad guts
Home to dogtown pillbox
Let's go out and live in an illusion together
Wash your mouth out with lies
Searching in vain forever
For one of your own kind
A human cannonball
Boiled beaten an bleak brown
Miserable odes tiled on your skull
A scholar of war on a bonegrinding railroad
Small town sweatheart in a sordid bloodbath
Memories and anecdotes kicked in the face
Like a railroad of blind windows
Butchered in the snow
Crumpled angel at the end of the avenue
Making shapes from strangers faces
An empty disguise
With nowhere to go
A soldier comes home from the war
To four walls
And nothing
Children search for their parents
Forever
But they keep on looking
A father returns home from work
And murders his family
A priest looses his faith in God
His formative years steered in tragedy
Politicians become impostors
Comforting words of the backwoodsmen
A troubled drifter with a guilty past
A cabin of corpses by an old dirt track
This is the dawn of the apocalypse
Open your heart to the apocalypse
I want to watch you burn in the apocalypse
I'll make you learn for the apocalypse
An elderly couple sit by the fire
With gunshot wounds to the skull
A talk show host is found face down
In a public swimming pool
A corrupt official abuses his position
An old vagrant in the park
Mutilated beyond recognition
International leaders break down on live TV
The suicide of an old school master
Miserable and lonely
This is the dawn of the apocalypse
Open your heart to the apocalypse
I want to watch you burn in the apocalypse
I'll make you learn for the apocalypse
In urge to become something
believed to be more infact
I pursue the whole
Of human Dementia
You know when your catastrophy
Is utterly complete
Only when you shut your eyes
For the truth
And for the worse
There's no place within your mind
When all faces are set on fire
To burn for the honour
Of the pain in your heart
And fade in the focus
Of your cursed lust
Ghostforce climax
Soul Constrictor
A fountainhead of disorder
A splinted human codex
Ghostforce
Soul constrictor
I cry out
For the death of my guardian angels
No more navigating
The labyrinth of selfdeceit
The one we share with a psyche
Almost Obsolete
Without a ground to stand on
Down the ladder
Where we all break down
The soul murder armoury is ready to go
So I blow up my sense of logic
Deluded in default
To separate the alternative
Stifled by the conscious mind
Hell made real by the terror of strife
And right from the core of hysteria
Where suffering seems to grant no end
In the absence of free flow
A trance of flames
With no exit
In the cold neurotic night
I can't bring myself to tell you
I'm not who you thought I am
And I'd laugh until I died
I'm leading a quiet life
At an abandoned casino of nightmares
As if a stranger's face
Came home to play
And I lost my way
Something is missing
All day long
The light leaves lines of panic on the vine
It doesn't matter how hard you try
Wraiths astride tame tigers
We're tied to altars in the sky
If an abstract shell
Of a man remains
I won't be the same again
Driving nails between my teeth
Kicked to my feet
No sleep for weeks
Sucking the dust from the cage
Varicose veins and mind games
Guzzling barrels of skinstripping shit
A festering drink of facebreaking cocksucker
Fashionably possessed
Planning world downfall from my bed
Supping the villainous sap
Garden of mutants begin to clap
And now there's no turning back
Alone against everything
Freaking out
Reeking in
Minds wide open
Fix an appointment with God
Your futile trip is done
At the ruins of visionary self
They'll be cutting their hands off
In hell tomorrow
A truth that's easy to swallow
Fastacting and thorough
Locked away
Brainwashed
And left alone
Out damned spot
Out damned spot
Out damned spot
Home sick home
Home sick home
Home sick home
The world really gets my back up
An airline that never stops crashing
An itch that never stops itching
Living in an insatiable video game
Vengeance stalks my brain
Pimping bag of creaking bones
Collapsing inwards from skin to soul
Slime alley black cockroach
Labyrinth of solitude in my throat
Guts filled up with the voices of hate
Homogenised venom eats the smile from your face
Tongue splits on the taste
As sanity separates
Reflection you gleam is disfigured and displeased
Adding insult to injury
In swaggering fury
Weak sick
Dread freak
With reservation seats to the funeral of the world
It has come to swallow the sea
It invades every being
It has come to consume the city
And it will complete me
It will give us all the answers
But tell us nothing
It will dance on our dead bodies
Because we are the willing victims
It is myriad consciousness
of all arthritic love
It stole my laughter and joy
When it drowned the world
It is the future of seeing without looking
The great cosmic riddle
21st century devil
It is the hidden king
Of unknown roads
It is the scars of a jilted lover
It relieves the believers
With unmerciful magic
It is not eternity
It is not hope
It is the hum
It is the friction
It is here
It is thereThe choice between the devil you know and the devil you don't
Use force to coerce compliance
Use force if they don't
You can slit their throats from ear to ear or put a noose tight 'round their neck
They won't kneel
We can't covert them
We can bomb their homes from up above and burn down what is left
They won't surrender
We'll never break the will they have
Pariah
We're creating the hatred
We're combating the hatred we create
Is nothing sacred
No
The snake that eats its own tail destroys itself
Compromise innocent lives in the name of wealth almighty
Slit their throats from ear to ear or put a noose tight 'round their neck
Bomb their homes from up above and burn down what is left
Cut the limbs off of a child and the public buts the check
Who cuts the check
Pariah
Beat the ploughshares into swords
Initiate a state of perpetual quarrel this shall never end
Keep the coffers full
Keep their coffins full
Feed them fear to keep them tame the king proclaimed
You don't want what I want I see it in your eyes
You don't burn like I burn and even if you tried you can't see what I see knowing what's inside
You can't see what I see
I know what you hide
I'm wideawake
Wide
I'm wideawake
I see the moves that you're trying to make
You think I'm sleeping be I'm wideawake
All this spinning makes me dizzy
It makes me sick
Colorcoded fear to ensure you fall in line when they crack the whip
I'm not scared
I'm wideawake
Do you really trust the things they feed you in the news
Corporations own the networks that help to skew our views
I'm not fooled
I see the moves that you're trying to make
You think I'm sleeping but I'm wideawake
I know the moves you're trying to make
You want me sleeping but I'm wideawake
Like a fault line moving beneath our feet slipping slowly you barely notice
Until the ground gives way beneath you and the world crumbles down around you
You want me under
Put me under
Put me under
Put me under
Wide Awake
One man fights to keep his pockets fat
Another is fighting just to pay his bills
Some go to doctors for the vanity others can't even afford their pills
The distance between us grows
Just how numb have we become
Look how far we've grown apart
Some show their love for the land by stopping and asking Why
Others show support for a war by sending their sons off to die
The distance between us grows
Just how numb have we become
What have we become
Look how far we've grown apart
Now I won't talk to you and you won't talk to me
And I might look away but you will never see the distance between
race
religion class
education
Sexual orientation
Political affiliation
We'll never see eye to eye
This distance will keep on growing and growing and growing
Lessen programs promoting contraception if it means protection in the next election
Religious groups will keep sending those checks in so we can start wars and keep sending those jets in
Exactly just what kinda shit did we step in
Exactly just what kinda message we sending
It don't matter if you condemn condoms it ain't your problem
it's the type of thing that only happens in Harlem
Happens in Compton happens in Newark it happens in Houston
I think we got a problem Houston
Invoke God to camouflage your true sins
Poke and prod private life intrusions
You say it's for our safety when you spy our movements
huh well I don't buy it doofus I ain't stupid this is my two cents
You don't know what it's like to pray
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like to pray for God to turn the night to day
Do you know what it's like to pray
Do you know what it's like
Do you know what it's like to pray for god to turn the night to day
Let's spend some real money on real life improvements
Instead of moon men and booing same sex unions
We need to take a look at why society is loosing
One room shack a single mother with two kids
They share the same bed and the walls are too thin
So they hear every fight
Fourth grade kids who can't read or write
And all they ever hear in mommy beat at night
They can't sleep at night they can't catch no Z's
So what the fuck they care about the ABC's
It's crazy kids in grades 1 2 3
Trying to decide whether to be a B or C
Their stomachs are empty there's not enough MD's but we can spend millions chasing WMD's
Or we can just build a pipeline in the mideast
And when the bill comes send it to me
You don't know what it's like to pray
You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like to pray for God to turn the night to day
Do you know what it's like to pray
Do you know what it's like
Do you know what it's like to pray for god to turn the night to day
A bid farewell in pools of crimson
A rose colored lullaby
There can be no justice it can't be taken back
All the evil deeds you've done have left your hands all covered in the  Blood
You can never make amends for the blood
One day you'll suffer for your sins 
Massacres on top of slaughters
To feed the drive that keeps a man that has still wanting more
Like the Great White in the water
The downtrodden have always paid the price through ther tears and  Blood
You can never make amends for the blood
One day you'll suffer for your sins 
Try to erase but you won't ever atone for all the horrors that will never wash away
Johnny never went to college
He couldn't afford the fee
He got lucky he had an uncle who worked for NBC
Now Johnny's taking for people who shop from the TV
Mostly wealthy housewives who buy expensive jewerly
It's a setup to keep you down They set up you then knock you
Johnny got laidoff his job sent overseas
He made about 50 bucks day his replacement $3
My mother never had much money my grades were never all that great
So how fuck am I supposed to learn if eduation cost more than I make
And how fuck the am I supposed to earn when good jobs want a college degree
Seven bucks an hour what kind of future does that leave for me
It's a setup to keep you down They set up you then knock you2x
Johnny's is going through some tough times and barely making both ends meet
He can't find a jod on account of the economy
Johnny's feeling desperate
He's got kids to feed
So the day I met Johnny he robbing me
Trying so hard to forget to remember
One sip to take the sorrow
One sip to face tomorrow
Sip swallow your pride wallow and hide
Hollow inside and I wish
That I could take the sun and make it shine
Take your pain and make it mine
I can't do anything at all
I can't keep catching when you fall
If I can't do anything at all what can I do
Open the bottle and erase your memories
Stumble and fall sipping and slipping away from it all
Take your pain and make it mine
Take the sun and make it shine
Take your shoes and walk in mine
Walk in mine
Black clouds take hold like a pit bull when it locks it's jaws
Trouble always had a funny way of finding some kind of path into my life
I had to stand and fight
I won't run
I won't hide
I'll stand and fight
Thought I told ya'll when I sang before
Better get an umbrella when it rains it pours
We can bang 'cause I'm made for war
If I get knocked down then I'll aim for more
Lash out like a rat in a corner with it's back to the wall
Trouble always had a funny way of finding some kind of path into my life
I had to stand and fight
I won't run
I won't hide
I'll stand and fight
Thought I told ya'll when I sang before
Better get an umbrella when it rains it pours
We can bang 'cause I'm made for war
If I get knocked down then I'll aim for more
I spit metaphors for them kids with the souls that's lost
We're here and we ain't fall off
Talking soft
Your shit gets tossed
You can never know how hard we fought
Feels like I'm breaking down
Things have to turn around
I just can't take it
It feels like I'm breaking down
I just can't make it
And I pick myself off of the floor
I waited to fight some more
Thought I told ya'll when I sang before
Better get an umbrella when it rains it pours
We can bang 'cause I'm made for war
If I get knocked down then I'll aim for more
I spit metaphors for them kids with the souls that's lost
We're here and we ain't fall off
Talking soft
Your shit gets tossed
You can never know how hard we fought
Basicly I was just born bastard long for green pastures
I am a pheonix I was born from the ashes
The forms you take in the storm is what you makes strong
Anybody could perfrom like a charm when the waters calm
Ya'll don't know nathan 'bout the things I've been faced with
Can ya'll relate how I came from the basement
I make the music and the same time faced it
I've been so close to my dreams I can taste it
Come on and punish me the only thing that keeps me sane
I look to you for things I can not change
I need your blessing do you approve
My best was never good enough for you
So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good
To you couldnt give enough after giving all you could
Its been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine
I've been losing for so long I think I fell too far behind
I've swam beneath the icy waters not comming up for air
I've spent my whole life living for those who didn't even care
So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good
To know you couldnt give enough after giving all you could
Its been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine
I've been losing for so long I think I fell too far behind
I sat and thought for a while today
I got depressed and put the smiles away 'cause I've been struggling
Since back in my childhood days I've been walkin' since forever still I'm miles away
Maybe ya'll never forgave for my wilder days
Even though now I'm more wise in my ways
I'm losing faith in myself
Sometimes I doubt I'll even make it myself
Whose gonna give it to me if I don't take it myself
Come on and punish me the only thing that keeps me sane
I look to you for things I can not change
I need your blessing do you approve
My best was never good enough for you
So this is how it feels and it doesn't feel so good
To know you couldnt give enough after giving all you could
Its been raining for so long its like the sun will never shine
I've been losing for so long I think I fell too far behind

Judas the only one who hasn't lied to us
You remain faithful by showing
the world hypocrite and merciless
in the name of the demons and the powers of hell
Christians I damn you making the sign of pentagram
I do call you great Master Satan
from the bottom of darkness the strengths breakout
I feel them ready to bit
I made serious offenses and lived like a sinner
Ave Satan ave ave ave
To satisfy my love for you
Oooh Satan's servant
I grave my soul
I adjured the blood that flows in my veins
And shall continue to an immortal life
life in your name life
Reborn through the breeze in a snowstorm
in front of thirteen black brilliants candles
reflecting under my eyes and letting reappear
the Medieval visions of my ancient empire
Prince Lucifer powerful you buried my corpse
and keep my spirit to challenge the good in the
name of evil and to declare an endless war
with the torment of the infernal legions
I'm the son of the moon emperor of the war
I'm the one who unleash the hate
I'm the denial of all benevolence
I prepare my holocaust
I shall kill without pity
I raise the inverted cross in the nightside eclipse
His eyes shall watch me in battle
Under the storming holocaustsky
thy kingdom of heaven will be destroyed forevermore
under the throne of the horned king
under the sign of the horned one
The whole universe will then recognize
the supreme power of Satan who will retake
his throne for eternity and will reign forever
Beyond the snowclad hills and the icy mountains
a vast field of crucified and impaled is stretching
They're perishing in the blackness of darkness
and soulless of their soul
for centuries lost in Lucifer's kingdom
And endlessly the bloody rivers flows
And the maleficiant strengths delivered from
their abyss are raging
Again the empire of evil
will shine and my domain of terror
will keep his powerful majesty
under the glittering brillance of the moon
and under the sign of the great iron hammer sign of Thor
Alone in my sinister crypt I evoke the ancients
I raise my chalice of pure blood sacrificed angels
towards the moon and I cry my reading
my sorcellery breeding the infernal awakening
The winds is changed on fire in a cyclone
the prophets coming from nowhere
show the eternity paths
the no return ways
lost in the depth of gloomy forests from the North
The fog of the new moon
effaces the engraved epitaphs on a medieval tombs
but the accursed winds are rising
calling the vampires from their sleep
the creatures of apocalypse
And it's throughout the incessant fire
that the apparition is revealed dark
surmounted by two large horns
the goat master came more deeply from darkness
to punish the profane and reward is faithful
The darkwinds breakout all their rage
frighten and take away
blessed souls of the damned
in the domain of abomination
I have opened the gates of chaos
on this alive and holy world
Nobody will e able to close them forever
Forever
Immersed in my hypnotic slumber
I wander through the paths of a cemetery
In an unhearithy night the high storms break the fire of sky
I hear the call as I go to a grave
the crypt of the demons is calling me
for the darkness ceremony
where the tales of ancient hordes will be recited
and the blasphemy will be sung
Through the glaring lightning
my decomposed face
and my skeletal body project
a terrifying shadow on the burial ground
Ouuuhhh Master Satan
By your power bless my body
dead for centuries
Among the blackness icy previaled
I draw the black curtain of death
thousand of lost souls fallen
in the depth of the crypts of pain
through the voices of the past
The angles of damnation follow me
travel through the foot lost paths
the huge black forests
during the eternal nights of a funeral winter
Drowned in the shadow
light the kingdom of deads
has condemned my soul
has haunted the hibernal forests
My coffin burn in a chapel
by the flames of damnation
will still remain now and forever
in a ceremony of the shadows of the past
And the souls will recall the way of my cremation
with the singing the voices of the night
on the threshold at the gates of the kingdom
of the shadows behold the moonlike throne
I cry for my anterior life
but at dawn of my rebirth
and by the power of my blasphemy
I raise with the forces of evil
my curse is eternal
The wolves howling their song
towards the gates of hell
the Northern abysses let to hear
among these leed north winds
the weeps of victims sacrificed
to bloody rites of ShubNiggurath
the black goat of the eternal woods
When the night is deep
and the sun is in the sign of Ram
the chant of darkness will be uttered
towards the Northern winds
The key will be turned
and the gates will open
facing us in the darkend kingdom
The black Northern winds swept the dust
who covered my ancient tomb
The prophecy of the ancient millenary
call the horde of the goat
Darkness entomb the souls of the saints
sentenced in front of the goathrone
Sacrificial
Drinking the blood
Ritual
Burn the crypt
The unhealthy moonlight rise my altar of corporal sacrifice
On a ground cover of ice
the ritual of Northern fullmoon
the desire of infernal majesty
the submissiveness of the Black Pentagram
The clouds of blood watch for again their immediate victims
Thundering through the endless woods
let by the sound of the Bjallarhorn
they resounded from beyond the Skjeldenland
Clinching with their swords they attack
after hearing the Heimdall's sign to charge
the sign to ride over Skjeldenland
Ending with the roman dominion
they hail the restoration of the pagandom
burning down the churches with their pagan fire
they do it with ancestral northern hate
piling sacred temples of the feeble Christ
They steal the golden call in offering to Odin
Hailing under the blackened skies of Norway
the raven's claw signed the northern hordes
to charge to ride all over the Skjeldenland
Claiming their Viking victories in Flanders
as rival they have the Vlanderesns striders
who are daring to keep the Flemish empire
A silver fullmoon glows on a winter night
sometimes hidden by clouds and Midgard's fire
reflecting and resounding with Thor's strikes
all over the pagan fields of the Skjeldenland
Freezing icecold pagan fullmoon winter nights
Northwinds are howling like hungry wolves
they victimize but the Viking horde invade the frozen winter
They pile the profaned churches and hail the pagan fire
Asgardsveien are their paths from the Hordanes land
Rising high their swords they conquer the Skjeldenland
Hail Skjeldenland
A tremendous horned shadow
appeared in the red wintersky
The unbearable resounding of the pagan bells
awake the souls of their tombs
Hades calls them in front of the almighty throne
for the gathering of the black pact
I've been dead for centuries
Today again my evil spirit
celebrate the millenary of Satan
in the freezing chapel of demons
my delight is to hear the sputtering of heaven in fire
With my Baphometic horde
I desecrate the holy tombs
I destroy the virgin edifices
I invert the holy cross
In the name of profanation
I hail Baphomet
At the sound of the millennium black bells
time has come for me
to return in my paragon tomb
for a perpetual slumber
under the dark eyes of Belial
for a dark eternity
Awakened by the wolves howlings
watching out within the castle's walls
I saw the fullmoon guiding my life
A thick fog covers the landscape
the fiibulwinter is arriving
the darkness is here
ancient times are calling
I start to remember
I adore my ancestors for their braveness
They fought for their believes
they had realized the truth
They denied all others beliefs
and so do I
As night is rising I hear a distant voice
he is calling my name
I listen with pride
As ancient kingdoms rise
Beyond the great mountains of Frost
the knowledge lies within
I hear a distant voice from the dark forest
I must leave the forsaken world
I ride the winds of Frost to my home
As darkness rises
the fog appears in the night
in the distant a castle appears
Longing for those old times
the moonlight guides me on my journey
I follow the moon
for it shall lead me home
suddenly I arrive at the castle
my ancestors had right
I trust them with whole my heart
Raise the seventh sword of NinnageshRisen from the dead
To kill dismember and behead
Prepare to be ripped and torn
Entrails is now reborn
The story was told
The crypt was old
We have a confession
The evil obsession
Evening in a tormenting crypt
Chains around your neck
Food once a week lifetime to die
Dead flesh flowing out of your ass
Reborn to society
Crawl with anxiety
Pain from lost mind
No one can find
Death and smelly corpse
Buried in the walls
Graveyard in the garden
Their souls shall be reborn
Night in the cold
You were working at the morgue
Have no friends was alone
There was nothing else to do
Flames from fire in a room
Questions in your head
What should I do now
Should I run or should I die
There was a room with a corpse of fire
Moaning souls flowing through the walls
Panic reactions grab your back
Heat from flames you begin to burn
You felt the skin fall off
Dark memories from the past
Memories that should end
If you would die
Scarred and burned
You found some water
After that night
The wound seems to heal
Two years later
You were walking in the morgue
The same scary noise
From flames in to the room with corpse
Voices tells me what to say and do
Nothing pleasant but I want to
Evil pleasures in my fantasies
Not enough NO Not enough for me
Voices  Hell bound
Voices  Blood spill
Voices  Carnage
EVIL  voices
Am I evil or am I just insane
Am I a pervert totally deranged
But I like the nasty thing I do
Living out my fantasy on you
Nothing could stop me from hurting you
Seeing you fear makes my dream come true
Evil pleasures in my fantasy
Not enough NO Not enough for me
Sinners shall burn
To a melting stuff
Great kingdom shall rise
Cause of sinners doom
Memories from that time
Slowly rot away
No one misses their friend
Cause sinners shall burn in hell
Make some noise
Scream and exterminate
Violence to hell
The sinners are born again
Ruin the world
Fight the life
Of remaining crowd
Your doom is near
For nothing the pain ends
Be drunk to kill again
So be to the great pain
And rise from the grave again
The enemy will get away
And stand gone forever
No threat to the people
The peace finally arrives
Fighting death to death
To create some life
Life who shall win
Against the dark hell
Flowing power makes
Me to win at last
Death shall be reborn
Triumph of the sinners
Clouds in the sky
Rain pouring down
Protect your head
Lightning strikes again
Stormy weather
Blood on leather
Death is rising
Blood is flowing
Piles of flesh and bones
Ripped off by the dead
Awakened by the storm
You're now without head
We are all helpless
Weather have such power
Black clouds are forming
They want you dead
Cloud dark and ugly
Thunder can be heard
Give me your best shot
Goodbye bastards
Being all alone at midnight
Walking through the cemetery
The moon in full it freaks me out
The earth begins to quake
I turn my head around my shoulder
And see a hand coming from the ground
Thinking what the fuck is going on
The gate is locked I am trapped
The dead are walking at the cemetery
Hungry for flesh and thirsty for blood
A thick fog of rotten stench
I try to hide from the shadows of death
They seek for human souls
Empty my head and scream for my life
I had to make my escaping clear
How to run how to hide
Grabbed a pole and began to smash
Their heads cracked as they fell to the ground
I was killing zombies that night
Dead things drooling for my flesh
What the hell woke 'em up
Can I somehow make them die
I was running I was hiding
Looking for a thing to do
Found a gas can spread the fuel
Lit a fire and made them burn
I know the time
When you grow up
Time has not changed
After your parents' death
Time after that
You were paralysed
No family to go to
Took care of your self
Death can see
More than you know
Death can strike
Wherever you go
Your parents they died
By force they were killed
Blood in throat breath of blood
Now in this time
A big and a powerful world
You still remember
Your parents' death
Shadows the dark place in chaos
Entrails the waste from the flesh
Dry blood red as it can be
Disintegration decay from rotten bones
Entrails a tasty entrail
Flesh and blood
Dinner for two
Show me some death
Autopsy the final way to die
Raw meat taste the smell of fear
Coffin silence in the grave
Die
I am the slayer
You are the victim
All shall face the death
Soon you will die
Graveyard The end of destination
Undefeated soul Anger for mankind
Worn out To stand by your own
Immortality I shall rise again
I am the word of hate made flesh
Demon Black immortal soul
Genesisat a pool of stinking filth
And again the images unfurl
From me the crimson strings unfold to infinite lengths and points untold
To conquer time alone by willto BEforever more
Apoditic evil in the arms of the Unlight
Tribesmen turn from Starside skies
and venture not unto the north
As doctrine to their lives
a fear of death or worse
Cimmerian recursive soulthe force from which the fountain flows
tributaries in worlds beyond to snuff the lie of light
Enslaved creation molding man as mine or be destroyed
Sheathing drops which fall to earth
and freeze within the night
Sculpt the northern towers high
antithetic windswept plains
From behind the eyes from within I writhe
With preternatural sense I feel the scarlet flow of life nearby
To mesmerize
The hypnotic beauty in these eyes
Seek in me and you'll find
The truth you so design
Brilliant infinity
I'll send you on your way
From me the crimson strings unfold to infinite lengths and points untold
To conquer time alone by willto BEforever more
Apoditic evil in the arms of the Unlight
A scene of time flashes across the mind of the ancient one 
defender and chosen soul  above all by SHE  
One of the isochronal encounters of Night's Warrior  
Forever  the solitary legatee of HER gift and raptured soul unto SHE 
he engages the weakened forces of light in the eternal affray
forever to be champion
Upon the sea of time I ride
to stay abreast of rising tides
I cast a scornfilled glance about
this body black through which I pass
Time of the Gathering disseminated troops advance upon the source
Source of the pale and the jewel of the night
Lead by HER desire SHE twists their threads to knot
When at her peak in full  high
While I have she to be my guide
I will but champion the night
And rend  my odium to the rest
Hour at hand a force arrives with blades in hand
And in their haste a claim to SHE is made to which I stand
And ending yet another's quest the moonbleached flesh is all that stands
avoiding cosmic undertow
my thoughts change course
immortal beauty embracing me
 and beckons forth
a brighter thread unseen by all
when burst into existence
her silver lips upon my brow
as praise to crimson glory
so enchanting in her lust
in rapture to her bidding
Find in me your way through this
My gifts are yours to wield alone
avoiding cosmic undertow
my thoughts change course
immortal beauty embracing me
A pounding Lust to know her face
A life to glimpse her shade
As candle's wick may burn to end
So quickly does light fade
Thirsting With a lust that knows no bounds
I RideInto night and further into
BattleWith gauntlets raised and piercing cries
The infinite flow of her womb
The poignant spring from which all life doth bloom
Now matched alone by the myriad of bones
Broken seeping life within the ravaged battled garden
The Motherof man must now dry her wetted
Eyes for it is upon her bitter sweet
Nectar I wish to glut
And so doing ascend in might
With power over all I rule
Ere the War
Storms on horizon the ancient hands of time align
Thunders toll the final hour of the mortals down below
Eli Eli lama sabachthani
Earth shakes and gales break upon the red and cracking clay
And spewing forth the raining slag begins to cleanse the fallen ones
Eli Eli lama sabachthani
You'll slowly burn
In hates black fire
Realize the lie
And the truth in pain
Choked by thorns
Blinded by light
The living lie
Burned Away
Father inequity bending down on broken knee
The time of the fiery wrath has now come to pass
Eli Eli lama sabachthani
You'll slowly burn
In hates black fire
Realize the lie
And the truth in pain
Choked by thorns
Blinded by light
The living lie
Burned Away
The blaze that began in the soul of the one
Now sent upon the children of sun
The child of night has now his ascent
And crushed lay the feeble in death's stalwart grip
Searing phlogiston as child rises high
Blinks into darkness when through time he flies
And onto a new terra firma he stands
The cleanser of worlds has arrived
I RideInto night and further into time
Destroyer of lives
What have you done
Your worlds are colliding into one
Of unparalleled proportion
Stop this shift in your morality
What fate holds proves your mortality
This life is as much ours as it is yours
What can be taken from us now
Nothing is left of our brittal bones
Leave us to die where we lay
This contageous disease is our grave
If we must not be woken
Then consider this is where you could have been
Dead in our place
Last sight unseen is your wretched face
Forgiveness is a paradox
And we may never understand it
We will not be forgiven
As long as my body weighs down this planet
So remember what you've done to us
In the back of your mind we lay rotting
This is what fate holds
This life is ours
Your worlds are colliding into one
Of unparrelled proportion
The scales are tipping so where will this weigh
You are the reason this war is waging
Look what you've done to us
This is where you could have been
This silver lining is only a mirage
Held up by the crooked spines of our pasts
As weak as a sheet of paper
Our paper spines will collapse
And we thought they would hold us up
We stare upon this empty junction
What's left for us to conceal
We're sowing seeds of destruction
This crop of lies we must not yield
Count on each finger the lives trapt
Suffering for what cause
Buried beneath your thoughts
Are immanent signs of light in dark
Suppressed by self contradiction
Now release this vile decadence from within you
Upon this place of emptiness
Each spark a spew from within your bowels
Begin a reign of elegance
From thought to mouth
From mouth to speech
Speak out against what we've been told
Lead our nation to a new place
Away from this pit of black
Count on each finger the lives trapt
Suffering for what cause
Billions alive and stagnant
Starving is now a habit
Stop this before we collapse
We can only last so long
Force fed to the point of starvation
Because lies are so unsatisfying
We have let go of this
Nature is no longer on our side
Fighting with it for so long
We eventually wither and die
Struggle has become part of our everyday life
Digging deeper and deeper into rust
Sifting through their ashes
The dead have turned to dust
Multiple realities existing in singularity
A paradox of consequence and unfamiliarity
We eventually wither and die
We've forgot this place and all it's given us
Nature is the host and we are the parasites
Feeding seeking and bleeding her dry
Look what has already been done
Generations fallen look at them
Must we make the same mistakes again
Unbelievable is the adolescence of this world
We know the problem so why not stop this
We do not know show us
We are the unnatural beings that bring destruction to Everything
If I could only show you
Remove the chains and allow this monstrosity to feed
The floodgates have been opened on the weak
Washing out the inconsistency
Overbearing on the land is the sea
Everything is now saturated with confusion
The waters that once quenched our thirst
Is drowning all that drink of it
Misguided to the point of drought
The earth is swallowing us all
You open your mouth we open our eyes
I can see what your trying to do
Unfortunate how you live your lives
Mislead by what you think is truth
Heart of a liar but the face of a leader
Is it that you are confused
Don't pretend like you understand
Remove the chains and allow this monstrosity to feed
The floodgates have been opened on the weak
Washing out all of this noise
We've been in this desert for too long
Now we've been moving in circles
For far too long
Suffocating
You feed the breathless with your failures
Untamed and blameless
You underestimated my true strength
This sea of lies is decaying youth
Consequence cannot bring restortation
To this lifeless surface and spirit of abrasion
End this
It's not for us to decide
Who are we to control this life
Suffocating
Set to be the end from the beginning
Your eagerness to please yourself has brought out this Disgusting wretch
Distorted is your vision of reality
I intend to break you of this selfishness
Daughter what have you done
Suffocating
You feed the lifeless with your failures
Daughter what have you done
I can't believe my eyes
Loved one where have you gone
Was our relationship built on lies
Every misdirect has become clear to me
So beautiful yet so betraying
You are my flesh
I still love every bit of you
I take responsibility it's all on me
I have failed you
Now I will face the universe
The remains of your catastrophy
What have you done
Princess of the universe
Daughter of the northern sky
Lady of the Constellation
You are my design
You are my burden and you are my design
I take responsibility for what is mine
Andromeda what have you done
My daughter come back to meConcepts communication 
Balance domination 
Unseen yet practicable 
Where is your answer 
Where is your question 
Based on truth or lies 
Why should it be either 
Existence unseen 
At beckon call 
Not for those who judge 
What they cannot comprehend 
Source of knowledge too vast for words 
To concentrate your mind 
Of no substance yet food for thought 
And entrance to your soul 
It is both life and death 
It is both death and life 
Fear to some existence to others 
In the air you breathe yet in your mind surreal 
Liars are those who claim to know 
In their words they say nothing 
For words cannot describe it 
It is knowledge and yet confusion 
See all you can 
And look beyond and beyond and beyond 
Look through the confusion to find knowledge 
Look through the knowledge to find confusion 
At all times question everything 
Inside and around I see misery suffering 
A new level of depth for my depression 
Thought I could only climb from now 
Unable to see below its depths 
Got used to it so that it wasn't as bad 
Now on my dark ledge I am falling further 
Where are my friends Someone grasp me 
But no one reaches for I have nothing left to give them 
My use for them is gone and so is their respect for me 
Hitting a deeper level I crash hard 
My anger screams sorrow and hate contorting together 
In a fit my temper explodes tearing my hair punching my face 
Ripping my skin to release it from within 
Screams of sorrow increasing my hate 
Sentences flash through my mind of all that they said 
Of those I regard that hurt me 
Emptying my soul devouring my will 
I'm alone and always will be 
I've known no one who hasn't hurt me  and often with intent 
I walk through crowded streets of faceless people 
Their whispers haunting me 
Trapped in a void with myself who's not me 
My knowledge and power are all that I own 
My compassion is destroyed my hate free to explode 
Now I will always destroy those who try to hurt me 
He that is slow to believe anything and everything is of 
great understanding for belief in one false principle is 
the beginning of all unwisdom 
Slavery 
Followers of the righthand path 
Looking to God for comfort 
Enslaved by his command 
Controlled by priests and bishops 
Conceited are the followers who preach unto others 
Not to follow is to burn in Hell 
Spreading lies about Satanism to enslave the minds of sinners 
Propaganda spread  mass control 
Pay to repent  money for their pleasure 
Brainwashing the weak in mind 
If God is good why should you fear him 
All they want is the feeling of power 
Of having others follow their morals 
All they bring is pain and fear to the ones who are unsure 
Kill these enslavers 
They only want to rule and judge you to satisfy their narrow minds 
Satanism is a way of life 
It is to do whatever will please you 
There are no commandments just follow you instincts 
Never bow down to the lambs of God 
Question the why and wherefore of their commandments 
Why should they be true 
Man's instincts go against selfdenial 
Instincts of indulgence and selfpreservation should come through 
There is no heaven of glory bright and no hell where sinners roast 
Here and now is our day of torment Here and now is our day of joy 
I see them coming at me all the time 
Lashing out killing me over and over again 
And I laugh for I enjoy all the deaths that I receive 
The pain and destruction of my flesh 
Killing me over and over again 
The blackness still comes forever killing me 
I rock back and forth staring through 
The blackness which slices through 
My scarred and dead flesh yet still I die as I see my skin shred 
Dead again and still I stare at the blackness which is still there 
Have they not yet reached the core of my flesh so battered and torn 
Maybe I have no core maybe inside there's nothing 
If so what do I die for 
Staring watching willing killing 
Seeing dreaming screaming screaming 
Killing killing killing killing 
Willing filling what wasn't there emptiness my despair 
Stuck unable to move off my chair 
Rocking back and forth with no eyes yet still I stare 
At the blackness which is always there 
Throughout our childhood we live in fear 
Of all that we hear neverending tears 
Ignorance so absolute within their minds so small 
Into the depths of their shadows we fall 
To live and breathe in sadness pain and agony 
Their mendacious emotions race through me 
Feeling love and hate for someone untrue 
My cauldron of life my feelings subdue 
I am still a child 
Ill prepared guardians take care of our existence 
Without thought to their actions of consequence 
The light of our eyes died while we were conceived 
By the whores and sluts our mothers their depravity unconcealed 
Souls are left in a desolate place 
Forever rotting stagnant within the foul waste 
But their corruption is kept for it has work to do 
Prevaricating young minds so that they cannot see through 
The lies of society you're a puppet to perform 
While they laugh with pleasure as you try to conform 
Why Question why Doubt is your only friend 
I have such hatred for these creatures of lies 
Their simple actuality is enough for me to despise 
Am I right to judge their insignificance 
Yes So are you those without indifference 
For Satan's mind is vast among those who deceive 
And on those he feeds those who try to believe 
With their moral fairy tales and scriptures so frail 
To myself and to Satan you can hear my hail

Society and religion teach us to love one another 
To follow the frameworks 
That filled their empty lives  empty minds 
The pressure I feel 
Is fucking unreal 
Why can't they see my inability to love 
Why can't they open their eyes 
All they see is what they want to see 
They see their vision of me it's not me 
How can I love others when I can't love myself 
The pain I've felt has destroyed the love in me 
My frustration increases into a silent scream 
Where is the relief When can I be free 
I have tried to love but it can never be 
Hate is all I can ever feel 
To dwell on death is love for me 
They look through their rosecoloured glasses 
At the beauty of the world 
They're so blind and fucking ignorant 
That love's all they see 
Any sorrow they come across never cuts deep 
Because real pain is what ignorance can't feel 
It just runs shallow through their pretentious world 
Never looking into themselves 
They adopt the feelings of somebody else 
Never stopping to think who they are 
Or what life is 
They become what society expects them to be 
I stare back at these people who stare at me 
They laugh through their vanity so ignorant 
They can't begin to realise that my mind is free 
My hateful wisdom destroys them relieving my pain 
For their souls will be banished to forever live in ignorance 
Those who laugh at philosophies they know nothing of 
Are those who mostly disgust me 
And I shall be avenged through the power of Satan anarchy 
Satanism isn't fantasy it is based on the philosophies of life 
Comparable to man's basic instincts 
Now laugh if you please 
There is no such thing as nothing 
My curse is considered to be invoked with wrath
And I am striken with guilt in the aftermath
I might be the purest of heart
But by night I am the howling beast
Who can tear you apart
I am the beast
Who is not afraid of the priest
Neither the holy water
Nor the exorcist
Call me an insult to heaven or praise to hell
As the full moon whispers a spell
My soul and spirit start to rebel
Kill me before I shapeshift or get killed
As the claws of death call you out
You scream your last breath
I am the prayer for your sin
And I'll maul you to death
The curse invoked with wrath and guilt of the aftermath
Purest heart but by night growls and tears you apartWe'd like to take you to a place so far from here
A lesson in lost and shattered men
Welcome to the story of their solemn fears
Spare all the innocence you can
Here in this world of lost misery
A bit of faith isn't that what you said
Sometimes they face endless futility
All of them have lived on the edge
Here we standIt's a long way down
Lives in handCan you see the end
Ours to takeFind a reason
Ours to wasteBefore you make the call
All AloneIt's a long way home
Free to goAre you really free
Revenge is sweetSickeningly so
Best served coldWhat are you thinking
Are you saying that all you had means nothing
If that's your sight now then you will be here forever
The sting of hatred is all too real to you
A face in time is all you know
A world shut out unable to rescue you
A final plea begging for your soul
As you leave to carry out your final masquerade
It becomes so clear this darkness in your head
A pawn in the game of humanity
Another lost soul crying from the edge
Where is homeIt's a long way down
Where is meOn the edge of life
Reflections ofI'll take the time
Broken dreamsTo help you understand
Lost in timeIt's a long way home
No place hereIt's the life you lead
May be hopeI'll take the time
I don't careForgive yourself
If you're convinced that all in life means nothing
Then I can't help you you have reached the edge
Was like I walked inside your mind
A darkened place with no windows
Was like through you I saw me
A gaping hole inside
The words never come out right
We must leave this room take my hand and
Come fly away at last forever
All this can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
All you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here
And the shadows fading
The mysteries upon my wall
Are there any angels anywhere
I hear the cries all the time
Baptized by fire in the holy light
Come fly away at last forever
Heaven can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
And all you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here
We can be healed
And we can be sacrificed I know
I know
We can be healed
And we can be sacrificed I know
Come fly away at last forever
Heaven can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
Do I hear you laughing now
Is that a sword I see
This saga has an ending after all
Endless hallsIt's so hard to see the answers
Burning dreamsA life for me you are falling
Come fly away at last forever
All this can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
All you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here
Come fly away at last forever
All this can wait
All those times we appeared holding out our hands
All you'll know and all you'll see
Is wrapped within a mirror
See our souls all our fears far away from here
Forgive me Father for I am about to sin
My God
Smiling like a glad man
Frowning like a sad man
Feeling like a goddamn fool
It's a con game
And they say that God will forgive me
Amnesty for repenting here
How can he
Hello father Father please help me
Tell me that God will forgive me now
Listen closely
Forgive me father I have sinned
I did another preacher in at confession
What's the matter now
Mr Holier than thou
Self righteous fool
I'll show you religion
And justice
Was about 3 years ago
I had a daughter 12 years old
She was my life
My essence
Taught her to obey the cross
The Father Son and the Holy Ghost
And the Good Book
And your type
She became his virgin prize
Dead and raped and sacrificed
Behind closed doors
In darkened rooms
I'm so sick and tired
Hypocritical liars
You
So you speak for God here
What does he say now
Is he gonna help you
Will he forgiveme
Father I see you wanna know what lies behind this icy stare
Don't dig my head for remorse in this trust me it's not there
I'd rather talk about you and where you fit in this
And why you all act like God and all that pertains to it
You say that you speak in his name but how can you forgive
The rapists and the killers I don't believe God ever did
What I need to know here is why God only talks through you
I can assure you Mr Holy Man God talks to me too
Just not in a million dollar church with gold frames
He speaks to me any place to God it's all the same
Have you heard enough information
Hey father are you afraid of me
You should be
I've said all that I need to
Thank you for letting me speak my peace
It's a wonder
Get down on your knees
That's right you better plead it's the last time
You will pray
Tell me do do you forgive me
Tell me do do you still love me father
I need to know
Has my soul been sold
Is God here with you
Does he love me
Does he love me
Does he love me too
Confession's over
Is this what you are
Is this what you have become
Reflections of your demise
All the things
Made for kings
You'll find them here
Your people too
They'll bleed for you
You've made that clear
Look one time at your reflection
A broken looking glass what you've become
We all wonder what's in the conscience of the king
Does he think of the dead or the heroes gone
Has he a life does he think of everything
Is he hurt by the word does he rule on the edge
Placate the sinners
Vanity is all around you
Blood leaves stains for life
All the men
They can't defend
Your stratosphere
Suddenly
Out from the calm
You feel the fear
Another glance at your reflection
The looking glass will now look back at you
Sire do you know what it is to be alone
Can you ever be yourelf Is it hard to be
What is Heaven like What's it like to live your life
Is it everything it's all made out to be
Sovereign we're alive and we're here to save your life
Tell us what to do here your majesty
Should we weild the sword Should we fight for you my Lord
What's the matter paramount can't you speak
We all wonder what's in the conscience of the king
Does he ever think of us Does he hear our song
Regal do you know what it is to be alone
We will always pray for you in your kingdom on the edge
I walk alone endless seas of souls around me
His face it told of the mad existence a silent story
And just how they took him they tore a free soul down
Didn't leave a trace
And how he sat and faced it he didn't make a sound
And I watched in silence as
Tears fell like rain the world went insane around him
All those times I wondered where we were going then
Out here it never changed unlock these chains that bind me
Oh the world why is it so hard to understand
She looks out from high above the dark and cold streets
There in her room she waits in riches for something to happen
Money can't heal her the hole she feels inside
One step closer
Staring into God's eyes she says her last goodbye then jumps to the cure 
as
Tears fall like rain eyes filled with sadness I see
A world in struggle for its very soul
And the preachers they all pray looking for some salvation
I can't see how we made it through yesterday
And tears fall like rain those childlike hopes of being happy
Seem overshadowed by a distant cry
Salvation never came to those of us who saw the story
We must always close our eyes and look the other way
Passive pretense killing license witnesses sworn to silence
Was it meant to be this way
Losing falling satan calling threatening your one and only
Drowning in your own sorrow wasting away
All my fears they are coming
And this lonely life I'm condemned to live
It can be your home forever
Losing patience warring nations drug infested correlation
Is it the life you feel
Victim's silence caring violence doctor assisted suicide
And here you are sitting you're wasting away
All my fears they are calling
And this world upon my screen it will be my home forever
They speak again one last time he spoke the words
He said I'll be there just close your eyes remember always
Then there was a silence where the dream went here it was over then
Another love gone another heart to heal
Hold yours forever
And tears fall like rain worlds apart they sit and wonder
How things could get so wrong when they were fine
This world it seems insane all these dreams are left behind them
Does it matter where or why anyway
And it will be okay things will be all right tomorrow
Afterall we made it through yesterday
It's time again
Fate demands that I think again
About my life and how it feels to be all alone
And the wizard of my mind
Oracle of all that's mine
Comes from deep inside
In a closetsize world of golden stories
This is
This is my Imaginarium
This is
This is the heart that pumps the golden blood
Where to I don't know
This is
This is my Imaginarium
This is
This is the vent of hate pain and love
Stay awhile I don't know
Come in step inside my son
Do you see all that could have been
Do you fear what you see my friend
Do you have the heart to return again
Do you
Come in step inside my son
Can you imagine staring at unreality immortality
Breaking away from all that used to be
And it's not even a dream
Or like anything that I've ever seen
You just close your eyes and the world is in your mind
It's a scary place to be
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes
This is
This is my Imaginarium
This is
This is the place where all the dreamers come
Stay here I don't know
This is
This is my Imaginarium
This is
This is a world of death fear and love
Stay with me I don't know
This is
This is my Imaginarium
This is
This is the place where all can be one
This is
This is my Imaginarium
This is
This is the vent of hate pain and love
Come here I don't know
Come in step inside my son
Do you see all that could have been
Do you fear what you see my friend
Do you have the heart to return again
Do you
Come in step inside my son
I'm back again
And what I've seen and done
Brings me down when I realize where I've been
Now that I've lived my fantasy
Life is no longer good enough to me
It's a scary place to be
Imagine the scene of a world far away
And we are completely unobtrusive
A victim of a man with hope in his hands
Reaching for the stars
A feeling gone
Fate has another life to take
And here in a place of wonders
Never really all alone
Happy just to be a number
Somewhere in our world on the edge
It's like I've heard a thousand times before
By the ones who always chose to ignore me then
Play all the games and fear all the laws
That's what gives the people their meaning they said
And here in a lifeless wonder
Creating endless legacies
Everyone pull out their numbers
Wait in line on the back of the edge
I wake up every morning watch the news on TV
I'm numb to all the lies everyone believes
I do the same things other numbers do
I see the same old faces and
There you are again
Fate has another life to take
And fear has another soul to break
And here in my world of numbers
Embracing long gone memories
Waiting to be sucked under
Sitting silently on the edge
I've never been one much to complain
I looked into the mirror
And there I was again
Same old faces always seen before
Like a million stranded others I don't know him anymore
And here in the world of thunder
Striving only to believe
Remaining silent for no longer
Screaming from my mountain on the edge
Through rose colored lies
Calling you names from my social island
Why can't I be happy again
It's the way things are and I can't change them
It's the way
There is no cure
A lust we can't control
It's a rather sick position dont'cha think
In a talk that I had with a man who was mad
It was here it was there
Couldn't find it anywhere
It was up it was down
Squares rolling round and round
It was crowded it was lonely
A show written only for me
Had this sick and happy feeling
I was home again
It was old it was new
Too many and too few
It was numbing it was high
And I was laughing the whole time
It was cold it was warm
It was clear but I saw the storm
Had a clear distorted feeling
I'd be back again
Call me what you will
Satisfy yourself
Justify your position
Money
It's a problem
It's so much more
I can suppress this hole if I try
It's the way
There is no cure
It's a lust we can't control
It's a rather sick position dont'cha think
In a nightmare that I had with a sick demented man
Had no fear and no love
No faith in God above
It was truth it was lies
The searing burning kind
It was random it was fate
Too soon and too late
Had this wild mixed up feeling
I was back again
It was death it was life
A victim's last rights
It was playful it was hurtful
And I loved it the whole time
It was there in my head
A lusting for the dead
Had this sick and happy feeling
I was home again
This is the slow part
Where the man always finds his way
A sad reflection a resolution
So safe where you are listening in your own surroundings
Where are you now do you have me on while your driving
Maybe your at home perhaps in position compromising
Then there's the five bastards
Playing this song right now
Cashing in on my plight
And who the fuck are they
Do hey have the nightmares you and I do
All right it's okay let them whore me they'll get their due
And how 'bout you You bought this song now just listen
No matter what you think of me
I'm the soul who'll be behind you one day
Tearing your life into little pieces
Hey I'm jealous of you
I can say that now but there's so much more to tell
I have the resolution the quick solution to your problem
It's a rather sick position dont'cha think
And the love that I have with this crazy sick old friend
It was dark it was bright
A cold and stormy night
It was real it wasn't there
I couldn't help but stare
It had started it was over
Looking over shoulders
Had intense and lonely feelings
I was home again
It was here it was there
Couldn't find it anywhere
It was up it was down
Squares rolling round and round
It was crowded it was lonely
A play written only for me
Had this sick and happy feeling
I was home again
If you'd like to make a call please hang up and try again
If you need help hang up and then dial your operator
Those times
When there was something inside
Something to fight for
Something in you
But I don't care
Anymore
I've wasted too much time already
I can't take anymore of your manipulation
I can feel my patience breaking
You wanted me to come down with you
Well here I am
You said somewhere that I oughta know
And you weren't gonna let me forget the pain I left you in
I can see your promise breaking
Isn't it ironic
You oughta know
There isn't anything left in me
That your sick repulsive ways haven't taken away
Stop your suicidal faking
Oh you're so persecuted
You oughta know
You oughta know
You oughta know
What have the prophets done to gain the path we seek
The grayness that I see above it always follows me
And the fruits of this life they take on many forms
As the fire in Hell's cauldron the image it always burns
And the books
See the pages
Read between the lines
It's been shadowed with disillusionment
Just take back what you find
Let's hide away to the distant hills never question why
When we were conceived to this we were baptized by fire
No it's a lie and it's not mine
It's a tragedy a mystery
That we must find
It's a call to war
It's a shameless whore
It's a fantasy a mystery
It's all you wanted here
I know that I can be sure of a quiet walk with you
Scenes of distance and sounds of calming my hideaway is you
Dreams are slower the day is longer and I can face it too
Take me hold me no one can hurt me all because of you
Sold it's a fake
It's a give and take
It's a mystery infinity
It's a world too late
It's a kind of fear
And it's all right here
Don't know the way I feel today
Though it feels I'm way ahead this time
Seems far too good to be true
I know
I know
I know that there is a savior when the day is through
A passive knowing a faithful wanting a world I know as you
And fate is a walk I fear to take it's true
I know
I sometimes feel I'll never make it through
I know
I know
Like a child born to survive all basking time with you
Spending hours on ivory towers could this all be true
Hate it's a fire
It's a bold faced lie
It's a fallacy insanity
The disease inside
It's a walk through tears
For all those years
It's misery your history
And it's all right here
The end it's a race
In the life you faced
It's a parody hypocrisy
It's your one last taste
And death for real
Yeah it makes no deals
It's a tragedy reality
No one wants to hear
I know that I can be sure of quiet nights with you
A face of knowing and understanding one I know as you
In the distance I see existence I know you see it too
You're all I dream of you're all I think of I know I just love you
No it's gone
Life's not that long
It's senility a rhapsody
It's all that's wrong
And here you stand
All alone again
It's misery insanity
You can't defend
And now you're dead
It's a kick in the head
It's a tragedy a mystery
Isn't that what you said
But if you can take the bounty
I will grab the soul
Then we'll run away together
no one will ever know
Hello Lord I'm here again
It's like I feared and then some more
It's gone away
Cradle the calm and calm the weary
I must put this all behind me
It's like you said before
Here in silent dreams
Understand the way I see it
It seems like the world can't feel it
I know they don't need to Lord
No one takes pity on what they don't know
Here in a world of fate
The answers they come too late for me
The fire streaks the bloodstained sky
Drain the oceans and turn out the sun
Silence the laughter I have no need for them
Anymore
It's all been a dream from this day on
Holding the torch and torching the theory
Reaching for something to save me
Nothing I have known can save my soul tonight
I find that I'm all alone
Same as I've ever known
A voice from the edge screaming something
Something from a fantasy
Screaming the final plea
The echoes they remain
We'd like to take you to a place so far from here
A world of lost and shattered men
We've seen the world through their solemn fears
Spare all the pity that you can
Because we all walk on the edge at times
Holding on for our very lives
Only the ones who ever risk are truly free
Only the ones who risk ever fly
Now we seeIt's a long way down
We believeIs there an end
Ours to stayFind a reason
Ours to leaveBefore you turn away
All aloneIt's a long way home
Free to goI'm really free
Time to seeI can see the end
Time to knowI can make it through
Where am I
Have I really made it here
You have reached the
You have reached the
You have reached the
You have reached
The EdgeLaying silent in the shade
Search the sky for stars
I have counted them all
Silent
Laying silent in a glade
Picture dreams of clouds afar
Serene now my call
An escape from this truth
An escape from this earth
Leave me be
I cherish a dream
Travel beyond what I imagine
I know it could be real
To find the key that make this happen
An escape into the serene
Silent
Laying silent in the shade
Weave fantasy to reality
A save abide I will find
Silent
Laying silent in a glade
And haunt the bitterness which lives in me
Serene is my mind
The eclipse of the sun
Throws a shadow on this planet
Cold winds rushing over land
Frost is reigning
All warmth is vanished
Winter
No romantic nights
Stare at the blue cold moon
Feel the earth becomes colder
Brain it's slowly freezing it slowly dies
Nature a mass of ice
No romantic nights
Stare at the blue cold moon
Feel the earth becomes colder
Brain it's slowly freezing it slowly dies
Nature a mass of ice
Frost I'm yours
Winter forever
When I see a glimpse of the dark
My deepest desire will carry it's mark
Concentrate the attractive face staring stark
Subconscious stretches in opaque it parks
In sublime place I'll stay
Benevolence of the opaque
Nothing in my way
Benevolence of the opaque
Soul pass out
Exultant shout
Away
Float away all doubts
I weep my mind in ecstacy
Ejaculation dark I come to thee
When I see a glimpse of the dark
My deepest desire will carry it's mark
Concentrate the attractive face staring stark
Subconscious stretches in opaque it parks
In sublime place I stay
Benevolence of the opaque
Nothing in my way
Benevolence of the opaque
Chased thru love
The warmth it gives can't reach me
Live in isolation
The cold inside mesmerizing me
Prayers denied
Makes the end complete
Restless wrestling
Allow me my sleep
The last try to enter my loneliness
Passing me by this tender touch of loveliness
Chased thru love
The warmth it gives can't reach me
Live in isolation
The cold inside mesmerizing me
Prayers denied
Makes the end complete
Restless wrestling
Allow me my sleep
Creep into the black void
Life I ignore I don't talk anymore
I can't take anymore
I have no more wings
I can't take anymore
The gates of heaven sealed
Don't you hear me
Don't you hear me
Don't you fear me
Of never coming back
Do you know what it's like
When heaven's hung in black
I can't take anymore
The walls are black and bleed
I can't take anymore
No rooms here for your screams
Don't you hear me
Don't you hear me
Don't you fear me
Of never coming back
Oh no more tears please
Hanging heaven black
Don't you leave me to die
And you'll know what it's like
The weary wall of sighs
Heaven's hung in black
And you'll know what it's like
When paradise is blind
Where are your graves
You cannot hear a bird's song
Innocent lives witnesses of disaster
Forgotten names what have become of them
In wild river never can they awake
Penetrating flames they're calling to myself
God sees it from afar but leaves it till the end
If I could drive away these clouds by my strong breath
You wouldn't have to wait for salvation and empty future
I knew the gorgeous woods and valleys
Scents of flowers and trees
Now you are living in Lakeland and dying days
The sun means day and night for us is resurrection
Wings of years don't save our weakness
The bells of churches our joy our care
The room is darkened I can't hear the voice
The dream is alive and I see you all of us again
I crossed the dark and I see the past here am I
Maybe I'll breathe maybe I'll stay with you or
Beyond the gate
We're smiling and crying your name sounds in our ears
I don't believe I'm on the way between the death and eternity
And I'd like to wake in your kingdom on one day
We're just puppets you haven't changes us we're
Afraid in your arms
The night has come and tender streetlights
Enlight snowy church
Thousand days ago you had the same thoughts
You are feel lost without family sinful and lonely
Clutch cold handle of majestic doors
That's time for the shadows of your life
Eyes of the angels see the tears in our palms
You're a young man with face of old man
With scarred body and soul
The nights are long getting longer
States of depression and thoughts of suicide
Couple of perverted moments and years
The love was called drug
States of depression
Impious and sinful life ravens nation is born
We hold the cross of thorns in palms of blood
Chorales sounds through the valley
Celebration of the earthly life and lustful
Bodies of beauties mean sin
Beings clad in the darkness from god's will chosen
Coming to the village with finite resolution
Accusation and deceit holy will orders revenge
Envoys of fornication driven away in wagons
Stoupa jen dym a jak zalostny je plac vsech lidi
Kolem a z nebes cerna zar
Pod krizem spi vzdy jen proroctvi a splin a tisice
Tvari uz zmenili jste v dym
Zkousite Ihat sami sobe v motlitbach a hrisnikum
Svym smrt vykoupenim dat
Zapalena je uz hranice vsech tel
Jak zakon vam kaze vse spalit na popel
My life I loved you so but can't dream about
A neverending sacred night
Honesty was not my oath in the fields of love I heard
The weeping of her glowing eyes
My time has come and I pray for all my life sins
Maybe I will confess to god but without tears
I'm daze by the light of the eternal way
Behind the gate of times
Echoes of calls pray for my return
Calls of known voices
But she didn't stay with me behind the gate
I know she didn't stay with me my only love
She's living her short story leading for the crime
She's speaking to mirror of river
Her inner fight and war against others
She pervaded into the postmortem scenery through mist
So far from valley of morass from cry of the village bells
Her soul is not confused Maybe mind premonition
Labeled a madwoman she seeks from people
Horrify children voices girl with scars of decease
She rises her fiery torch in the middle
Of the night in the moonlight
Slowly walking to her revenge burning homes of enemies
Lamentations in the wind humans forever lost
She's fighting for love and against hate of others
After everything's burnt will she feel the mercy and grief
For father an mothers hanged for profane lies for her destiny
When she defended her soul in darkness
Without the love of god with her god or farewell
In an empty house where I had seen your face
Eternal silence came you disappeared without trace
Behind the empty house smell of arms like a witness
One cruelty is over hatred breed fear
Maybe you disappeared
If loving means losing then love in the afterlife
Light and dark we always fumble at the bottom of conscience
Slave and time all stories of horror go repeatingof violence
Light and dark why do I keep the seeing wraith of your soul
Slave and time all stories of horror go repeatingof violence
Stay alive another sunset No time to cry I must tell you
Oh how I would die for you Stay alive another dawn
In the meadow full of flowers and scared with crosses
Please wait for me
We want to be honest and satisfied till the end of our days
Millions eyes so often are blind it's agony of mankind
The hate is born the hate arose from perfidious love
The wicked people rule over this world and children's cry
In the anthem of mankind
We know the prophecy of our ancestors of the truth
Turning into the light
He who promises true love and peace then sells the war and fear
The hate is born the hate arose from perfidious love
We live together in poverty and wealth
We destroy hearts loving their own lives
You may hope to see wake up the sun
Joy and happiness strangers to your minds
Your only certitude in this damned world is
The innocence is lost
The songs of your fatherlands undesired pride
Tons of live arms are the flags of fire
You lost all brothers so suddenly
This cruel damned world we still cherish
Just silent memory sounds in my head
So many ways to destroy mankind
We have chosen the shortest way ever known
Do I hear the song of freedom
Gekas na svou chvili propadls falesnemu chtici
Je to noc zklamanych dusi neni nic co te znici
Tise spi zivotem vonici telo mlady dcery tvy
Odsouzena na tvoje hrichy na dlouhy minuty sileny
Studena samota prochazi telem tvym telem tvym
Vzdyt sis to pral
Tvoje city dabel hlida je bezmocna chces jeji telo jeji dech
Pral sis horet v jejim tele studenym
Hazdy odpor znicit I kdyz nechce  musis to mit
V mori slanych slz se pritom utapi
Detsky hlas detsky plac detsky splin
Pral sis horet v jejim tele studenym
Kazdy odpor znicit I kdyz nechce  musis to mit
V mori slanych slz se pritom utapi
Detsky hlas detsky plac detsky splin
Proklina te a silnej rev je tak znicena
Posila te do pekel kde misto mas
S nozem ted ses posel smrti chces videt krev
Je to noc zklamanych dusi neni nic co te znici
Zatmeni v lebce branis svuj chtic
Slaba se trese mlatis ji vic
Nervy ti praskly uz ztraci zvuj dech
Jses jako zvire chces posledni vydech
Proc ses tu dal skyz ztuhla uz je
Navzdy uz spi smutek nasleduje
Prazdny dum kde si zustal sam a jenom telo dcery tvy
Tu spi zdeseni kdyz vidis z jeji hlavy kapat krev
Ted vis ze je bliz a bliz den sdy tu svou pout zakoncis
Ghtel si horet v jejim tele studenym
V sobe tolik chlastu stal ses katem silenym
Vecne ticho v zilach samotu rozleva
Zradnej chtic zase prekonal tvoje ja
Ghtel si horet v jejim tele studenym
Kdyz prislo mlhavy rano doufals ze jenom snis
Tak si shorel v jejim tele studenym
A prisel cas kdys musel jit za ni
Odejit navzdy jit za niWhere are your graves
You cannot hear a bird's song
Innocent lives witnesses of disaster
Forgotten names what have become of them
In wild river never can they awake
Penetrating flames they're calling to myself
God sees it from afar but leaves it till the end
If I could drive away these clouds by my strong breath
You wouldn't have to wait for salvation and empty future
I knew the gorgeous woods and valleys
Scents of flowers and trees
Now you are living in Lakeland and dying days
The sun means day and night for us is resurrection
Wings of years don't save our weakness
The bells of churches our joy our care
The room is darkened I can't hear the voice
The dream is alive and I see you all of us again
I crossed the dark and I see the past here am I
Maybe I'll breathe maybe I'll stay with you or
Beyond the gate
We're smiling and crying your name sounds in our ears
I don't believe I'm on the way between the death and eternity
And I'd like to wake in your kingdom on one day
We're just puppets you haven't changes us we're
Afraid in your arms
The night has come and tender streetlights
Enlight snowy church
Thousand days ago you had the same thoughts
You are feel lost without family sinful and lonely
Clutch cold handle of majestic doors
That's time for the shadows of your life
Eyes of the angels see the tears in our palms
You're a young man with face of old man
With scarred body and soul
The nights are long getting longer
States of depression and thoughts of suicide
Couple of perverted moments and years
The love was called drug
States of depression
Impious and sinful life ravens nation is born
We hold the cross of thorns in palms of blood
Chorales sounds through the valley
Celebration of the earthly life and lustful
Bodies of beauties mean sin
Beings clad in the darkness from god's will chosen
Coming to the village with finite resolution
Accusation and deceit holy will orders revenge
Envoys of fornication driven away in wagons
Stoupa jen dym a jak zalostny je plac vsech lidi
Kolem a z nebes cerna zar
Pod krizem spi vzdy jen proroctvi a splin a tisice
Tvari uz zmenili jste v dym
Zkousite Ihat sami sobe v motlitbach a hrisnikum
Svym smrt vykoupenim dat
Zapalena je uz hranice vsech tel
Jak zakon vam kaze vse spalit na popel
My life I loved you so but can't dream about
A neverending sacred night
Honesty was not my oath in the fields of love I heard
The weeping of her glowing eyes
My time has come and I pray for all my life sins
Maybe I will confess to god but without tears
I'm daze by the light of the eternal way
Behind the gate of times
Echoes of calls pray for my return
Calls of known voices
But she didn't stay with me behind the gate
I know she didn't stay with me my only love
She's living her short story leading for the crime
She's speaking to mirror of river
Her inner fight and war against others
She pervaded into the postmortem scenery through mist
So far from valley of morass from cry of the village bells
Her soul is not confused Maybe mind premonition
Labeled a madwoman she seeks from people
Horrify children voices girl with scars of decease
She rises her fiery torch in the middle
Of the night in the moonlight
Slowly walking to her revenge burning homes of enemies
Lamentations in the wind humans forever lost
She's fighting for love and against hate of others
After everything's burnt will she feel the mercy and grief
For father an mothers hanged for profane lies for her destiny
When she defended her soul in darkness
Without the love of god with her god or farewell
In an empty house where I had seen your face
Eternal silence came you disappeared without trace
Behind the empty house smell of arms like a witness
One cruelty is over hatred breed fear
Maybe you disappeared
If loving means losing then love in the afterlife
Light and dark we always fumble at the bottom of conscience
Slave and time all stories of horror go repeatingof violence
Light and dark why do I keep the seeing wraith of your soul
Slave and time all stories of horror go repeatingof violence
Stay alive another sunset No time to cry I must tell you
Oh how I would die for you Stay alive another dawn
In the meadow full of flowers and scared with crosses
Please wait for me
We want to be honest and satisfied till the end of our days
Millions eyes so often are blind it's agony of mankind
The hate is born the hate arose from perfidious love
The wicked people rule over this world and children's cry
In the anthem of mankind
We know the prophecy of our ancestors of the truth
Turning into the light
He who promises true love and peace then sells the war and fear
The hate is born the hate arose from perfidious love
We live together in poverty and wealth
We destroy hearts loving their own lives
You may hope to see wake up the sun
Joy and happiness strangers to your minds
Your only certitude in this damned world is
The innocence is lost
The songs of your fatherlands undesired pride
Tons of live arms are the flags of fire
You lost all brothers so suddenly
This cruel damned world we still cherish
Just silent memory sounds in my head
So many ways to destroy mankind
We have chosen the shortest way ever known
Do I hear the song of freedom
Gekas na svou chvili propadls falesnemu chtici
Je to noc zklamanych dusi neni nic co te znici
Tise spi zivotem vonici telo mlady dcery tvy
Odsouzena na tvoje hrichy na dlouhy minuty sileny
Studena samota prochazi telem tvym telem tvym
Vzdyt sis to pral
Tvoje city dabel hlida je bezmocna chces jeji telo jeji dech
Pral sis horet v jejim tele studenym
Hazdy odpor znicit I kdyz nechce  musis to mit
V mori slanych slz se pritom utapi
Detsky hlas detsky plac detsky splin
Pral sis horet v jejim tele studenym
Kazdy odpor znicit I kdyz nechce  musis to mit
V mori slanych slz se pritom utapi
Detsky hlas detsky plac detsky splin
Proklina te a silnej rev je tak znicena
Posila te do pekel kde misto mas
S nozem ted ses posel smrti chces videt krev
Je to noc zklamanych dusi neni nic co te znici
Zatmeni v lebce branis svuj chtic
Slaba se trese mlatis ji vic
Nervy ti praskly uz ztraci zvuj dech
Jses jako zvire chces posledni vydech
Proc ses tu dal skyz ztuhla uz je
Navzdy uz spi smutek nasleduje
Prazdny dum kde si zustal sam a jenom telo dcery tvy
Tu spi zdeseni kdyz vidis z jeji hlavy kapat krev
Ted vis ze je bliz a bliz den sdy tu svou pout zakoncis
Ghtel si horet v jejim tele studenym
V sobe tolik chlastu stal ses katem silenym
Vecne ticho v zilach samotu rozleva
Zradnej chtic zase prekonal tvoje ja
Ghtel si horet v jejim tele studenym
Kdyz prislo mlhavy rano doufals ze jenom snis
Tak si shorel v jejim tele studenym
A prisel cas kdys musel jit za ni
Odejit navzdy jit za niA frozen Galaxy drifted
in Nature's amniotic seas
a universe of starry majesty
in the vast ocean of Space
Black planets rolled
without lustre and aim
in the yawning dark Void
It was the dawn of times
the dawn of Genesis
the age of mystery
Motionless stars
without name  knowledge
a cosmic empire
in the stifling black fluid
The world waited its own birth
in an icy uninvaded sleep
And the Great Omnipotent slumbered
on the verge of the deep
A cosmic empire
a slumbering galaxy
A cosmic empire
in the cradle of eternity
The selfbegotten deity
The steadfast Earth shuddered
roaring fires ran over heavens
in tears  howling embodied
a female form Mother of all beings
Like a faint shadow she rose from the ground
trembling  pale like a newborn child
beneath her feet a vast unprolific ground
above her head the indefinite space
For ages she wandered in the forsaken wilderness
searching for lifeforms
She found nothing but a dire emptiness
a soulshuddering Vacuum
Whirlwinds of sulphurous smoke
torrents of lava vapour  clouds
terrible thunders tore the mantle of Earth
unquenchable fires consumed the ground
Her lamenting voice wept upon the void
but there were no one to hear her
She was alone in a world of inertia
divided by tears  sorrows 
From the vast deluge of her tears
an unfathomable ocean rose
An ocean teemed with strange organism
and creatures bred in sorrow
Various forms of being crawled out from the sea
and mustard around the great Mother
And she rejoiced beholding her daughters  sons
and gave them the Earth  the Skies to conquer
Once under starry heavens
a garden was planted
a wondrous work in the waste wilderness
where lions walked in humility
Once the Sons Of Eternal Joy reigned upon the Earth
and angelic myriad ruled the skies
In his celestial abode the Old One slumbered
the one who formed the world into existence
It was a golden age 
era of beauty  joy
Death was not nor iniquity
the fountain of eternal life sprung
The Infernal Serpent laid on the verge of nonentity
a doleful shade before the immense gates of Infinity
Once man walked the heavenly path
in sweet ignorance
enchanted by the unearthly beauty of Eden
in ecstatic joy
Once the Daughters Of Light danced
in that realm of mild moony lustre
In whirlwinds of tempestuous fires
a phantasm rose upon heavens
a fearful Eidolon
Lucifer was his name in Eternity
the Father of Pestilence
Monarch of the Sulphurous Empire
Arch Enemy of Heavens
Wanton enormity 
from the flames of eternal fury
delighting in blood
armed with destruction  plagues
The Black Angel stood at the centre of all infinity
with ambitious aim against the Monarchy of God 
Loathsome in a serpentlike form
he descended into the blissful garden
a guileful reptile a King of Tyre
Master of Temptation
A bittersweet taste of that Forbidden Fruit
Entice of Evil a Serpent in every bosom
We lay naked in the wind in shame  fear
exiled into a solitary night rent from Eternity
o Times Remote Blissful Ignorance
Would a Forgiving Father
take such a vengeance
upon his beloved children
Did Jesus weep for us
No I don't think so
we're the sinbred offsprings of Judas
The One who sits high on the sky
on an empyreal throne
is not our Father
Was it just a dream
The God upon his mercy seat 
Was it just an illusion
Our Divine Abode
A Hell for each Vice
for every Disobedience
Alone in the Great Wilderness
in a night of vast durance
Terrible spires  monoliths
under unvanquished skies
A vast ivoryblack tower
in Night's hellishblack mire
A brooding dark power
a spreading black world
Some said It's Babylon
the abominable realm of Man
Standing tall like a steadfast giant
eclipsing the stars usurping heavens
a phantom world in the sickening light
a vast monument of perverseness
Now We worship Satan the Bringer Of Light
Oh you Selfish Father you left us on that horrid night
We forgot Eden the Garden of Joy
our eternal life like a dream dissolved
O God of Almighty Heavens
who will save us from perdition
Shall our immortal vigour return
or shall we drown with the Stygian floodMy goddess you who haunts my nights
Why don't you come to meet me 
Reign and power for eternity
Come my beauty together as one
We shall defeat the world
I fall your coldness going through me
But your presence restoring my strength
I can't see you but I know you're here
Show me the way so that I can finally deliver you
It takes so long that I wait for this moment
I've crossed centuries alone always alone
Now I'm so tired 
I've explored all these worlds looking for you
Never finding you
I'm giving up my heart is dying
In this frozen night
A storm is rising
And death is coming to find me
With dignity and without bitterness
I went away with her
I've crossed so many realms
Except the one of the dead of Death
Finally there you are Goddess of my dreams
Goddess of my nights
Death has brought us together
I'll never leave you alone now 
During our body's sleep
Our mind is linked with strangeness
Which reveals none of its secrets none of its pleasure
It certainly doesn't wish it
In order not to bother everybody's conscience
And not to turn lives upside down forever
The awakening of supernatural is done every night
At anytime Morpheus fondles your face
We are interested in the discovery of new beings of new gods
Just after our takeoff everything seems so simple
The heaviness of our wings doesn't disturb us anymore
The only pleasure the mortals don't know
Reach us at the right moment
Just to forget our painful past
Strangeness reveals us none of its secrets
None of its pleasure
It certainly doesn't wish it
In order not to bother anyone's conscience
Because one doubt one fear and insanity could prevail
After all these days
Watching our love grow
Wishing too much to believe in it
I've lost all hope 
And you still don't understand 
My feelings were not really bad
And gradually my fears go away 
But my disillusion was huge
I who believed in you
Now I stay lonely
Alone facing myself 
Like at the end of a dream
Followed by a painful awakening
In an unchanging reality 
Everything in me becomes violence
I want to scream my pain
To release all this hatred
Wish is heading towards you
But all is just patience 
And one day my time will come
My words will hurt you 
But that's the price I demand 
To share my pain with you 
So that you can see in my heart
All this sadness that is mine 
And I will let you dive
Dive in your depression
Until death takes you away 
Repeat  Everything in me 
Repeat  After all these days 
Pierce my heart so that I can live immortality
Take my body forever in your arms
Don't forget it among the unfaithful beings
Take my soul in your incessant wind
And let's go away when it's still time
I've only lived once on this earth
The one where I saw your reign appears
But my living was short too short 
I've imagined this wind disturbing me one more time
Its smoothness and its coldness deluded me
My last breath before eternal rest
And the wind turned into a storm
My body could not resist
Its attraction was too strong
It took me away
I've found myself beside it
Floating above the continents
I cross the lands without laws without boundaries
I glide wherever I feel like
Nothing or even nobody can stop me
I'm the incessant wind
Which fondles your faces and steals your thoughts
Fear me
Or death will take you away
Repeat And the wind turned into a storm
Suddenly the sky darkens
The sun doesn't shine anymore
The clouds blacken the horizon
The world stops turning 
The night has invaded everything 
Then chaos 
Then this chaos that ends by reigning
All this violence
All this hatred
Men are fed by disgusting images 
TV is showing us
Human stupidity through reality show 
Moving into the 21st century to see that 
Wars have not stopped yet 
Tortures have not been forgotten yet 
And religion is still causing a lot of victims 
And I cannot do anything
What a sadness towards so much desolation 
What are we leaving behind us 
What kind of legacy for the next generations 
The future seems so dark to me 
Apocalypse is nearing
I go a little bit too fast
But by seeing the outside events
It seems that I have not much time 
Solitude is invading me 
And for me also night is lingering forever
Repeat  This chaos that ends by reigning I saw you walking round the house tonight
Trying to catch a glimpse of what's inside
Driven by some mix of curiosity
And a bit of nostalgia
This advice you should take seriously
What you seek is not in here
So don't come knocking at my door
For you should know that no one lives here
No more
A glass of wine stands on the table still
And flowers grace the window sill
You see a dim light shining from the fireplace
I notice you stare freezing cold
This advice you should
In this house
No one lives here
No more
A love unbreakable until it broke
A dream so real until I awoke
So what you see inside this house tonight
Is the mess you left behind
This advice you should
In this house
No one lives here
No more
Don't come here don't cross my way
Stay out of sight I don't want to see your face
Don't come here don't you hear what I say
Leave me alone I don't want your cold embrace
What you've done to me in the name of love
Wasn't quite what I had been thinking of
My wounded flesh lies open to your scorn
Each and every time we meet
And still it bleeds
Some experiences in life leave us with wounds
that keep bleeding even many years after the injury
They say that time heals all the wounds
but noone knows how much time will be necessary
Try to take my breath away
As long as I'm still breathing
Try to take my breath away
As long as you still can
Try to make me burn for you
Boil my blood until it's screaming
Try to make me burn for you
As long as you still can
Only tonight I'll be yours
When the morning breaks I will be gone for sure
I won't wait for you to leave me
So I will leave you instead
Never again love will kill me
Because I am already dead
Try to feel this heart of mine
As long as it's still beating
Try to feel this heart of mine
As long as you still can
Try to taste this blood of mine
As long as I'm still bleeding
Try to taste this blood of mine
As long as you still can
Only tonight I'll be yours
If I had if I only had
A heart to give I'd surely give it to you
If I had if I only had
A heart to give then I would gladly
I'd gladly make it yours
Only tonight I'll be yours
I had a dream of you tonight
I've been dreaming of a life we'd share
But when my hand reached out for you
I noticed there was no one there
Will you ever show up
Will you ever come here
And if you do please give me a sign
To make sure I notice it's you
And not just anyone again
Before sunrise I woke up
I got up early on my feet
Knocked at the door of every house
Called out for you in every street
Will you ever show up
I have never seen your face
I don't even know your name
So right now all that I can do
While I sit and wait
Is painting pictures
Pictures of you
Here in this night
In the darkest of hours
I feel a cold wind that tells
Of a storm front drawing near
It speaks of greed and of hunger
Of envy and dread
Tells of the anger and hate
That arose from the fear
Who said life's easy
Who said life's fair
Who said good luck will be with those who dare
To follow their heart and not follow their fear
And if the good all die young
Then who are all those still here
Take a look around you
See what you've got
You just see what you don't have
And of that you still have a lot
The sky is the limit
The sky's not enough
The tough keep going
Not only when the going gets rough
It seems we all
Don't worry much
About what is happening
Left and right of us
But even if I try my hardest
Not to care
One question remains
And I'd like to hear your answer
Acting on target
At robotic speed
Recklessly feeding
Your robotic needs
No minute wasted
Emotions refused
Your brain's exploited
Your heart remains unused
It seems we all
Name your price
How much is it to buy your loyalty
I'll do so if I can afford
Name your price
How much do you charge to show remorse
To throw your indifference overboard
Won't you once
Think just a little while about
What you will leave behind
When you decease
Won't you once
Just once be good for something
Good for someone
Good for yourself at least
Here in this night
In the darkest of hours
I feel a cold wind that tells
Of a storm front drawing near
It speaks of greed and of hunger
Of envy and dread
Tells of the anger and hate
That arose from the fear
Who said life's easy
And who said life's fair
Who said good luck will be with those who dare
To follow their heart not their fear
And if it's hope that dies last
Why do all us hopeless still live
Brother kills sister
Father kills son
Religion kills reason
Reason becomes undone
The end always
Justifies the means
Just running a program
Rooted deeply in our genes
It seems we all
Name your price
I have no faith
In a God above
But if I had
Then this would be my prayer
Oh Seven Seas
Raise all your waves
And take this Flesh back home
If you feel that you once loved
Too much to ever love again
Don't think nobody else
Feels the same or understands
Half my life I've been waiting just like you
Half the world I've travelled all in vain
Half my life I've been searching just like you
To find that link gone missing from the chain
In a thousand miles of crashing waves
Just once one might kiss the shore
And so does love take its time
But is still worth waiting for
Half my life
So what you're really trying to say
Is you don't want me to stand in your way
Is that all that you feel right now
My Dear I wish that you would understand
Sometimes things just go out of hand
And some things just happen somehow
For a shred of hope you would follow the devil
For a sense of bliss you would sell all of your dreams
For a trace of love we may lose mind completely
And there is not a lot that we can do
Is there nothing that we could do
Are we caught up in that river's flow
And for every new way that we go
Do we have to leave something behind
My Dear it's that river that gives and that takes
So for every new turn that it makes
We lose one thing but another we find
For a shred of hope
How many times did I wish I could just end this pain
That I could go back in time
To where it began and then start again
Well if we could so it would be so easy to make amends
But the river doesn't stand still
And the river just gives no second chance
Is there nothing that we could do
I don't love you and you don't love me
But with no one else right now I'd rather be
For since the day when we first met it seems that
When it rains I only get half as wet
We don't meet much we rather talk on the phone
But you make me feel only half as alone
You're not the girl of my dreams though I may dream of you
Don't really know what it is but this much is true
You're a shade of grey when my world turns blue
In a world of lies you are at least half way true
You don't love me well but you kind of like me instead
That's good enough to make me feel only half as bad
Of all second choices you'd be my first
Of all those bad solutions you are not the worst
Amongst these ugly faces yours looks kind of cute
And you have a way to lighten my mood
We haven't got much in common but that's one thing we share
And we won't call it love when it's just an affair
So while we are both waiting for the right one to come
We may as well wait together until we find the one
You're a shade of grey
Thanks for making me feel only half as bad
She found a withered flower
Between the pages of a book
This book's her book of memories
Which off the shelf she took
Tonight without a reason
Except for feeling in the mood
For a little journey backward
To give her weary soul some food
Some memories prick her like thorns
Some really make her smile
But she can't stop holding that flower
That speaks of a life that once was hers
Out of reach out of touch
But right now back in sight
She wishes she knew how to get back there
With her eyes closed she lets her
Memories take her on a ride
She relives all she has been through
And all she's put aside
It seems she had been walking
Down a long and rocky road
Sometimes she has been mourning
Her head she never bowed
Out of reach out of touch
But right now back in sight
She wishes she'd know how to get back there
Out of reach out of touch
But right now back in sight
She misses him badly and still she caresall ways lead to the queen what cards she still holds she plays like a 
hangman her house is full of the broken hearted a suicide king and a pair of 
rusted spades she is gone a bit mad she wants her roses painted red but 
we've yet to find the shade God save the queen she wears her suit on her 
sleeve her hourglass shape is a funhouse reflection heartbreaker don't let 
her find you here confidence is the cancer of this courtyard it'll split 
your head if we don't get to the flowers red death by division don't call it 
jealousy it's an exercise in infection control insanity's masterpiece split 
at the seams shakespearean virgin your world is a stage but your charms in 
the basket they gave the ax to an amateur I haven't stopped laughing how am 
I supposed to line this up kneel down vanity everyone's waiting we all want 
what's swollen depressurized look at the floor look at what you've done 
narcissus your reflection is heartbroken red your savior wears a charcoal 
veil these are the colors of her courtyard these are the suits that split 
the days two handed engine runs itself through the bone when the ego lands 
it rolls heads will roll
eyes of celibates burning images worn down rotted lies lips dried peeling 
eyes separate our lives dead underneath your skin this blood's not mine you 
fucking whore you don't deserve my Gods you're a deified angel you leave me 
sickened in prayer it's the residing disease in me that sheds it's halos for 
whores it leaves my wrists cut with jaded tongues your eyes freeze my fire 
of innocence whores addictions souls salvation I said it I'm so tired so 
saddened I'm no coward please bury me they broke my wings in an attempt to 
divide a sickness from comfort of open wounds wide eyed I died
strung by vein to running mouth your whispers are the catalyst somebody 
please breath lies my blood's not thick enough I can't hear my heart beat 
when you shut up still waiting for last rites still waiting on a goodbye 
kiss to sever the dead flesh and walk away a part of you please don't tell 
me you're useless with threaded lip my hands went numb to feel like you I 
should have known you were no angel by the way you said my name I'm running 
out of perfect moments I've grown tired of clothing the blood to whom it may 
concern you'll never keep my scars from healing you'll never leave my 
bridges burning consciousness comes and goes like the routine of three lost 
words lovers lay dead and when you're bound and gagged I defy you to define 
me it's the only way to feel like I'm still breathing I long for fresh air 
cleansed of sedition the waters listen closer that I tell them everything 
then take a deep breath
sign my farewell with the chimes of clock radios 7am sun reveals a failed 
cherubim dangling from the rafters like a sentimental ghost floating midway 
between the curse of the sky and you this noose carries what atrophied wings 
can't don't you want me disenchanted a deader shade of sorry buried from the 
neck up in a slipknot dragging my feet through the dead air suspended a 
fallen chair length from the ground when you found me when they finally 
found me this halo fit my throat I am your contorted angel writhing at a 
loss for wings swelled tongues tell of brighter eyes a severed spine of 
better days like the deafened clicks of a blue lipped off the beat pendulum 
I just wanted to be something more than enough of my God I don't think I'm 
breathing Jesus Christ when did I stop breathing oh my God I can't hear 
myself breathing this is all I know of flying my eyes set on you like stains 
in memory of romance
looking forward to a flatlined love affair the comfort of a dire 
lovesickness I've come to cherish bed sores and the salt in my own tears my 
beautiful affliction your kiss festers like a boil I find myself ugly in 
your eyes of asylum scenery have you come to take me away take me away 
darling you are a disease that spreads like sunshine the vultures make a 
halo while they wait for me to die your fingers crawl like flies on peeling 
flesh paralyzed you warm me in a cold sweat deadened but moving in seizures 
loving in fits of disillusional blurs don't you come near me buried above 
ground and rotting you can't take the corpse from his cold this is not a 
sickness if I beg it's an addiction throw your flowers to the fever I'm an 
abscess with a heartbeat an armspan of dirty needles and a rusted peices 
flowers mask the decomposing passion is watching how fast I can deteriorate 
desperation is a clotting incisionParalysed cannot move at all
From the imminent strike of the beast
From the depths of hell the deep blue sea
The demon has come for the feast
Attack is swift attack is fast
Life flashes before your eyes
When the devil strikes there's nowhere to hide
All around shall hear your cries
With crippling pain blood spills from your veins
Its time to face your demise
A thousand knives ripping through your flesh
Through your blood the beast shall rise
In the jaws of the killer your blood starts to flow
Salvation is all that you seek
With every bite the sea starts to change
Your blood shall stain the sea red
Servant of death
Killer from the deep
Your final breath
Death you shall reap
Eyes of black
And a heart made of stone
Shark attack
You've entered the killing zone
Watching over savage grounds
Within his laws you are bound
Pulling strings he makes your every move
Bodies mark your path to take
In these fields you'll not awake
Cut down your final place of rest
In this world he calls his own
The loss begins the seed is sown
The futile battle for your life and soul
Stalking through an unknown land
Your life is taken by his hand
No one can escape the god below
The skies turn red and wait to fall
Dawn of destruction await its call
To darkest black this land falls to its knees
Do or die his only words
Say your prayers can they be heard
In the chaos you find that you are lost
Let the heavens bleed
We hunt for reverence not greed
From heaven we angels fell
Banished to the kingdom of hell
Holy war wages strong
Mankind stands and looks on
Loyalties meaningless
Our faith in you it now turns to dust
In you we trusted
But you condemned us all
In you we trusted
So now your kingdom shall fall
Mankind shall face our wrath
Their burning souls light our path
Blood shall cover the land
Sentenced devastation on our command
Guard your heavens gate
You'll fall regardless of fate
We'll take back what is ours
Paradise forever ruled by our hand
In you we trusted
But you condemned us all
In you we trusted
So now your kingdom shall fall
A dead dawn's mist unearthly cries
From shallow earth the cursed rise
A life of death broke and decayed
They walk again to bleed the day
Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
The periled souls have gained new birth
They march again to reap the earth
Desecration darkest times
The living suffer for their crimes
Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
Trapped by terror hopeless plea's
Last prayer to none fall to your knees
Save one bullet for the end
On bitter peace you can depend
Acceptance
For the time draws near
The darkest hour is here
Repentance
For your sins gone by
Prepare to be taken by
The living dead
The living dead
The thirteenth strike
The demons come out to play
The witching hour
They hunt for flesh the prey
All hallows eve
The dead shall rise once more
Hell unleashed
This evil beats down your door
Repent all your sins
Pray to the above
For God to save your flesh and your soul
Terror never gives
Delusion never lies
All hallows eve once more gains control
Start to sweat
The blood runs cold in your veins
Afraid to move
Fear takes hold of the reins
On this night
Your loved ones return like before
Run for your life
Your loved ones themselves no more
Repent all your sins
Pray to the above
For God to save your flesh and your soul
Terror never gives
Delusion never lies
All hallows eve once more gains control
Living in a world of solitude submerged by falsity and ignorance
where man live for his own forgiving his Source
this is our Age Godsless as Nietzsche said
but Gods will never die and the time will come
when our Forger will rise in front of his creatures
and the Revenge of the Black Souls banished from this Society
will take place
Darksome Night and shining Moon
East then South then West then North
Harken to the Witches' Rune
Here I come to call Thee forth
Earth and Water Air and Fire
Wand and Pentacle and Sword
Work thee now to my Desire
Harken ye unto my Word
Queen of heaven Queen of Hell
Horned Hunter of the Night
Lend your Power unto my Spell
Work my Will by Magic Rite
Power of Land and Sway of Sea
Might of Moon and gift of sun
Do as I will and let It be
Chant the Spell and It be done

ALONE in a world of light
ALONE in the reign of christ
THE BEAST resting in the deeps of Ade
THE FEAST I'm preparing
MY HANDS stained with blood
A CORPSE bleeding at my feet
THE WIND rose from the North has dropped
THE SLAUGHTER now begins
FATHER You come at last
SATAN You are here for us
THE BEAST in the deeps of Ade awakes
THE END gets near
WE SERVE YOU
WE SERVE YOU
WE SERVE YOU
WE SERVE YOU
Spirit of the Unknown Domain
Father forgotten by your children
A long journey You endured
through stranger reigns now here
As an ageless Soul upon Stormy Oceans
You travelled to reach your lost sons
Master here we are
Waiting for Your coming
Lost is our Source
Mislaid is our Goal
Oh my King You're here at last
I swear by Your Dark Throne my total obedience
I seal this Oath with my blood
Make whatever You want of our lives
they're yours and so this world
Finally He arrives to the Place
where His people live
Rage when He sees another Lord
on His jewelled throne
For years the battle lasts
leaving only corpses and dust
at the end our King slays His enemy
NOW HE SITS ON HIS THRONE
Master here're our Souls
Meaningless as we born
Slaves to the Dark Domain
Fighting for our Black Faith
Darkness fills the Air Stench of putrid things in it
Ancient monuments to a forgotten christ are burning
his followers are hanged on every tree their flesh is food for the birds
their Souls are the dish of our Lord
I wander
With my mind
My true strength
My free hand
Find the Way
Reach the Pain
Then a day
I realise
Where to dig
Where to find It
Beyond the Pain I pass senseless to this body
my Soul is free to wander in the Realm of Nothingness
and here I find the Essence banished in a Rubin Tower
Yes I find It but I cannot catch It 'cause my Body is calling me
More Pain I need to go beyond the Wall of Flesh
the Gate to a greater Knowledge is not open yet
Your Life My Life
Your Life My Life
Your Life My Life
Your Life My Life
What is this what you say
Your road to life has been paved
You think you're someone I should adore
Because you say you got your foot in the door
Success to life isn't a suit or tie
But to you it is the bottom line
Stand back and take a good look at yourself
The friend I once knew is now on the shelf
Don't you think it's only fair
To share the feelings we have
Finding out what's been done
Can't you see your life is no fun
This is my life not your life
All I wanted was the best
All of this was a test
Gave all I had gave my love
Now you just push and shove
You pretend things do work
In the end one is hurt
Put you through the blasting hell
We are EXCEL
I tried so hard to make things last
Now we know we went too fast
Can you see this must halt
All I know  it's your fault
I'm insecure
I'm insecure
I'm insecure
I'm insecure
You just think you make sense
Just wake up you're in a dream
Split Image of someone else
Why can't you just be yourself
Split Image  Wake up
Split Image  Wake up
Split Image  Wake up
Split Image  Wake up
Never mind my feelings you never really cared
So much hatred I can't bear
Get out of my life that's all I want
Now you'll receive personal onslaught
You've got the mind of someone else
Why do you exist You seem to blame
Never in my mind seem to help
You're not the same you're back to your own self
Stand up in what you believe in
There is no remorse
Beware of the consequences
To take force
Striving for the fear
It's the only sense
The end people suffer
In the abuse in silence
Your mind obviously has to be the stronger one
Only use the force to your last resort
Take all you've learned and put it all upon
Release the bitterness but Never Look Away
Never Look Away
Stand up and look proud
Keep your head up high
Never Look Away
Visions of your love
Drew me closer I couldn't get enough
The presence of your hate
Gave me the dreams in which I relate
You got the right to make up your mind
You're livin' your own free will
But if you start to mess with my head
I'll go in after to kill
Said that you loved me
Obviously lying  it's easy
That's all I can take
For you now your life is at stake
You got the right to make up your mind
You're livin' your own free will
But if you start to mess with my head
I'll go in for the kill
I don't care what I'm in your eyes
Wreck Your World
I don't care what I'm in your eyes
Wreck Your World
There is something I'd like to say
Shut up kid you're in the way
Check in 900 AM it's time to work
I am the new sales clerk
Good morning sir here is your change
Have a good day this is a pain
What's the use of working this store
When people are such a bore
I'm treated like a number
What a waste of my summer
Good morning sir here is your change
Have a good day this is a pain
I'm on time  is there something wrong
I'm working hard and for SO long
Can't you see I'm doing something right
Yeah I know it's inventory time
You're all alone alienated
Figure your thoughts Do you make it
We can too it's in the heart
Set Yourself Apart
Figurize your views do you really
Or is it just security
We can too it's in the heart
Set Yourself Apart
Listen to yourself
The Joke's On You
The Joke's On You
The Joke's On You
The Joke's On You
It all started when I went to school
You were playing me as the fool
I laugh
We laugh
I laugh at you
Screaming at me you're wasting my time
Your opinion is not worth a dime
I've been waiting for this day so long
That's why I'm writing this song
I laugh
We laugh
I laugh at you
Because The Joke's On You
First pretend that you care
Then you turn and declare
That you're not with me
Where does that lead thee
You became my enemy
How can I stand free
Your clone is so cruel
Now I'm Looking For You
Looking For You
Looking For You
Looking For You
Looking For You
Why must you have to change
You are what they say
My heart is no fool
Now I'm Looking For You
I don't know what it is
Inside me it takes the grip
Never letting go it plays its game
Scrambling your mind you're now trained
I try to stop it but
It won't go away I'm in its rut
God Please try to spare me
Take my soul and set it free
It won't leave me be
How can you set it free
Please help me Lord
Spare my life pull up on the cord
Give me the chance to live
The chance that I dreamt
The chance to give
If I knew for sure
I'd Spare The Pain that I endured
I pray to God
For His help
What is wrong
Only He can tell
Why can't this just go away
Is this the reason I have to pay
What's there to hold me back
Is this the way to keep intact
I don't know what's going on
The life of God please don't be gone
We saw the fear in the enemy's eyes
We feel the confusion in other minds
Still we don't turn away fighting for death and glory
In the lands of the kingdom of the raven
Still we don't turn away now we will tell a story
We are the soldiers of heaven
We are the men we are dying for gold
They are the unholy the sacrifice their soul
A long day will come the day you set me free
A long day will come in a land across the sea
This is the time for immortality
This is the place for eternity
Oh voices
Brave and faithfull in war and in peace
Guardians for all this times
With armour and sword and never on our knees
Keepers of the the sacred lines
All your life you where serving willingly
Fighting the darkness for eternity
heaven
Dr ruhm wird cho u d ehr blibt nid schto
mir wandere i nes land fasch ringsume Strand
The glory will comewe will never be gone
Travelling in your land for keeping your hands
Travelling through your land to keep our hands
Across the rivers across the lakes over the mountains without a break
Across the meadows trough forests trough the valley like a quest
The march begins the march for the right the march through the darkest night
Across the rivers across the lakes
Across the meadows trough the forests
Looking up to the sky acid rain burning in my eyes
On a path the journey takes us south to where the sun will rise
fading moon in the sky is what they talk about
Why are we destined to wander throught time let the dreams come true
Across rivers across lakes
Across meadows trough forests
Stories are made to be told here is one that I know
Too many nights without days too many days we were lost
fading moon in the sky is what they talk about
Why are we destined to wander throught time let the dreams come true
Zoberscht uf däm Hügu warte ufs Zeiche ir Nacht
wärde dänke wie mängi Schtunge mir furt si üsre Stadt
Looking up to the sky acid rain burning in my eyes
On a path the journey takes us south to where the sun will rise
For death and glory for sun and rain
Living without midnight and no more pain
Death and glory
When the stars begin to fall when the way begins to end
Open your eyes and look around somewhere in this land
moments of magic as we are standing behind the shadows of this wall
Banners flying so high horns begin to play
We are standing here face to face
Like thieves in the night sword by sword
We are standing here face to face
Like thieves in the night sword by sword
at the will of a lord for honour and gold
Royal dignity
Have you ever flown so high on the wings of hope
Have you never broken the rules for cross and robe
for cross and robe
For death and glory for sun and rain
Living without midnight and the end of the pain
moments of magic as we are standing behind the shadows of this wall
Banners flying so high horns begin to play
Läbe u Tod Sunne u Schnee
Füres Läbe nachem Tod fürd Sunne nachem Schnee
We die for you on this stony ground to the greatest sound of battle
falling we find no sleep I give you my soul to keep
Shining bright the last golden night we will take the lost way home
I walk alone on the deadly line
Over the bridge I ran
Where my wife is waiting
Bearing the wounds in my soul
I hear the voices in the night Somewhere still he cries
feel my end is in the light where the soldiers lie
Sleeping in the haze of the morning sun
Sailing away to where the sunlight comes from
Sleeping in the haze of the morning sun
Like the wings of the dragon where it all began
I see where I've been in my live
I said that I will never die again
I see myself walking without fear
My own chamber will be the last thing I will see
I hear the voices in the night Somewhere still he cries
feel my end is in the light where the soldiers lie
Sailing away where the sunlight comes from
This is the silent song close your eyes and tell me now
hear the voices the voices in your mind
What have your enemies done with the lives they have counted on
tell us what they have found and tell us what they have found
They saw the clouds they heard the thunders
They feel the suffering in the wind
Wake up and find yourself
brothers side by side
your gave your swords to keep us alive
we are falling down closer to the ground
fight and die and I will follow now
Life is nothing but the time of decay take the ending path
Endless skies behind nameless graves
must be a brave
Screams in the night in a misty night
welcome to the halls under the sky
We are never going back through the pages of the past
now we wish the sky would say
Would say would say would say
This is the silent song
close your eyes and tell me now
They saw the clouds
they saw what your enemies have done
This is the silent song
close your eyes and tell me now
They saw the clouds
they saw what your enemies have done
Illuminated skies Liechtermeer
somewhere in the night i der nacht
we must die ha d Schtärne gseh
somewhere in the light I der schlacht
This is the silent song
close your eyes and tell me now
hear the voices
the voices in your mind
We're falling we're running
this is the endless calling
We're fighting we're dying now
We're falling we're running
this is the endless calling
We're fighting we're dying now
Tonight we fight my brothers in arms tonight my life is in your arms
Born for the battle born to the fight for the cross and for the right
Guardians in front of the line before the sun will shine
Guardians of the cross in the front line before the sun will shine
Soldiers they came soldiers they did fall we shall end them all
Oh Voices
I breathe feel my mind I breathe feel life
I breathe feel my mind I breathe I am alive
Through the dark of night I saw my brothers fall
Behind the walls of this town we're waiting for the fall
And they told us we were winning heroes of the forgotten time
Thousands of my brothers must be gone only 42 guardians in my lines
memory of the forgotten souls somewhere in this night
memory of the forgotten sons somewhere in this light
In the memory of the forgotten sons somewhere in this light
Burg zum Schutz und ou gägs Füür escape to the castle of angels
Burg für üsi Lüt mit iserne Tür escape to the castle of angels
The Siege
Pray
As soldiers ravage the earth at night
their swords and shields at to their side
The time has come for all of us
To find the end where your must die
The king holds the cross to his eyes
for his victory he's left behind
the king rides into the dark of the night
Towards home soldiers side by side
Oh voices 
oh lord please come to me
and give me the armour of gods
one day you will see
warriors in the armour of gods
Time flies away away from me
It has gotten out out of reach
The whole land is turning I will survive
Remember the tales memories will keep us alive
As soldiers ravage the earth at night
their swords and shields at to their side
The time has come for all of us
To find the end where your must die
voices of freedom in the howling wind
dragons fly free with their mystic wings
Strong and proud banners at the top
Somewhere on the endless rock
This is the place this is the grave
Where my brothers lie
Horns and flutes speaking final words
Its time to pray together with the lords
Heat and fire the rage inside my head
Children and wives taking away their last bread
This is the place of the standing Stone in the middle of the street
This is the place of the standing Stone in the middle of the street
Fire wind and thunder nothing can destroy the holy stone
Time rain and soldiers nothing can break the holy throne
I think of old times when I look into your eyes
Remember the days we fought sword in the hands
follow the stars hovering darkness
rage is so deep and the journey is endless
Soldiers are ready for die
Füür Wind sogar der Donner nüt zerschtört dr heilig Schtey
und mir kämpfe bis es ändi vor Wäut und ihr dänket mir kämpfet für Gäut
voices of freedom in the howling wind
dragons fly free with their mystic wings
Strong and proud banners at the top
Somewhere on the endless rock
Treasures in the name of gods
books of eternity power of this words
Faces the mirror knows this crime
a broken promise one more time
it's just the pain just another day in the fire
it's just another way
it's just the pain just another day in the fire
it's just another way
why there is a open flame
Burning in my soul with endless pain
I try try another way
Someone's king has to pay
walk alone in the dark with you in the shadows I run
fight alone in the light with you behind the clouds and the sun
walk alone in the dark with you in the shadows I run
fight alone in the light with you behind the clouds and the sun
Treasures in the name of gods
books of eternity power of this words
Faces the mirror knows this crime
a broken promise one more time
Schtärbealleini ir nacht
wärdemir nit mit dir macht
kämpfemit au üsre chraft
üs ergänzedas s jede es schafft
Schtärbealleini ir nacht wärdemir nit mit dir macht
why there is a open flame
Burning in my soul with endless pain
I try try another way
Someone's king has to pay
A crimson sun rises
See the beast in disguise
Gathers legions and armies
For the time is soon at hand
From the north they are marching
Calling forth all the righteous
The crusade will begin
And a war shall rape the land
A struggle fought beyond the veil
Their armies clash  Heaven and Hell
A secret war beyond the veil
Walk with angels or where Lucifer fall
Our lives at stake beyond the veil
A bloodred darn who will live to tell
Another realm beyond the veil
Where our nightmares shall dwell
Violence and bloodshed
While the stars turning bloodred
Swords clash and souls weep
Armageddon has come at last
Fiery blades glisten
While the black steel delivers
Archangels and demons wage war
While the spell is cast
In this world of hate and pain
I march against the intolerance
People don't understand it don't like it
Don't want it but I never give up
Many managed to stay on top
'cause they've been always true and real
Sometimes when I'm lying in bed
I close my eyes and start to dream
When the moon stands high
And sheds its light
All the dark clouds disappear
Then I get up
And walk outside
To the dark night without fear
The tranquility is brilliant
Together we'll make it through
Now the time is right
To set my anger free
Many managed to stay on top
'cause they've been always true and real
Sometimes when I'm lying in bed
I close my eyes and start to dream
When the moon stands high
And sheds its light
All the dark clouds disappear
Then I get up a
And walk outside
To the dark night without fear
I see the crowd
High on a hill
And I will soon be there
I can't believe
I realize
My friends are everywhere
He was just a mad man a mad man like me
He got a lot of friends but was to blind to see
And then it happened they turned on him what a shame
He didn't understand it couldn't take the blame
Together he stands with all his friends
Together they take their bloody revenge
Together they fight side by side
Together they die tonight
A few years later he remembered with fire in his eyes
And tears start to fall as he slowly realized
The sacrifice they made for him to hard to take
And in the end he made a choice for his brothers sake
Together he stands with all his friends
Together they take their bloody revenge
Together they fight side by side
Together they die tonight
I see you bleeding and we're running out of time
I see you fading your face as pale as lime
I can not save you can't bring you  back to life
Now I must leave you my one lonely wife
I now all the answers they are running through my head
I hear these voices they almost drive me mad
They tell me don't stop they tell me leave tonight
They tell me do it and you can win the fight
A blackened landscape a sun without no light
My soul in ruins a neverending fight
I ride on forward my horse it leads the way
A Quest of honor through darkness and decay
Further he walks into the darkness
Corruption defiles as he enters the gates
Onward to fate and into the darkness
Leaving the light while his master awaits
All his life devastation
Falling faster endless pain
Another day godforsaken
Slowly driving him insane
Blackened memories neverending
Shattered body crucified
Lifeless figure descending
Greeting the eternal night
Further he walks into the darkness
Corruption defiles as he enters the gates
Onward to fate and into the darkness
Leaving the light while his master awaits
Deadly Sins deeds unspoken
Shall haunt him for eternity
No final words no redemption
As the reaper claims his fee
A broken path blood and ashes
Shivering he marches on
The devils pawn demons laughing
Now reap the seeds that you have sown
Born in the ghetto no future in life
They played with toys and I played with knifes
They are all on top I'm chained to the ground
They swim in their money I'm calling them out
I'll take it no longer cause I had enough
You better watch out because I am tough
I'm on my way try if you want
No one can stop me now
I'm on my way never give up
I climb the mountains straight to the top
I spit on your money my soul is not for sale
Don't live by your rules don't believe in your tales
I'm all out of tears devoid of all pain
But I keep on running like thunder and rain
I'll take it no longer 'cause I had enough
You better watch out because I am tough
I'm on my way try if you want
No one can stop me now
I'm on my way never give up
I climb the mountains straight to the top
A sign shines in the desert
On a maze in the sand
It watches and treasures
The secret of the land
An old man approaches
For the final sacrifice
A scream the name Asha
The demon has arrived
When the Stormrider awakens on this barren plains
He brings forth her justice and the cold desert rain
It's time to enter my children
The world of man at your feet
Devour everything on earth
Darkness is spreadin' its seed
No one can escape our wrath
Asha is heeding our call
It is too late everything is over
The Blood Angel will claim all your souls
I am power and I am pain
I am the one who is to blame
I am a beast and I am mad
I am the goblin under your bed
I'm the dream maker
It's my destiny
I'm the soul taker
And your evil dream
I am near and I'll get you soon
I will transform in the bright full moon
I am a beast and I am mad
I am the monster inside your head
He came with the winds from the east
Unleashed from the north to the west to the south
You better run
He can hold you warm he can freeze you like ice
Just by a word Lord of the Storm
You better hide
Wherever you'll go
my black sword will sing
You'll always remember
the darkness I bring
That is my name
I am the Stormbringer
Now that I realize what's up to me
It's just like I thought
I can't believe
Now feel the power and might
No one survives on my side
Yes it is true
Wherever you'll go
the mist shall reveal
You'll always remember
the kiss of black steel
That is my fate
I am the Stormbringer
The night my companion bowstring and steel
Dark knowledge I carry no moon can reveal
They killed all I treasured now I make them pay
Their bodies all broken shall scatter my way
A warriorchampion a lord of the blade
Slayer of darkness and master of fate
The soul of the hunter in search for his prey
To banish all evil the reckoning day
Immortal in legends his trail of revenge
His deeds unforgotten he'll prevail in the end
The blade of the hunter shall come for them all
To challenge his honor the price is your soul
This sword I was given by mages of old
To grant me my vengeance its blade greets me cold
The path I have chosen I walk to atone
Forever the hunter forever alone
Bloody bastard is all she said
As I knelt in front of her bed
I cannot take it the pain clouds my eyes
It hurts a lot but I make a choice
I'll set the hell on fire
I let all fires burn
I burn it down to ashes
It's the lesson she has to learn
I close the door get out of your life
I'm leaving this place against my own advice
Nowhere to go for one soul to sell
There is only one place not heaven nor hellWe're filled with the stench of maggots
which confines and repress all that's pure and human
Controlled by fear
Kneeling in the darkness like fucking victims
The time has come to take that path to the edge were Worlds collide
Wrath unleashed
Scars fill our souls to the Point of no return
Principles are lost and broken
The deeds of few becomes the wrath of many
You brought us here over the fucking edge
Inhuman deeds deadly to those who care
Forgivness will never be granted you made your choice
One way path without fear
Wrath unleashed
Take control brake those chains of silence
Repress and destroy that stench fight fear with fear
The time has come to take that path to the edge
were Worlds collide
Wrath unleashed
Rädda små svin med förtryck som vapen 
tuffa i grupp i den manliga gemenskapen
Känner bara 
Avsky  rent jävla hat
Avsky  rent jävla hat
Avsky
Vidriga kräk med hybris som kompensation
Roten till allt ont tomma skal utan funktion
Jag är inte en av er
Knyter mina nävar 
när ni står där och ler
Tänker aldrig hålla käften
kommer alltid slå ner på er
och er äckliga människosyn
Kommer aldrig vika mig för er och era vidriga ideal
Ni ska trampas på tills dagen ni förstår
Vermins unable to grasp the gift of Life
A poisonous breed cursed since the dawn of time
Conquering infecting and destroying all along it's path
The apocalypse in all it's prime
Masters of Death sweeping across the face of the Earth
Bearers of the plague striving to be gods
Creators of greed paperthin divinity justifies their deeds
Born of sin oblivious to the storm closing in
Mankind ignorant and blind
The apocalypse in all it's prime
Primitive minds living by preying on others
Aggressive by nature an allconsuming fire
Cutting each others throats spreading the plague
Possessed by Power rule as gods at any cost
Mankind ignorant and blind
The apocalypse in all it's prime
The apocalypse in all it's prime
Mankind ignorant and blind
The apocalypse in all it's prime
Lifeless tools standing in perfect lines
Ready to serve the greater good
Slaves to cause unknown bearers of inhumanity
Fall in line  no complains accepted stay low or get detected
Do or die  accept your fate you got nowhere to hide
Disposable parts made of flesh and blood 
oiled up by hate and deceit
Owned by men in suits soldiers of democracy
We are the glory of man reaching for the gods
Statements of immortality
built upon soil of Deep red
We are the barriers of blood
We are the portals to paradise and divinity unknown
Messengers of filth built to protect to keep them in check
Instruments of fear monuments of the dead
Instruments of fear barriers of blood
We are dead dead as history gets
premonitions of the oncoming end
Empty Shells with no monsters to feed
divine glory at it's best
We are the barriers of blood
the monuments of the dead
Attention denied no strength to repair
The chaos inside anger supplied
Lies concealed within the serpents deceptive skin
No understanding of the deeds revenge is at hand
Hate reveals feeding the hand of man
Lies concealed within the serpents deceptive skin
Suffocating the mind spreading like a disease
Lies concealed within the serpents deceptive skin
Avlade till ett liv baserat på ignorans
Oförmögna att känna empati eller tolerans
Till slakt
Till slakt
Hjärntvätt deluxe i en nedåtgående spiral
Födda till att stöpas i samma form utan val
Utopiska visioner
om livet och dess mörker
En marsch mot ljuset
mot det som ni tror är frihet
Till slakt
Till slakt
Utopiska visioner
om livet och dess mörker
En marsch mot ljuset
Till slakt ni alla är på väg
Till slakt ni alla är på väg
En marsch mot ljuset
mot det som ni tror är frihet
En kamp mot livet och dess mörker
Everybody's watching eagerly awaiting moments of human decay
A twisted craving to be both predator and prey
A game were everyone are bound to fail
Entertainment is god and all of our souls are up for sale
Glorify the dumb
Glorify stupidity
Glorify a sick World in which failure is the only option
Consume and get consumed by fortune and fame
Two sides of stupidity we're all playing a loosing game
We live in a World of shit where all that's decent is gone
A new Colosseum where the weak are torn apart just for fun
I refuse to stand by in a World
Where the lifeless rule and the vicious follow
Enough is enough lock and load this has to end
It's not a crime to kill someone that's already dead
No longer normal according to fucked up standards
A menace in a World fueled with filth and driven by greed
Why even have civilization when nobody acts civilized
Enough is enough lock and load this has to end
It's not a crime to kill someone that's already dead
Enough is enough lock and load this has to end
It's not a crime to kill someone that's already dead
I'm a part of your world of shit
Where all that's decent is gone
Fueled with justice and driven by hate
And I refuse to standby in a world
Where the lifeless rule and the vicious follow
Don't you forget that you created me
Gear up get ready to defend all that you believe
cause those fucking vultures are ready to attack
Holding on to a lost cause as all out war lies ahead
I am the prey and they are waiting to get fed
In this valley only shadows find a way to live
In this valley only the departed have the will to forgive
Gagged and unable to speak the truth
Fake loyalty demanded so disturbing and sick
I will not fall into that hole of shadows
to be one of them to become a shell so hollow
My head is bloody but unbowed
Holding on to a lost cause as all out war lies ahead
I am the prey and they are waiting to get fed
I will not fall into that hole of shadows
to be one of them to become a shell so hollow
My head is bloody but unbowed
In this valley only shadows find a way to live
In this valley only the departed have the will to forgive

Illusions shattered an existence of lies
Facedown in an Alley observing faith with dead Eyes
Outnumbered from the start society marked as a blackened heart
Meetings with different titles puking my insides out
Trying to fit in make me free from sin empty my skin  illusions
Trying to fit in make me free from sin empty my skin  illusions
Vision of no hope will always be an illusion accepted fate
No stamina in the body nowhere to emigrate without help
Who to blame all I wish is to be like them get a second chance
No one answers no one care forever doomed in this nightmare
Observing faith with dead Eyes
Outnumbered from start
A vision of hope just and illusion
Standing on my knees waiting for the axe to fall
There's no light to follow I know that this is the end of all
Those ugly scars are starting to show again
as i'm fighting a war that cannot be won
Staring into eyes of indifference begging for mercy
Abandoned by hope left here with all that is filthy
Those ugly scars are starting to show again
as everything crumbles and turn into dust
The darkness fill my lungs
I'm choking on every breath
From this there is nowhere to hide
The world is dead to me as I'm left inside
Crawled up against the wall I'm feeding the flames
Unable to breath the air unable to break those chains
Those ugly scars are starting to show again
as I'm loosing faith and all turns to stone
Isolating myself from all that is pure and divine
A livingdead with all of hell left inside
Those ugly scars defines me
I'm dead inside never to be born against
Standing on my knees waiting for the axe to fall
There's no light to follow
I know that this is the end of all
Those ugly scars defines me and all that I am
Dead inside never toe be born again
I'm left with all of hell insideA myriad of literature aimed to educated
Lack of much definitive progress surly frustrates
The end of man is coming fast but few seem to care
Understanding but no way to change facilitates despair
Terminal habitation
Humanity deserved a punishment of gargantuan serverity
Crimes against each committed out of greed egoism and triviality
We are being but few of us can be called truly human
Humanity will overpopulate until the earth is ruined
Terminal habitation 
Am I just fanatical to be in love with nature
And invalid in judging man with nausea and hatred
Inauthentic zombies caught up in trivial lies
Egotistic habitation that causes earth to die
Terminal habitation
Fingernails subside between my teeth
To help me cope with stress and grief 
My fingernails could use some salt
Yet this calcium treat won't come to a halt
I've chewed my fingers red and sore
Now I'm jonsin' and need some more
An ounce of fingernails would be looking good 
I'd chew on yours if I could
Belief shouldn't come from your wallet 
But sincerly from your heart
Money and God  two different things
Try so keep them apart
What a contradiction of all they claim to be
How the fuck can your hard earned cash grant you a life in eternity
This is not true religion
This is a religous fraud
Don't think contibuting your money
Will bring you closer to God
I conclude this religion
Should be from your inner self
Don't waste all of your bucks
Keep them for yourself
Our government leaders make hundreds of mistakes
Their promises to the country are blatantly fake
They fuck with other countries where we don't belong
The way our system is run seems to me absolutely wrong
Voting for who The one with more money
Their election campaigns strike me as funny
I'm politically dismayed 
Our government leaders should listen to the people's voice
Let society have some say in a political choice
Deny infiltrating countries who don't want us there
And stop taking our money for defense which is not fair
Our taxes go Where Nuclear arms
These are the faces that will bring the world harm
I'm politically dismayed 
Unreal escapades false information
Your negativity impelos
The lies you pour out aren't conveincing
Attemps of looking good have failed
The constant plague of social status
Take your image out of hand
But your masterplan is reversing
You can't meet your own demands
You can't meet your own demands
No identity to call your own
As you hide behind insecure fears
Can you take control of your life
Or relinguish it to your peers
If I could gather all of the racists and sexists of this society
I'd give them all an invitation to my disembowelling party
DISEMBOWEL THEM
No need for your ignorance or excuse for your thoughts your existence is fucking foul
The hatred that you spew hinders race relations you deserve to be disembowelled

Romanian dictator emperor for life
Lived a life of luxury shared only by his wife
Growing fat like pigs eating meals fit for a king
Accumulating assets like none you've ever seen
Now the table's turned they were stripped of all they owned
The revolution's cast the dictator from the throne
With their execution so ends the tyranny
Two bullets from a rifle set the people free
Fighting for their rights
They toppled the regime
Pillage all their riches
Left them not a thing
Now they know the feeling
To reap the seeds they've sewn
Banished from the living
When they were overthrown
How did they feed the enormous greed
It took to satisfy their needs
They drained the country dry
As thousands had to die
But now the monarchy is nullified
The changing of the guard
They no longer deal the cards
The world demands democracy
It's the dawning of a time
When the system's redefined
Oppression's now a distant memory
Communism yields to the might the people wield
For a democratic form of government
For their blatant disregard
They have suffered long and hard
It's time for a changing of the guard
No longer will they rule the land by genocide
The traces of their empire have all been liquefied
Political reform has gotten underway
Now they're free to speak before they'd only pray
Freedom is contagious it's spreading far and wide
The Berlin Wall has fallen there's no need to divide
They walk across a border where many tried and failed
Others died but not in vain the people have prevailed
Fighting for their rights
They toppled the regime
Pillaged all their riches
Left them not o thing
Now they know the feeling
To reap the seeds they've sewn
Banished from the living
When they were overthrown
How did they feed the enormous greed
It took to satisfy their needs
They drained the country dry
As thousands had to die
But now the monarchy is nullified
Oh say can you fucking see
The missiles fall like rain
Bloody mountains majesty
Dead bodies on the plain
By the bombing's eerie light
See the crimson waves of red
What so proudly they all fell
The twilight of the dead
America  the violent
The indifferent
God shit his grace on me
America  the arrogant
The belligerent
Will live in infamy
We the people for no people
Secure the blessings of tragedy
Do ordain we have established
The scar spangled banner
We pledge allegiance to no god
Only to the blood
Liberty is just a dream
When dying in the mud
This the land of the deceived
Home of the depraved
Bombs they drop like falling leaves
And the deadly flag still waves
Red  the beautiful color of blood
Flowing like a stream
White  the color of bleaching bone
Lovely and obscene
Blue  the bruising color of flesh
Battered ripped and torn
The colors of the flag of hate
Of violence and porn
What you see is what you get
You haven't see the bloody trail yet
I'm no patriot just a hatetriot
Blood sport my sure bet
See the flag get a body bag
Salvation from a 44 mag
Nothing left no one saved
Cause our goddamn motherfucking bloody ass
Banner still waves
You put your faith in Christianity
I put mine in artillery
My M16 my lord and savior
Christ never done me a motherfucking favor
Pay for all of those in pain
For those who died in vain
Scars from battle nevermore
Still we march off to
War
War
War
War is my shepherd
Hate it if we can't comprehend it
Kill it if we don't understand it
Pray to god and your fate is sealed
As you die alone in the killing fields
Farewell Graham and Farahkahn
They need god I need napalm
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition
My sermon is my demolition
War
War is
War is my
War is my shepherd
It is no mystery
What you get is what you see
You betrayed my loyalty
You've gone and done me wrong
Now I do you harm
My revenge is guaranteed
You stabbed me in the back
Spit right in my eye
Dragging me into the fray
Take you out right you off
There's never enough
Ways to throw you away
You'd better start runnin'
Cause you know that I'm comin'
Cocked and loaded and I never miss
I'm onto your game
And I'm layin' the blame
And I'm addin' your name to my blacklist
You should've thought twice
Cause your playin' with your life
You must have some sort of death wish
I haven't any doubt
That your time has run out
Cause I've added your name
To my blacklist
You tried to beat me
Thought you could defeat me
But how you we ever wrong
I rise to the occasion
Character assassination
To put you down where you belong
You've got a lot to say
When I'm so far away
Now you've got a problem with me
Take you out write you off
When I've had enough
Of your verbal debris
For all the shit you talk
You've never walked the walk
All you do is run and hide
Slander me slag me
You'd better body bag me
I'm not a man you should deride
I've heard everything
All your mudslinging
You better run as fast as you can
Take you out write you off
Are you brave enough
To stand up and fight like a man
Christ on a cross
Such a symbol of loss
Since what seems like the dawn of time
It's just an engine of grief
Yeah a bloody belief
One that has no reason or rhyme
You're crucifucked
And you're out of luck
If you put your faith in the flock
Your only sin
Is when you piss in the wind
They've never had any key to the lock
I believe in nothing
Least of all in the word of shit
So hide in your shroud of urine
Because I can't take the smell of it
God isn't great
Just an icon of hate
Intolerance and despise
Believe in me
And I will set you free
I never heard a bigger pack of lies
It's ludicrous
That anyone of us
Would want to be lead by the blind
It's all in vain
It'll be your bane
If you're looking for the divine
Forgive and forget
such an empty threat
Religion at the end of the blade
The insanity
Of Christianity
Is just a fucking masquerade
You're crucifucked
And you're out of luck
If you put your faith in the flock
Your only sin
Is when you piss in the wind
They've never had any key to the lock
In life you're moving forward
But sometime for the worse
Always keep a step ahead
Never in reverse
The cars are stacked against you
In everything you do
But you try to get out alive
When you don't have a clue
You always feel the tension
Breathing at your back
To be the best that you can be
To be on the attack
Kicking down the wall
And kicking your face in
Means I'm moving forward
My new life can begin
Forward march in your face
Taking back taking place
Before you die living fast
Take a chance hauling ass
Never no never no never
Move in reverse
Here I am I'm moving straight
Fuckin' forward and I'm taking all
The steps to blow on right past you
I'm never gonna back down to you
And all your people who think that
You're the best no one can
Beat you well I've got
Some news for you you motherfucker
There's a new man in town who isn't
Any sucker so if you don't back
Down I'll put my bat to an
Angry motherfucker such as yourself
Now I'm going to wipe out
All those who say they're first
I'll be the first in line
My attitudes the worst
Because I am so spoiled
And never second best
I will leave you in the dust
And lay your ass to rest
So never understimate
The mind of evil thoughts
I will bring you down
Spit you out before I'm caught
Because I have to power
And the upper hand
Everybody in the way
Will know that I'm the man
Forward march in your face
Taking back taking place
Before you die living fast
Take a chance hauling ass
They're everywhere and every place
Scum of the human race
Sticking to my skin like a rash
Society's their scapegoat
But I am the antidote
And it's time to take out the trash
The world's a big cesspit
Of puke and piss and dog shit
But I ain't gonna be its whore
Follow and I'll lead the way
Predators are now the prey
Results like these are hard to ignore
You may think I'm insane
Or maybe just a little absurd
What you don't understand is
I'm just culling
I know I'm not the only one
Who thinks that something must be done
To clean the garbage up off the street
Dare to look me in the eye
I bring the truth I never lie
To me they're just another piece of meat
The punishment will be swift and sure
For this disease I am the cure
No problem the doctor is in
My prescription for a better life's
A riffle or a razor knife
Remove whoever's under your skin
But please don't call it a murder
Cause murder's such a dirty word
What you don't understand is
I'm just culling I'm just culling the herd
When will everyone realize
Some people should be sterilized
Their tubes are only fit to be tied
All they do is shit and breed
Too ignorant to ever succeed
Stupidity should not be multiplied
Lend them not a helping hand
Or the future will be damned
The world will take a turn for the worse
The human race should be purified
Or we'll all be mongrelized
Implement the cure for the curse
You may think I'm a madman
Or maybe just a little disturbed
What you don't understand is
I'm just culling I'm just culling the herd
The honeymoons over and the loves gone sour
Her nagging has got you down
But you picked the wrong way to deal with it
You chose to slap her around
When you exchanged your wedding vows
Nobody said you may now fist the bride
Now that the little woman went and got her gun
The love ain't all that died
Jealousy
She knows you can't live without it
The bullet's speed
Cutting right through all your bullshit
Wedded bliss
Begane for her when the bullet's hit
Sixteen rounds in case she missed
Sealed with a fist
When she took your hand in marriage
It didn't mean right across the face
Small woman big man it takes a lot of guts
You're just a pussy in the first place
But now that your wedding chamber's
The one the bullet's in
Brave man look at you not so tough
When the hammer's cockin'
The little woman had all the shit that she could take
Her intuition said lock and load
Heman what's your plan to get out of this
She's gonna fill your ass with bullet holes
Guess who's bigger when she's squeezing the trigger
I got news it isn't you
When they carry your body out over the threshold
You'll wish you never said I do
Forgive and forget
A sign of weakness
No more mouths to feed
Say what you will some hearts bleed
Stay away from me
Now my conscience feels no more
Hold my own from no one
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated
I can't deny anything
I'm sick and tired I'm burnt
You can't rely on me
To be the one who saves you
I get off on negativity
Makes me laugh to see your strife
I won't succumb to your numb
I owe nothing to no one
Are you sick of me
I don't care
Never be a kiss ass
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated
Feed me the blame like it's my fault
I'll put it back in your face with an assault
Crack in the back and I'll raise up
To crush mindless fools like you
Like you
Like you
Like you
Forgive and forget
A sign of weakness
No more mouths to feed
Say what you will some hearts bleed
Stay away from me
Now my conscience feels no more
Hold my own from no one
No degree of guilt possessed
Now I suppose that I am hated
Feed me the blame like it's my fault
I'll put it back in your face with an assault
Crack in the back and I'll raise up
To crush mindless fools like you
Throwing down
Comes from the land where night is day
The people live in fear
Been this way for oh so long
Another four thousand tears
Everyday he hunts to kill
You know he can't help himself
Same routine time after time
A way to seize the wealth
Drinking blood don't mean a thing
Life means even less
Impale your wife slay your son
Another gory mess
Born in hell left to die
Now out for all your blood
Living his life day to day
To stake you to the mud
What you see he don't care
Now you bleed start to stare
Cut you down rip you up
Watching warm blood run
Crush your skull strike him well
When you land just impaled
Freshly done there's no hope
Watching warm blood run
What you see he don't care
Now you bleed start to stare
Freshly done there's no hope
Watching warm blood run
Impaler
Impaler
Impaler
Impaler
When you feel the darkness calling out your name
Don't try to fight the power surge
Don't you laugh for this is not a game
Your powerless don't resist the urge
So many black hearts answering the call
Legions of the musically possessed
Congregations joining in our freeforall
Unleashing all the rage they've repressed
Come to us
Succumb to lust
Giving in to our ministry of sin
You know the drill
Do as you will
Dance like the demons of the din
All will yearn
For our nocturne
The dawning of our cult is at hand
Come and pray
We know the way
Bow to the tempo of the damned
We are all leaders of the horde
Keepers of the apes of wrath
Heed the call of the volume lord
High priest of the bloodbath
Serve unto us surrender us your souls
And great rewards you'll receive
And when the tempo has taken the control
Even the heretic's will believe
Do you know why you will
Always be a part of me
When I look in the mirror
I see you staring back at me
You can't help but make me feel alone
I'm lost and I'm losing all control
Why can't you just find your way back home
I feel you there but I know that you're not here
I'm falling faster now but my world is standing still
I still can't comprehend that I'll never see you again 
I pretend that you're with me until the end 
And I suspend my thoughts just to make amends
I'm falling fast these days and I think of all the ways that I can kick this phase
I set the world ablaze and I sit back and watch as it all decaysLiving amidst filth and dust
Crawling in mud searching for scraps
Excruciating stench of decaying remains
Constant starvation a state of nothingness
Failing the overlooked the ignored
Betraying the least of my brothers
You see them shivering in solitude
Excluded Imprisoned defenseless
You see them tortured abandoned
Laying on the ground left for dead
Failing the overlooked the ignored
Betraying the least of my brothers
Failing Me
A refugee in a strange land
Mistrusted and hated
Human beings denied fundamental rights
Exposed to fear and intimidation
Desperate cries of dismay  isolated
Like worthless creatures  nonexistent
Betrayal of the outcasts
You are the accursed goats herded to doom 
Turning away from the sight of the needy
Turn away from Me to a place for the wicked
Let me drift within your reach
Where I'm blameless and pure
Hold my hand  move forward
Take me to the gates of righteousness
Lead me on  by Your word
Enter through the gates of righteousness
At the threshold of reconciliation
To the land where nothing separates
From the promise of protection
Hold my hand  move forward
Take me to the gates of righteousness
Lead me on  by Your word
Enter through the gates of righteousness
Evidence of the ancient declaration
Once dead  detached elevated
To live by the faultless law of liberty
My darkness drowned in the depths of the sea
Open up the gates I will enter
Open up the gates I will enter through the gates
I'll enter through the gates  the gates of the undying
I'll leave everything behind and enter  enter
Hold my hand  move forward
Take me to the gates of righteousness
Lead me on  by Your word
Enter through the gates of righteousness
Liberty  Undying
Inside dark suffocating shades
Behind black blinds
A price to pay
Pains of becoming a lesser man
Suffer from doctrines 
Stuck in my head
Lies from the pits of hell
Dwelling in wastelands
Lead me to the deepest wells
Never poisoned by the world
Grace the only nourishment
Forced through the desert
The burning heat strips my motives
What is the true nature of the heart
Dwelling in wastelands
Lead me to the deepest wells
Never poisoned by the world
Grace the only nourishment
Will my own good salvage my soul
Will I follow to where You are
Incomprehensible captivating
Flawless and beautiful
By the desire of the Creator
The essence of life poured out in every being
Not by mere chance but with a purpose
Shaped in the likeness of the Triune
Come into existence to love to worship to connect
Seeds come alive a mystery hidden from man
In perfect balance a perfect composition
Trusting eyes sparks of life
Completely dependent yet without fear
Surrendering to the father's arms
Vitality provided from the source
A gift beyond human reach
Not bound by time and space
Destined to the eternal  not bound by time
Incomprehensible captivating
Flawless and beautiful
Provider of so much care
I'm aware of my shortcomings
In my sight all pointed out
How can spoken words be kept
And my heart be unburdened
Still You're here  come surround
Oh I welcome You  come surround
Will Your eyes be upon me
Despite my distorted being
Will Your presence follow my faltering moves
Through times of failure
Yet I know Your light represents something anew
Affirming my value
With light comes certainty
Exposing the light from the enemies around me
With light comes awakening
The visible truth
So sick of being held back
My mind is still paralyzed
Am I haunted  will they ever leave me
The attacks bring afflictions to my weary soul
Still You're here  come surround
Oh I welcome You  come surround
Pure and clear Majesty
Endlessly turn your gaze to me
Behold the Sun
Surrender to its will
My face a reflection 
It will surely shine
Light so sweet cover me
Truly the light is sweet
A pleasant sight it is for the eye
To behold the Sun
Omnipresent never fading
Captivating nowhere to hide
Energizing fulfilling
Circling at distance
We're all left here showered in light
Everything is so clear
Light so sweet cover me
Revitalization illumination
Come energize spiritize
Colorize mesmerize
Sun persist turn your gaze to me
Through the mist turn your gaze to me
Empowered prepared  on a mission
We are the ministry
There have been doubts of the vocation that called us to act
Whether we are still witnesses of the great Love
There are inconsistencies between life and command
Are we truly faithful to the glory of the One
Once we were ministers servants of the Kingdom
Declaring life at the death's door
With eyes full of hope we reached for the treasures
The surrounding wind brought us to stars so bright
Are we lost in addiction of people's recognition
Adopting the path of the selfcentered
Are we about to join the ranks ignoring our tasks
Like dying fools like the betrayers of light
Empowered prepared  on a mission
We are the ministry of light
Once again we gather  in the shades around the fire
Tensions from the past traced in the atmosphere
Bonded by the Spirit  healing the wounds
Recalling the passion a glimpse of the dream
I've found peace
Your Breath of Life strengthen my bones
In my deepest desperation and fear
Your presence within my heart
Above all else You stand mighty and terrible
Yet gracious and compassionate 
Slow to anger and of great mercy
Until the day I take my last breath
My soul will praise the Lord and everything within me
Extol His holy name
Your Breath of Life strengthen my bones
In my deepest desperation and fear
Your presence within my heart
Restoring power everlasting
When I call upon You You never abandon me
You preserve my heart
You invite me to a place of comfort
Lover of my soul Prince of peace
Generations past and generations to come
All will speak of Your sovereignty
There is no end to Your splendor
Your kingdom and power everlasting
In a place of peace and confidence
Bring us to complete unity
Adopted chosen  seekers of light
May all be one like You are one
So we can see the glory of the Son
Conversion  a new perception of reality
Relinquish  in pursuit of relief unyielding peace
Despised rejected  for the sake of a name
Wisdom vigor  transposed to the willing
Unveiling the obscure  the concealed truth
Anticipated Messiah  visible in the flesh
Believing accepting  inseparable Father and Son
May all be one like You are one
So we can see the glory of the Son
Guidance and strength  provided to endure
Alienated separated  yet part of the scheme
Purified by blood  protected from malice
Enabled to testify  declaring eternal life
In a place of peace and confidence
Bring us to complete unity
You have overcome the world
A new way for humanity
Anxiety fear
A life in chains
A clammy hand that grips the heart
Squeezing the joy out of everyday life
The perishable will clothe itself with the imperishable
The mortal clothed with immortality
O' death where is your victory
O' death why is your sting
Inadequacy shame
A notion of being small nobody nothing
A pain from deep within
Knowing I'm not the one I should have been
Loneliness emptiness
Withdrawing into myself
Confused about truth
Lost in the egocentric sphere of my pathetic life
O' death where is your victory
O' death why is your stingSo upon every side the sinners stood
Foerever lost in hearing the truth
Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew
Suffered long enough in fear
Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita
Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura
Ché la diritta via era smarrita
Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura
Esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte
Che nel pensier rinova la paura
Tant'è amara che poco è più morte
Ma per trattar del ben ch'i' vi trovai
Dirò de l'altre cose ch'i' v'ho scorte
I saw and still my heart doth shudder at it
One waiting thus
Even as it comes to pass
When the pain is closer
When the pain is near
In every turn and every world
He come undone
As i suffer no more
Ungracefully
No matter what in every turn
It follows you
Devouring your pain
Tant'era pien di sonno a quel punto
Che la verace via abbandonai
Ma poi ch'i' fui al piè d'un colle giunto
Là dove terminava quella valle
Che m'avea di paura il cor compunto
Guardai in alto e vidi le sue spalle
Vestite già de' raggi del pianeta
Che mena dritto altrui per ogne calle
I saw and still my heart doth shudder at it
One waiting thus
Even as it comes to pass
When the pain is closer
When the pain is near
In every turn and every world
He come undone
As i suffer no more
Ungracefully
No matter what in every turn
It follows you
Bodies of old
Irreplaceable in sin
And you forget your memories
For eternity
They are the scars inside
Die alone
Untrivial
As Death comes near
The tyrrants of the soul
Arrive
Devouring all your thoughts
And life
Sinfully
Await
To die alone untrivial
As my death comes dear
Leave
Leave me here
Turn and forget
Slow and incomplete
Flows this life
Calator prin lume
De sfarsit ma ating
Acolo undei lumea de apoi
Take All this pain
Wake From this dream
See the shades
Of nothingness
Through the light
Of your constant shame
Sorrow fell
Hard and blackened
On the altor of broken thoughts
Here and after
Deeper down
Where the descent began
Fear  no one else in this dream
Sorrow  scarring no one else
Stay in my dreams
Follow me
End your soul
Remorse feeds the pain
Even though
The soul bleeds
How hard a thing it is to say
What was this forest
Savaged rough and stern
Which in my every thoughts renewes the fear
So bitter it is
And death is a little more
But of the good to treat
Which there i found
Speak will i of the other things i saw
I cannot well repeat
How there i entered
So full was i of slumber
At the moment which i was abandoned
In a true way breath i have reached
And i saw and i felt
At the point i knew the valley was terminated
Which had when consternation pierced my hearth
Although upward i looked
And i beheld my shoulders
Vested already with the planet's rays
Which leadeth onto the night or day
Then it was the fear
A little quieter
That in my heart's like had endured throughout
And the night
Oh no the night which i had passed so pittiously
And even as he
He who disturbed my slumber
With his distressful breath
Turns to the word
Perilous
And gazed
And so did my soul
That still was playing ownward
Turned itself to be behold the pass
Which never
Never yet a living person left
After my weary body i had rested
The way resumed
I on this desert slope
So that the firm foot ever was the lower
And lower and
Lower above the rage of Death
Mourning the soul
Prays in void
He
Who meets the sorrow
All left in slumber
Soul dismembered
He who willingly suffers
The fall
From this world
Caught within
Remembering to uphold the rotting grief
From beyond the downfall
It lives
Sorrow folds me well
To be free to be one
From beyond the grave
It feeds
Sorrow folds me well
To be free to be all
Rest
For i have watched over you
Rest
For I am here
Why
Why in this torment must i sink
Why must i bleed
The fall
From this world
Caught within
Remembering to uphold the rotting grief
From beyond the downfall
It lives
Sorrow folds me well
To be free to be one
From beyond the grave
It feeds
Sorrow folds me well
To be free to be whole
In this poor tragedy
All seems veiled in more shame
Are we now dead
Yet
Are we now alone
Die with me
Devour your shame
Burn with me
Deny your shame
I sat in silence
I sat all alone
I felt the cold kiss of death
Feeling so warm
I sat in silence
Waiting my turn to be judged
I betrayed you
Don't fight it  embrace it with me
Suffer alone  You
Mortally sinned  I wish
That in your hands
Carefully bleeds your pain
In this poor tragedy
All seems veiled in more shame
Are we now dead
Yet
Are we now alone
All these sins are real
The titans who granted
My soul demise
My death
Not too long yet timeless
I reveal my wounds
Watch my own funeral
Fall with every tear
I bleed
No more reality
Suffering is real
The titans who granted
Soul's demise
My death
I am the dark apprentice serving Satan's will
I lie amongst darkness Christians I kill
Resurrection of ancient evil
I kill the god of the feeble
Promised an eternal life slowly fades away
I mock the crucifixion
I exist to create Christian extinction
As their souls fall to Hell and burn for eternity
I have been summoned by the evilest souls
To kill the Christians that plague the earth
I am from the black dominion
Beyond the infernal gates
Where their fate awaits
Taking the immortal soul
From the lifeless body
Evil from below Hell is where they reign
Armageddon has finally come
Billions of deserving now will die
The black wizard arrives from the east
The one that destroys known as the Stormraiser
Black winds arrive from the Northern lands
Wicked storms of tremendous lightning
Unleashed upon the earth to kill mankind
With fiery black skies and earthquakes of devastation
The Stormraiser stand upon the higher mountain
Watch his evil creation
Blessed under the sign of Hell the symbol of Baphomet
Lucifer in disguise
Conquer end the relics of Christianity
Tearing down the cross of Christ
Thrown to the ground in blasphemy
The helpless and weak victims under the sign of the goat
Now it's time to die
The fiery winds sweep across the landscape
The end of existence as we know it
The Stormraiser the mighty destructor
Forever dying and chanting his name
Stormraiser
Stormraiser
Stormraiser
Stormraiser
Across the river of Styx in the island of the dead
Awaits a Titan the shadow keeper of the underworld
Centuries of evil enter the realm of evil
Venomous blood flows through its veins
Twoheaded beasts guard the gate
Eyes of fire salivating jaws of blood
Slay the beast the time has come
In dark and misty caverns it awaits
Serpent head of evil lurking in the shadows
Hear the hiss of the venomous serpent
Glowing eyes face of death now turn to stone
Curse of the underworld
Look towards the shield see its face
Fires of the throne you will not be saved
Complexion cold as ice an entity of the unconscious mind
The beheaded Titan acidic blood
Curse of the underworld
Clawed stinging creatures come to form
From her blood they spawn up from the ground
Medusa serpent archer of the underworld now cast down
I am the shadow keeper
The evil will now be passed down
Curse of the underworld
Rise dead angels rise  Rise dead angels rise
From the depths I summon thee
Rise dead angels rise
Centuries have passed time stood still
Beware the prophecies they are real
Fallen angels that turned to dust will rise again
Satan we heed the call to triumph over the Father
Out of the boundaries of Hell we break the chains that bind us
Destroying the disciples of God challenging the holy laws
Guardians of Heaven face the rise of our fallen kingdom  rise of a fallen kingdom
Scorched black by fire hail to Satan
Necromancers of the earth hail to Satan
Bring forth the Father hail to Satan
Witness the persecution of our Father hail to Satan
Attack the doors of Heaven break apart its bars
Attack the barriers of Heaven take the walls by force
Open the doors of Heaven open wide the gate
I am the great shadow ruler of Heaven
Open the gates of Hell our rage ascending from the abyss
No door can shut us out no bolt can turn us back
Holy angels fall like rain from the sky
Turn to vapors mist upon the earth
We have brought down the Almighty
We brought down the forest of the east
The blood of man is the spirit of vengeance
Rise of a fallen kingdom
Rise dead angels rise Rise dead angels rise
The epic battle of good versus evil has begun
Now its time to reign in sin with this mighty war
Armageddon is now upon us
The dark serpent claims his rightful throne
As the earth has become Hell
See the Christians fall in defeat
The mightiest black legion
Now we will praise Hell as we now see God fall
Bound in chains
Hear the screams echoing in endless midnight
Darkness now embraces your life
Angels in Heaven they will cry
As the beloved God now dies
Blessed are the warlords of Hell
They destroyed their enemies
Holding their swords up high
The demise of Christians
The end of God the beginning of Satan's reign
Hail Satan one and all for it is his world
Blood of Christians is on our hands
Their bodies desecrate the landscape
Destroying all that your adore
Unholy atrocities of war
Rendered to dust dead in your crypt
Die for your mortal sins
Nuclear holocaust die for the sins of man
Rendered to dust ashes remain
Don't believe in the lies of eternal life there is no God
There is no existence after you die
You pray to a false god for He does not exist
Your destiny is to be buried in the ground
Or entombed in a mausoleum
Dead in your box maggots infest
Divine smell of rot as you are laid to rest
You're just a soulless corpse dead in your box
For you I have no remorse forever trapped you'll rot
You suffer from the incurable Christian faith
Laid to rest you are deceased won't escape the rotting
Resurrect eternal pain obsessed with death
Born to suffer punishment
Rendered to dust there is no afterlife
Only the end eternal strife
The clock struck at midnight the six conspirators met
He hid in the shadows to conceal his complexion
Cursed by a vile disease leader of a leper colony
Under a full moon we planned his death
Set ablaze a fire on the shore strong enough to penetrate the swirling mist
Out of the night an unearthly fog rolled in
For a moment's time they could see nothing
The ship crashed against the rocks the wreckage sank to the bottom of the sea
The fog recessed back across the waters and never came again
But when the fog returns the crew's lungs filled with salt water
Their eyes open staring into the darkness will search for the fire
That lead them to their death and my death
In a moment's time it will vanish watch as it recedes back across the seas
When mercury freezes when everything turns to mist
Look across the water into the darkness look out for the fog
Were it possible to raise the dead I would return his fortune
I am the sixth conspirator lead me to my death for the witching hour
From twelve to one belongs to the dead I am a thief I hold the keys to the tomb of gold
Set ablaze a fire on the shore strong enough to penetrate the swirling mist
Out of the night an unearthly fog rolled in
For a moment's time they could see nothing
Is this anything but a nightmare is all we see or seen a dream within a dream
When mercury freezes when everything turns to mist look across the water
Into the glowing darkness look out for the fog
Look out for the fog
Manifestation of the black spirit
I am the one that dwells in darkness I serve the will of evil
Hatred and disgust fills my soul
An undying hatred for Christianity
On the night of the crimson moon a metamorphosis now occurs
Within my black soul
Soon to bring the day of wrath in my black heart
The black spirit manifesting in me I am now an unholy creation
Having no memory of my former I am reborn
For I am the great manifestation of the black spirit
The burning desires of lust now fill my spirit with the women of holiness
I fornicate incubus of shadows and in their dreams
Planting deep my evil seed in the disciples of God
Procreating a new race of demonic drones unleashed upon the earth
To make Christianity extinct feel my vengeance upon thee
A holy death another Christian is murdered
In the name of Satan lord of the undivine destroying divinity
I am the manifestation of the black spirit
King of the nether world all will praise me
As all the churches burn to the ground
A star burns across the midnight sky crack of thunder
A bolt of lightning breaks the deaf silence
Show me the secret number show me the secret shape
Keeper of the secret names show me the signs
Look across the black seas look for the black horizons
Look for the eclipse of the sun look for the signs of Armageddon
Bring together which has been thinded bring together the bible
Utter his name in reverse the last name of God
Make me the one begotten son reveal to me upon this hour
Make me the one begotten son reveal to me upon this hour
The visions of a world start to uncreate heed thy blackened sun
Axis of evil at my command let him reign upon this hallowed night
Bring in darkness shade the light fulfill this tonight my destiny
Look at the midnight sky look for the black horizon
Look for the sweat upon the beast look for the sign in the prisms
Your pathetic life has come to an end Judgment Day has now arrived
Will you enter the gates of Heaven  Or will you descend into the realm of eternal shadows
Fall into darkness the eternal said
Burn for eternity
God has turned his back on thee you've lived a sinful life
As you are cast to Hell the smell of Hades upon you
In the lands of everlasting darkness Satan's realm now reigns supreme
Father Satan save me from the spell of Christianity
Eternal darkness now surrounds thee eternal suffering now is upon thee
Master Satan has spoken to thee vengeance is mine now for thee
Burning in Hell for eternity
We are all servents of Satan
What is thy bidding my master
To serve in the lands of everlasting darkness
It's the dawn of the Apocalypse
Satan's wrath will prevail
At the end of existence there is no resistence against the wrath of damnation
Pray for salvation begging for your soul knowing there is no hope
Witness the kingdom of Satan and his throne
The wrath of damnation end of creation upon the throne of apocalypse
End of life as we know it Earth becomes Hell the world is ruled by the angel whom fell
The dawn of a new age new world order
You were a hypocrite hiding behind the cross you bear
Once you were so high and mighty now you are a mirror of your former self
Witness the new day of suffering bowing down to the throne of beasts
It's the dawn of the Apocalypse
Satan's wrath will prevail
As the old world dies and the new one is born
Impaled servents upon inverted crosses whilst they're ablaze
This is the wrath of damnation
Upon the throne of ApocalypseWatching the victim plead
For an immediate death
Torture is the worst kind
Of brutal punishment
Life slowly erodes
Never ending agony
Unbearable pain
In and out of conciousness
Hoping for a fast death
That seems so far away
Beg for your death
Hoisted upon the meathook
Anally impaled
Rectum engulfing the meathook
In excruiating pain
Your screams cause delight
Watching in horror as your
your fucking sodomized
As this wasn't enough
Your knee caps were smashed
With hammers
Methodical torturing
Torture everlasting
Electric shocks to the ball sack
Cattle prod just warming up
Deprived of your manhood
Through the use of a cattle prod
pouring water on your genitalia
Blistered and burnt testicles
Turning and twisting
Ripping your rectum wide
Burnt flesh in the air
Down on the meathook you slide
Screams of pain being at the end
Gates of pain open up wide
If burnt testicles wasn't enough
Ice pick pierces burnt flesh
Fluid and blood leak through
wound just made
your screams are so loud
But no one can hear
It's living not dying is your fair
Shoved into your ureatha
Repitive stabbing of gentalia
Crimson streams exit your prick
Bludgeoned cock lies hopeless not much left
taking your last breath in the last moments
Died upon the meathook Mob boss satisfied
Body finally lies lifeless
Eyes sunken in turn green
Your coffin is a trunk of a car
Homemade funeral for the past
Another victim has been whacked
The smell of burning cinder
The crackle and pop of human flesh
The screams of my victims
I hear as I fade into the dark
Sit around the corner
With success in my obession
As I admire my work of art
Molotovs gasoline or a match
Or through any technique
I know how to acheive
To work my work of wonder
To my pure delight
I want to see it burn I wanna see you burn
The more people I can burn the better I feel
I want to see it burn I want to see you burn
Sometimes I see my victims
Choke on the dense smoke
But the ones I like best are
Burnt running flesh
See my victims running and rolling
Trying to put themsleves out
But I have them in my trap
Of death and fire
There is nowhere to run
There is nowhere to hide
There is no way out
Surrounded by fire engulfed in flames
I want to see you burn alive
I want to see it burn I wanna see you burn
The more people I burn The better I feel
I want to see it burn I want to see you burn
I want to play a game of smoke and fire
I want to burn your house to fulfill my lust
My heart starts beating fast as I douse your house
I know in a few minutes my goal will be achieved
Burn your house to the ground
Burn it down
I wil take your soul
Come into my chamber of obscurity
Why don't you come with me
Where violence is pleasure and so sweet
Horrible certainty
Never mind the blood stained walls the human bones
They're just a memory
The putrid stench of rotten flesh is sickening
A fragrance that I love
As I lure you into my chamber
Your skin turns a ghostly white
Submit now to my ghastly pleasures
or suffer the consequence
As I rape the life out of you
your life seems so worthless
Chamber of obscurity
Wretched and unthinkable
Torture and depravity
Chamber of obscurity
As you start to gasp for air to plead for your life
You won't be living long
You start to bleed you start to choke
the swelling starts
Beatings will never stop
As you lay in your own piss and feces
Vomit spews from your mouth
You feel like the lowest form of human life
a life that will soon be gone
As I lure you into my chamber
Your skin turns a ghostly white
Submit now to my ghastly pleasures
or suffer the consequence
As I rape the life out of you
your life seems so worthless
Chamber of obscurity
Wretched and unthinkable
Torture and depravity
Chamber of obscurity
Expressionless
Your limp now dead body
I have seen the death and horror
That makes me want to spew
Spew
Writhing contorting unleashing your soul
Your shrilling is music to my ears
Your terror in your eyes before you die
excites me
The illusion of you living is now gone
As you slowly slip away
My pleasure grows as you decay
As you think
Though of hopelessness
How much longer can this be
The hopelessness and agony
As you scream
Please God let me live
Screaming anguish never ending
Pleasure growing never dying
As you die
Forgotten
Memories and have been forgotten
You are no one just a passing victim
For my pleasures for my fornication
For your nightmares for your satisfaction
Sordid Degradation
Deep in the rainforest of Brazil
A tribe of fornicators
The raping ceremony from long ago
To violate the newborn
Once the infant is out of the womb
The village starts to line up
The baby is raped everyday of his birth
Until the day of his death
The elder fuck the younger ones
the young ones rape the elder
Primitive perversions
Retarded children are being born
Abuse the mother after labor
All they do is rape and fuck
Orally anally incest
Sodomoize the tribal chief
Anally invade the ugly wife
Pull her by the fucking hair
Jam a dick into her mouth
Listen to her gurgle cum
Like the fucking whore she is
Brutally raped by your best friend
Ambushed by behind the bastard
What can you do its tradition
Beat and gang raped by four others
Taking turns while they're laughing
But you know their days are coming
It's a lovely young girl's day
When the village takes their turn
They tie her to a wooden post
She starts to scream
She's knocked unconscious
and then probed with a fist
Starts to bleed profusely
From her tight little ass
Raping fucking it's tradition can't escape it
Rape Culture
Lurid Impurity
Lusting for the feeling of impurity
A feeling I cannot hold back uncontrollable
Wanting needing lurid impurity
Dreaming of a time when my needs are fulfilled
Embracing the feeling of impurity my need for filth
Fulfilling satisfying lurid impurity
Looking for a victim for my needs to be violated
Sickness in my mind twisted thoughts insane they
control me
Controlling every thought every move delving
into madness
Innocent people pray for my soul lurid impurity
Lurid impurity
I cannot believe the thoughts that cross my mind
They make some people puke they make me
get a hard on
Insanely sick and twisted I love it
I love it
Fulfilling Satisfying Lurid Impurity
My sweet pretty victim
Destined for defilement
Experience a horrible pain
Her heart will beat in my hands
Knock her out rip her organs
Rip them out tear them out
Knock her out rip her organs
Rip them out tear them out
Methodically take out her organs
With surgical steel and bare hands
I'll fuck her when she's screaming
I'll fuck her when she's dead
Knock her out rip her organs
Rip them out tear them out
Knock her out rip her organs
Rip them out tear them out
I slice her belly open
Expose the large intestine
And watch the crimson flow
Strech incision open
Organ harvest appendages from a virgin
As I fuck her I disemboweled desecrate
Organ Harvest wrap her neck with intestines
As I eat her I ejaculate on her heart
Smash the ribs then grab the the lungs rip them out
Murder rape dissection necrophilia
Her ass is still warm as I invade it
I told her I loved her as I jizzed on her liver
My body shaked seizured as I ripped apart my love
In your terror
Whipers in the somber night
Frozen in a voiceless scream
Reflections of your life are senseless
Hoping for a second chance
The dark wind calls your name
ever so gently
Imminent death is here
Cannot be accepted
Fearing your end your life has expired
In your terror
Whispers in the somber night
Out of sight You are
Frozen in a voiceless scream
In your last breath
The dark wind closes in
Your time has come
To leave this pathetic
world of shit of shame
This life that you've chosen
To rebel against
to turn your back on
has repaid you
in full with your life
Dishonor of your family has left you
Frozen in a voiceless scream
I'm killing you motherfucker
Suffer for your deceitfulness
I will not take these things lightly
As you fuck me I will fuck you
You think you are invincible
Fuck with me and you will be dead
You are as good as dead
I am certain of your death
Deep throat my gun
Taste the cold steel
Pull the tigger
you're still alive
Take my hammer upon your bleeding head
Cranium smashed in spilling your blood
Now you will die I'll make sure of it
what can you do you are now dead
Stuffing your corpse into a 55 gallon drum
Entombed in your coffin solidified by cement
As your head sticks out I will smash it in
Your head is now severed stuffed in your tomb

I've been shivering all night long
It's a sheer disaster
A real bastard
It's not even cold
Yet I fire it up somehow
Just as much as I'll allow
Pills accompany the leaf
Satisfy the call
It keeps me down
You keep me down
So keep it down
Hey
Come my way
I'll be damned if I'm refused
Those ain't the words that win me over in my mind
You've got the mystifyflyby wonder juice
I got a ton of curiosity
And though it might just kill the cat
Satisfaction brings him back
Filled above the shotglass line
Satisfy the call
Rise to the stars with a scar because I've paid my dues
Ain't got too much more to lose
I've got a soul to find before my mind can rest yet
Fall to my knees and praise the lucky
Ha lfspeed and lonely
A shelter for the alone
Wheels riding through my days into my nights I curl up with no one
Feeling sometimes I've been bathed by the razor
Lost in a wild touch of illness  cold
I fly higher when I'm down
Restless are the souls that burn for more
Late at night I curl up with no one
You're so damn
Believe  tonight you suffer
Just a matter of time before the line that separates the love and rage divides
Heartbroken
Giving and then some
I've suffered
You've given none
My fingers
my calloused hands
I've suffered
I've given and then some
Still I miss you when you're gone
It's a cold black stolen world
My curtains drawn and then tied
So gifted
Falling behind
How can they justify the confliction
My fist is curled and tight
World of subpar
Stolen world of knaves
Please help before the line divides
Cries of failed allegiance
Got no reason to feed them all the noise
Riding alone
Mistakes never bother you
And brother how it shows
I'm reaching out for more
Reach for more
I feel it burning
I'm never full
Those days long behind
Shattered visions of due supremacy
Stepping on our fingers and our toes
One is thing is certain
No one will ever know
Still I am burning
Still I'm not full
I've got a little selfgenerated hunger
Send it to my fingers and my voice  a roller
I was lost
I should have started long ago
Hard life
Hard like a stone
Freezing cold
Down to the bone
Break from the hold
Those days long behind
Got the feeling my best are left to gain
More dues to pay
No trepidation only focus of liability inside of me
My patience wearing thin
Cleansed of all sin
Or am I causing more
Till the soil
Coming rain quenches thirsty crops again
Laying idle keeps you tired since the growing time expired
I don't know what's come over me
Once I was so scholarly
And now I realize my fate
Time has come to irrigate
Gotta till my soil
Fertilize the plains to keep the brains alive
Suckerfools around
Counted on by those who clearly keep them on the ground
Ground level streetwise pain makes a good man go insane
They taught you well by teaching none
Now you help their business run with your consumer ignorance
Coerner you at no expense
I sometimes wonder who's to blame
Mighty nation falling lame
If you're thirsty for knowledge then drink of the wine
You'll never achieve it if you don't tend the vine
A glimmer of sunlight wrestles the clouds
Calling the rooted seep up from the ground
Driven by will
Not by fear
Driven by will to keep my planet here
Criticize me  I'm taking it back
I am the millions that pay the tax dollars that keep you fat
It's about damn time that we bury your crime
Crimeridden government
Can you hear the message sent
The education has begun
Billions all becoming one
Your faithful flock now bearing teeth
Find your wicked beneath the hooves of all you've made recoil
Earth is for the ones that till the soil
Bathe in the swill of life
Covered by the stench of the trail
Bitter is the one who won't feel change
Cauterize the wounds that the fathers left behind
Because I can't believe the words of the chosen doesn't mean I won't be alright
Spirits rise and take to flight
Galvanize the darkness
Upon my soul render completion
Whole
Render my whole
I'm getting down
I'm feelin' good to go another round
I've got a fistful of broken promises cast to the wind
Will you be yourself again
Another day is gone and if I'd have done it differently
And so it goes falling short of guarantee
I sailed across the sea and I saw the world in another light
I'm coming back to you
Coming back to see you
Feel you touch you taste you
The land is sweet the offerings are good
Take it all I know I should
Should I be leaving here
Once again second guesser fails
The blackness sweeps
Over zealot fairs the same
Gettin' cold by the hour
I was only a child when I first saw their lies
Saw them all
They've got the answers to the problems that cannod be solved
They make the accusations then commit the very fault
I only hope there is a special place for those like you
'Cause if there ain't I'd rather burn in hell alone
Handwriting's on the bathroom wall
Headline is screaming Stand or Fall
I'm beneath the wheels of a motor truck
Takin' none from no one
Your loving's like a fax machine
Sends an image but it isn't real
Blaming others for your bitter pain
Tears they fall like acid rain
You'd better watch yourself
You're gotta push your luck too far and I'll be coming down
Coming down upon you
Ooze from out of nowhere
Back to countrysomewhere should you go and stay
Make it somewhere far away
See your wallflowers as you grip the power of your sacred book
Take another into your crystal ball
Kingdom soon will fall
Then you'll want your mother
Fuck THAT sit man
Moaning in a nightmare
Pain like a shattered tooth
Born of viral tendency can't hear the storming boom of a fired gun
Smackdab in the middle of shit
Bathing in the bowels of hell
Slipping in between the sheets with a happy headed for a rush of orgasmic greed
Hardly in control
Reeling
Hot and cold
Viral tendency
Infectious memory
Falling in a cold mire
Living in a world unknown
Feral lies pawn the sins of eventrival pain becomes your home
Writhing
Soaking head
Visions of the dead
Try to shake it off
Like there waiting for the sun
Rabid
Running with sodden legs
Wild poisonous suffering
Contagion die alone
Lover becomes a bone
Realize consciously oncoming insanity
Strumpet comes again and again
Synthetic copulation ends
Bringer of a gold mine
Bringer of a pile of dung
Every mind a bringer of an aberration of someone else's thought
Nightmares disappear in the dark by the light of day
Spirit of a shallow soul is reconnected with a confused exhausted shell
Reminded of
Here we meet again
Tearing at the mind
As the reflection tests my pride
I've been the guilty the war bringer time and again and again
Believe me my son hell isn't far
God praise her
Heart gazer
Blackout in all the misery
Street angel in the sun
House demon screams for all my love
Countless tears I've cried
Yet I seem to keep them all inside
Rising up into my eyes even with the level of the floodgates
Bound to love I'll never know or show
One too many one too few
God only knows all that I've sacrificed for you
Cursed by living nursing pain
Have mercy on this cross I bear
Give all my wages while my baby's left to fend
My fingers dig for more to send
Then they ever see the light
Twisted visions of what's wrong and what's right
I've seen the light
It's burning in my head
Don't you bother hearing the tongues of evil men
Lies abound the carpets of the deepshag saviors and the goldlined sphincters of the ones who claim they're saved
Something is telling me that the ones they praise they'll never face
do it do it do it do it do it do it do it
do it do it do it do it do it do it do it
do it do it do it do it do it do it do it
do it do it do it do it do it do it do it
Calling out my name I heard you speak
I should not have been so arrogant
Knowing fullwell the consequence I paint you black with sin
Tell me that I am the chosen one
I want to believe you
Pull the knife out of my back as I call you out
Black with sin
Tattoed be fore I had a chance to begin defending my case
A real low
It's what I have to bear
Living day to day under the tag of a blasphemer
Blasphemer
You say I am unholy
I just wanna say my say
You hold me within your caged heart
Torturing
Awestricken you fill my glass again
I must see you drink it first
If I should go down I beg you don't let me drown
List of the skies of the damned
Keep them under command
Hold your head up high
Deep in your lies
Pain of the weak and the frail fighting tooth and nail
Wake up in your jail watching you and your kind take it out on mine
It leaves an aftertaste bitter like a
Flames
Demons burn all the souls that they seem to deem fit
All the while they smile
Smiling through the teeth of a pig
Wretched whore
Trying to get some more
Get you through the door
Fucking all the pigs as your man sorry man eulogized by all takes a final fall
Get you through the door
Now you're on all fours fucking like a whore
Begging for some more
Never heard of love
You say we're victims
I don't buy it
Excuses all are lies
From time to time I lose some power
So goes a day in the life
The frenetic world of a blasphemer
Kill me fast  end the misery
I dare you to let me go
Hands red with my own blood I paint you black with sinI feel her last embrace on me
The final autumn sun
Drownin in a sea of golden spawns
Once away but oh so near
Gathered gloomy clouds
Passin in the sky as golden swans
The morning dew the fallen leaves
The shorter growin days
All I've seen but never from this side
All my dreams that seemed so real
All they passed on by
Sunken in the last October light
And so I lost it  again but forever new
The worlds keeps turning  so do I but without you
And I keep dreamin  as I did since my dreams began
The swans are passing and the joy  in the drowning  sun
The lights of spring the gloom of fall
All it has been real
All it's left this mourning deep inside
And once again the leaves will dwell
The swans then will return
But will I ever see the present light
And so I lost it
Long lost and forgotten you are
Covered by the fallen leaves
The only shelter they bring
To forget what I'll never reach
And so I lost it
I'm standing in a cold flood
When I'm going over the lake of tears
I'm watching the glittering stars of the sunshine
A shadow from the Venuspearl
My everywhere blinding and my phantasies
Let red black flames in me dwell
I will join the red honey
On my lips and on my skin and in me
As I saw the waterbride
Arrived at the gate of helplessness
Standing in this bloody earth in hopeless veils
I cry in the winds and remembrance will dwell
As still the wounds are deep
Abandoned and left alone cursed and acrificed
Driven away by her pride I'll wait
Beyond the doors for a light beyond the doors
In a frozen yet lonely time
Your beauty  and my need
Your looks  and my silence
Your image  and my fear
Your looks for one last time
Your image for one last time
Feeling your kisses on my silent cheeks  just one time
Touching your blossoms just one time
Costing your stream just one time talkin to you
The storm of the seasons destructing me
And my leaves fall to the ground
And I revel in my wounds as I feed
My blood mother earth I'll fall to my knees
In the shadows I'll remain unseen
My misery to mother earth and in loneliness
I'll die insignificant and unconscious in this winter
In a world only I live in
where life's no more worth to live
At the gates I cry for you
So I remain unseen in the shadows in fear
The ivy will grow one with my body
It chains me to your bonds the ivy of fear
I hate disgust mankind and I love
And I'll wait at the gate  as the leaves will fall
To see the light  as the leaves will fall
That we dance in the gardens of heaven  as the leaves
Over the mountain and along the river  as the leaves
Another world without harm  as the leaves
Fallen leaves
Endless sorrow is running from out tearful eyes
Flowin down in many rivers
Turning to one in a neverending stream
On its way down to the wide and endless ocean of tears
The ocean of time lets all remembrance to our crystal dance die
The time of waiting that has changed us
And will separate us forever
Our crystal dance
We've laughed and we've cried
I was young and didn't know
Our crystal dance
In the summer air we've been enchanted
We walked past the ocean of time
Where we walked our separate ways for this oh so endless time
To the ends of this ocean we now have reached
And we cry our endless tears
Our crystal dance
This single summer just we danced our crystal dance
And then we lost each other in the eternity of time
Black crows surround my body
In a bloody occident
Fans surround my spirit
And veils surround the body of my bride
The snow lies cold and the frozen river
Is flowing to the valley of tears
On the bank the bleeding trees
Their blood is spilling away
And a tear is pouring in the stream
Withered flowers covering my bride
My spirit is fallin ill
And our love is runnin over flint fields
The snow whips depression upon the land
Black crows are gathering
Our rhapsody is playin the final song
And the requiem of thy life is coming to an end
I'm standing by thy grave the coffin is lyin
Over the tomb flowing tears fulfill me
You  the rose of my life  you'll fade to black
In a long and cold dark winter night
flowing tears and withered flowers
The coffin is suspended to the tomb
And the tears are pouring on the withered flowers
I'm falling to the ground my tears are droppin
Melting the snow I'll fall in the cold and our flames
Are extinguished as we die as we fade away
Along a dreaming ocean
Coral banks of the eternal desire
Pass away before my eyes
And across I walk so  a romance
The flames of  dream
Cycling dragging the eternal winds
Where some  the worms and sand
The eternal winds gloaming  now
At your feet on carrying sand  color
Along a dreaming ocean
I've been looking for you
To find the island
Your heart is lying on
To find the many 
That I could understand you
The dreams of romance sweetness and desire
A scarlet fire to travel in me
A scarlet's trips a passing my heart
The long hair that lava floods
Dreaming to your pending dress
My  bloody bloody sun
This skin dreaming the color
And so passing myself
And I dream in your arms
And the ocean  someday when
And you're lovely back
 trips
Your hands are combing my hair
When I'm in your arms
I've never understood
Why you doubt trusting my love
And I dream of the red lava floods
At the ocean of the scarlet sun
The beautiful lovely red flames
In your arms
In your arms
In a sorry smile
For all I said
Shall I drown in yours
As once all I hadCome my love we'll leave this here land
I'll take you far by paths no mortal knows
In an emerald garden under newborn stars
And there my love we could be as once before
I'll make you a gown of lilies and pearls
To wear on the day we exchange vows
In an emerald garden under an azure sky
There my dear child we could love as before
He who alone faces thousands
He who stands when all kneel
He who walks where few dare
He whose voice speaks the truth
Is a true man of honor
A spirit unbowed
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart
He who holds virtue sacred
He who loves the Fatherland
He who fights for his people
He who surrenders to none
Is a true man of honor
A spirit unbowed
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart
He whose soul has no price
He whose eyes are not dark
He whose sword brings justice
He whose name is put to song
Is a true man of honor
A spirit unbowed
And in his chest is a'pounding
A warrior's heart
Summer's breeze blowing through their mane
Wild horses of the purest breed Ride
Onward to battle onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed Hail
Spurs to the side a lash of the reins
Foam in the mouth A' glistening the eye
Bloodlust is nigh for a rider and steed
Alike as they ride pressing to the fight
The banners are high and so's the battle cry
The trampling of hooves of the purest breed Ride
Onwards to battle onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed Hail
Spurs to the side a lash of the reins
Foam in the mouth A' glistening the eye
Bloodlust is nigh for a rider and steed
Alike as they ride pressing to the fight
Wild horses of the purest breed
Born to the steppes defiant to the cold
Cozak warriors of the purest breed
Loyal to the Czar they defy death
Summer's breeze blowing through their mane
wild horses of the purest breed Ride
Onward to battle onwards like the wind
Cozak warriors of the purest breed Hail
Father of victory
My life I lay down to thee
Steep me in majesty
And forth send thy Valkyries
Father of victory
My sword I offered unto thee
Crown me for eternity
In Valhalla now welcome me
Father of victory
Behold Your true son am i
As einherjer I stand
In your honor for to fight
Father of victory
Thou who reigns supreme
Ride wild a hunting
O'er fires on the battlefield
In the days of yore
The royal hunt was on
As Gediminas set forth
In the holy woods
Of old Sventaragis
He laid down to rest
Beneath an ancient oak
And dreamt as only dream
The men who would be kings
He saw the iron wolf
Rise monstrous on the hill
He heard the iron wolf
Howl like hundreds of its kin
Tearing from the veils of sleep
His hear was a wild drumbeat
He sought the counsel of the Gods
Through Lizdeika's wise words
What is destined for thee let it be
Great Duke unite thy people and be king
Fear not the iron wolf
He shall be thy fort
And in him shall dwell
All the rulers of thy line
And the glory of their deeds
Shall resound like wolfsong
Thoughout the ancient world
No paler a star than Luna herself
Arose beside Venus when night settled in
The eye of the heavens o'er Hastings beholds
The Norman and the Saxon lying side by side
Drenched in red blood still clinging to their swords
They fought for the dominion of Albion's lands
Yet who proved the strongest hardly a man can tell
Whose God prevailed Christ or the Old Faith
The days shall come the nights shall pass
And the grass will grow on the mounds alas
The wind laments across Hastings' vale
It still remembers the sound of swords being crossed
The poignant yells the sound of fury the fire and the blood
And though centuries may pass
And tall on Hastings grow the grass
Remember that terrible day of swords
Remember the warriors whose lives were lost
Remember Hastings and shed a tear for it's ghost
Stars a' glimmer in a valley sheer
Steel is drawn and shines in moonlight
The heavens quake then pour heavy rain
Thunders announce the bloody battle's eve
The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am
Dare stand in my path
We crossed the sea in a dragonship
We braved the fury of the waves
We've come here for war we bring woe
Fires that shall burn high and rise to the sky
Odin ride forever by our side
Thy will is grim but it will be done
Tyr embrace in thy might your sons
Freyja weave thy spell of magic
The wheel of the sun is carved on my shield
And so are the runes of Thor on my sword
Odin's blood has blessed my spear
Invincible I am
Dare stand in my path
Oft I have seen
Many a brilliant star to fade
And night came creeping in to usurp that once shinning place Long ago I was
a mariner
A viking conqueror I sailed far with Erik the Red
And a hundred brave men
What glory remains
Of these ancient days
What songs will be sung
In the days to come
Under hostile skies I have slept
On the heardrest of the sword
And dreamt of past glories long
Now gone forevermore
I saw the fire that burns within
The mystic caverns of Thule
I journeyed to a world forlorn
Where shades weep forevermore
Blackened by dragon's breath
Under arrows I have dreamt
Of the billows that caress
The shores of home again and again
What glory remains
Of the ancient days
What songs will be sung
in the days and years to come
Alas
I've grown too old
And my days are numbered
I neither have the strength
Nor fire that I once did
Following Avon's crystal path
I pass'd by Warwick by chance
Where I came across a mansion
Standing gauntly on a low bluff
He was brave and he was bold
He was in love with the daughter of his lord
She would not have him
She would not care
So he went afar to win her hand
Germania's rose he set free
And put Saracens to the sword
He laid low monstrous beasts
Yet love he did not win
He faced the Danes
And saved the dayKing Athelstan
Did praise his name
But bereft of love
He turned to god
And shut himself away from men
Then I awoke and realized
I had slept in his deathbed
Charles Martel the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge
Charles Martel in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy bloodred
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all
Ans when the sound of battle horns
Shall keenly fill the air anon
We'll rise with pride our banner high
And answer to our king's call
Charles Martel the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge
Charles Martel in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy bloodred
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all
Even when the horns of war
Shall echo in the fields no more
When in tatters hangs our flag
And empty be the throne of Franks
We'll still keep watch by night to see
Charles Marterl return again
Rest now my king but light be thy sleep
Thy foes still covet thy crown
Charles Martel the day will come again
I'll see you lead the cavalry to charge
Charles Martel in the battle of Ambleve
You dyed Malmedy bloodred
Tours recall the glory of your hosts
Thy fame is sung on harps with golden strings
The crescent moon you drove back to the sea
Once and for all
The cock crew in the morning
I arose and went to the fields
Holding but a handful of seeds
First I did sow then I did plough
I prayed for rain to come down
I prayed to Thor to burden the clouds
I looked up with hopes of a sky
Heavy impregnated by a storm
That would bring to life once more
My last handful of seeds
I dreamt of the barely rich on the fields
Would that I had a scythe
To reap all day long and then some more
So as I could keep my storehouse filled
And put bread and ale upon my table
Pray the Gods hear me
Pray the wind bears my plea afar
To the fields on high
Where immortals turn the soil
And blessings ripen like fruit
On the trees that guards vigilant
The fragrant orchards of Freyja
 Do angels fly higher in the dark
Black is my mind when a new day has come
Black are the tears when I cry
Come here and take my hand join this misery
The fallen angel set us free
Do angels fly higher in the dark
Do they crash down and fall apart
Let's cut the wings away
and the angel has fallen again
Together in eternal flames
Where the cold razor cares
I do not care if you want to hurt me
Torture is ecstasy to me
You cut my wounds so deep even deeper than your's
Like fallen angel without remorse
Yeah
The only hope in this endless night
Is to follow you through the shadows of the deepest blue away from the light
I hear your voice is calling me Don't be afraid
But there's something deep inside of me
Forcing me to turn away
Take my hand don't turn away I need you to stay
I know a place where the light and the dark can become as one
This loneliness is killing me
Is there a place we both can live
You're the dancer in the dark
You're the child of the light
You're the sinner of all time
You're the saint with wings so white
You're the distant shape in the night
You're all the innocence left alive
You're like tainted sun
You're the star shining bright
Too many broken promises in her fragile life
Too many secret thoughts she tried to hide that night
So hard she tried to escape
But the pain was everywhere
No take this pain away
Even for one day
She cried on her own grave
Please demons set me free
My heart has started to bleed
I have become the queen misery
And it seems to last forever
She tried to reach to the stars all her life
But her mind fell apart every time
Lost in your dark eyes
I have seen your shadow world
Moments of madness
Slowly drowning in your love
I promise you nothing
But this earthly misery
Would you share it with me
High much higher than moon
Flies away the angel of love
Deep much deeper and true
Is the sea of emotions we share
The poem so beautiful
Can turn into nightmare before we know
The secret bound of our blood oath
Keeps us together until the dawn
The crestfallen one
Drowned in to lies
Your promises in beautiful disguise
I see it from your eyes
The sweetest demise
The flame of you life so sweet sacrifice
This is the game you want me to join in
It is you your world there's nothing to believe in
The rapture of lust
The ruins of my trust
I will take your heart because you took mine
It's written in my mind
Painted in my heart
Temptation nearly tears up my scars
The mirror never lies
See the eyes of despise
You raped my dreams so I will take you down
Another broken day passed by
Another dead night is waiting to come alive
You are already trying to find
One more way to hide from the burning light
You don't want to see
You don't want to feel
Nothing but your hopeless destiny
You can always cry but never complain
All those bitter tears will it ease the pain
It's Part of the crying game will it ease the pain
When everything should be fine
I still found you depressed and crying all the time
It seems to me that you want to feel like you're dying
Kiss the darkness and turn you back to the light
You don't want to see
You don't want to feel
Nothing but your hopeless destiny
You can always cry but never complain
All those bitter tears will it ease the pain
It's Part of the crying game will it ease the pain
Even when the dead nights are gone those broken days remain
All those bitter tears will it ease the pain
It's Part of the crying game will it ease the pain
You threw your web right down on me
You suck my blood just to live
You're the black princess in the garden of grief
Eating me piece by piece
To be with you is like mouth full of spiders
Like needles under my skin
To sleep with you is like a bed filled by snakes
Something I can't resist
Oh licking your bloody lips
Smiling and sucking your fingertips
Oh lash me with your whip
I'm your slave My dear carniwhore
You're the cocaine on my filthy mirror
Oh my god how I need you
Living in fear to be left alone
My lips turn to blue
I'm like a sheep among the hungry wolves
This is my sorrow blues
You're the poison in my veins
I'm just a fool in your game
In the prison of my own frontiers
Loneliness is my worst fear
Blinded by your heavenly smile
And my soul is the price
Oh licking your bloody lips
Smiling and sucking your fingertips
Oh lash me with your whip
I'm your slave for you I bleed
Is this love hate or pain
For me it's all the same
These are the last words I say
Because I really don't care
If you will come with me in there
Where the sun never shines
Oh would you share this world with me
Oh nothing compares to this beautiful dream
Make love with me
On the bed of dead leaves
Through the anguish and filth
Together we wander
In the sea of your tears so come with me
And the torment will be complete
If you will come with me in there
Where the sun never shines
The touch of fall has reached us again
Our hearts are covered by the endless rain
Accept our fate don't say anything
I'll hold until we fade away
The whole world turns to grey
We are fading away from this life
You and me we will be
Part of the autumn harmony
Together sleeping the endless dream
You and me we will be
Gone in the wind of eternity
Together sleeping the endless dream
All the colors turn to grey
Everything dies to be born again
There's no need to be afraid
I'll hold until we fade away
A broken voice from the broken dreams
My heart is drowning in loveblood
I can't forget your leaving shape
Everyday is like a long walk in the cold rain
I'm bleeding and loosing my grip
Tomorrow is a closed gate
I have been dead for so long
And no one's gonna shed a tear
I have been dead for so long
And no one seems to care
Sometimes I really hate people close to me
They want to see my reaction
That I don't want to give
Sometimes I really want to be just dead
Without any kind of
Torturing stress
I wrote it in the dead air I wrote it in the shape of despair
I see the silence in the stranger's smiles
They don't care
Memories in the screams of the gate my past slowly fades
Questions are stones on my way
I'm still walking anyway
 Do angels fly higher in the dark
Black is my mind when a new day has come
Black are the tears when I cry
Come here and take my hand join this misery
The fallen angel set us free
Do angels fly higher in the dark
Do they crash down and fall apart
Let's cut the wings away
and the angel has fallen again
Together in eternal flames
Where the cold razor cares
I do not care if you want to hurt me
Torture is ecstasy to me
You cut my wounds so deep even deeper than your's
Like fallen angel without remorse
Yeah
The only hope in this endless night
Is to follow you through the shadows of the deepest blue away from the light
I hear your voice is calling me Don't be afraid
But there's something deep inside of me
Forcing me to turn away
Take my hand don't turn away I need you to stay

All those bitter tears will it ease the pain
It's Part of the crying game will it ease the pain
You threw your web right down on me
You suck my blood just to live
You're the black princess in the garden of grief
Eating me piece by piece
To be with you is like mouth full of spiders
Like needles under my skin
To sleep with you is like a bed filled by snakes
Something I can't resist
Oh licking your bloody lips
Smiling and sucking your fingertips
Oh lash me with your whip
I'm your slave My dear carniwhore
You're the cocaine on my filthy mirror
Oh my god how I need you
Living in fear to be left alone
My lips turn to blue
I'm like a sheep among the hungry wolves
This is my sorrow blues
You're the poison in my veins
I'm just a fool in your game
In the prison of my own frontiers
Loneliness is my worst fear
Blinded by your heavenly smile
And my soul is the price
Oh licking your bloody lips
Smiling and sucking your fingertips
Oh lash me with your whip
I'm your slave for you I bleed
Is this love hate or pain
For me it's all the same
These are the last words I say
Because I really don't care
If you will come with me in there
Where the sun never shines
Oh would you share this world with me
Oh nothing compares to this beautiful dream
Make love with me
On the bed of dead leaves
Through the anguish and filth
Together we wander
In the sea of your tears so come with me
And the torment will be complete
If you will come with me in there
Where the sun never shines
The touch of fall has reached us again
Our hearts are covered by the endless rain
Accept our fate don't say anything
I'll hold until we fade away
The whole world turns to grey
We are fading away from this life
You and me we will be
Part of the autumn harmony
Together sleeping the endless dream
You and me we will be
Gone in the wind of eternity
Together sleeping the endless dream
All the colors turn to grey
Everything dies to be born again
There's no need to be afraid
I'll hold until we fade away
A broken voice from the broken dreams
My heart is drowning in loveblood
I can't forget your leaving shape
Everyday is like a long walk in the cold rain
I'm bleeding and loosing my grip
Tomorrow is a closed gate
I have been dead for so long
And no one's gonna shed a tear
I have been dead for so long
And no one seems to care
Sometimes I really hate people close to me
They want to see my reaction
That I don't want to give
Sometimes I really want to be just dead
Without any kind of
Torturing stress
I wrote it in the dead air I wrote it in the shape of despair
I see the silence in the stranger's smiles
They don't care
Memories in the screams of the gate my past slowly fades
Questions are stones on my way
I'm still walking anywayBreathing in and out as they point to the man as he lays a gun in his hand
Looking through the window at him no sign of breathing Breathing
Running around I'm running around again Back and forth back and forth
I'm breathing In and out in and out again and again
Running around I'm running around again Back and forth back and forth
I'm breathing Breathing
And in this dream I had of you if I could say one thing to you
Our dreams won't die They'll never go away
I find myself reaching backwards for him No sign of breathing
Looking through the window at him at him
For the promises you've made and all the lies you've portrayed
Forever in those eyes
Hopefully you will find what your looking for and maybe someday you can realize that the pain only holds so deep
In this moment in this day we will hopefully find underneath all the lies and somehow find our way and somehow find our way
Our dreams won't die
Your whole world has been torn apart from the start
Your whole world your whole world
You're in my heart and in my head
in my head
A plethora of things that need to be said
needs to be said
Does it make it alright to wish that you're dead
wish that you're dead
I feel it's unsaid Feelings unsaid
feelings unsaid
No one would care no one would risk a thing for you
This is swear my dear I fear it's true
No one would care no one would risk a thing for you
No one would care no one would risk a thing for you
no one cares
No one would care no one would risk a thing for you
no one cares for
You
Your whole world has been torn apart from the start
Your whole world your whole world
You're in my heart and in my head
in my head
A plethora of things that need to be said
needs to be said
Does it make it alright to wish that you're dead
wish that you're dead
I feel it's unsaid Feelings unsaid
feelings unsaid
Go
I can see and feel it again it's taking me away
I don't know what else to say but I know have said
I can see and feel it again I can see and feel it again
I can see and feel it again it's taking me away
I can see and feel it again I can see and feel it again
I can see and feel it again
You'll blame yourself for this
Looking back on what once was we don't exist
Not knowing if everything will be just fine
Will everything be alright
I won't fear tonight
For we will rid ourselves from all of this
And tear our thoughts limb from limb
A nightmare reaction
There's nothing left of this
A feeling you can't resist
The times you spent sleeping
Are more or less just a daydream
And when you find yourself at ease
You never will be you never will be
And when you find yourself at ease
You never will be
The times you spent sleeping
Are more or less just a daydream
You blame yourself for this
Looking back on what once was
You blame yourself for this
We don't exist
I won't let this go
For some things you will never know
This is who I am who I am
You will never know
And when you find yourself at ease
You never will be you never will be
And when you find yourself at ease
You never will be
The times you spent sleeping
Are more or less just a daydream
I won't let this go
Recognize the lights set in front of your demon's eyes
And the path that we've paved
Realize that the only thing standing between you and me
Is the tomb and the grave
We will rot as the sun comes up
We will rot as the sun comes over the
As it's time dig the grave
Show us how only time will tell
In this phase of you and me
We will find a medium of reality of reality
December everyday
We will rot as the sun comes up
We will rot as the sun comes over the
This is what I get for helping my friends
And friends before family makes it a tragedy
So what if I can protect myself
From the lies that separates us from the outside
That separates us from the inside
That separates us from the outside
Recognize the lights set in front of your demon's eyes
And the path that we've paved
Realize that the only thing standing between you and me
Is the tomb and the grave
Never coming back is this what I deserve
Found in the flood
Drowning in mud
Washing away all the things in my life
Manipulating and separating
Is this what you will do from the things that you choose
From the things that you lose
nothing ever happens to you
If I had said to your face your fucking face
your cowardly facebow down
All this time you've made nothing of yourself
For what it's worth having said this before
Your loosing from choosing with no remorse
The things you say along
the way will help resent your destiny
Is this what you will do from the things you choose
From the things that you lose
nothing ever happens to you
You said this to my face my fucking face
You choose to ignore the things I say
What I sayif I had said to your face
Your disgrace
Make something of yourself or search for someone else who makes you feel real
Whoever thought that I could feel like this
Pull back your mask and show us all who you really are
How can you live like this pretending everythings fine
It's not alright Your not alright Find yourself
So this is what we've come to
Life is what you make of it
So find something to hold on to
I've practically gave up on this
How can someone feel like this is the end
Don't hold your breath in my life
Tell yourself Ask yourself Am I alright
Sinking flailing and fighting for air doesn't mean your alone
There is someone else out there who will pull you down
How can you live with yourself
So this is what we've come to
Life is what you make of it
So find something to hold on to
I've practically gave up on this
I have run from myself Mirrors show nothing but somebody else
Life is what you make of it
Life
I know I've got to
Once more I watch you
Spinning around falling down
There's nothing left of you
This is the end for now I pray
Bring it back then take it all away
My feelings are now on the line
I haven't felt so far behind
She lead my ghost to shallow water
Nothing but respect only with respect
As I lay with regret nothing but regret so I repent
Every now and then I take a look at all the pictures
That you've sent me and all the letters
Hoping your better
Before I regret you'll never remember me remember
You will never be the same
Every now and then I take a look at all the pictures
That you've sent me and all the letters
Hoping your better
Before I regret this will never be
Will you remember me
Don't change the way we are
Still opening up for the scars
Let's not rehash what once was
We're falling further down the spiral into denial
It makes no sense nevertheless you won't get the best
You won't get the best
You won't get the best of me
Time and time again you've realized
that hope is far from over
It was never over
Pain that you have gone through
makes you a stronger person
A better person
Pain that you hold close when others know
and all the hate you hold inside
Just open up
Pain that you hold close
and the hate you bottle up inside
We're falling further down the spiral into denial
It makes no sense
nevertheless you won't get the best
You won't get the best
The best of me
Believe in me for goodness sake for goodness sake
The trust that you take the trust that you ache
The love that you hate holding fear as you fate
The movement you make the lies that you take
The love that you hate
Believe Believe is seeing just shut your eyes
Repeat Nothing comes easy
Remembering that look in your eyes I swear I saw you
With my back against the wall
I wish I knew you from before from before
With my back against the wall
I wish I knew you from before let's make no mistakes
When you say those words mean forever
Make no mistake you make no mistakes
Somehow I feel you truly meant never
With chances I take you were my mistake
When you say forever forever is too long
When you say never I believe you
Believing is seeing
When you left behind all the selfish things that you loved
You made the pain go away for the timebeing
For the timebeing
I'll make for sure I count the days of when
You'll be leaving from this earth
I'll make for sure I count the days of when
You'll be leaving from this pain
There's one thing you should know about me
And if you decide to go then leave
There's one thing you should know about me
And if you decide to leave then go
You cry yourself to sleep when
You think no one's watching you
And you have no reaction no pain no loss
You make for sure no one's laughing
You make for sure
You make for sure no one's laughing
One thing's for sure
I still have a fight in me
All the selfish things you loved were all left behind
So hold your head up high and show yourself
What it means to be alive
Show yourself what it truly means not to be alone
Truly meansWhen the fiends have come there is nowhere to hide
I must swing my axe my brothers at my side
Feeding on our own fear passions running high
Fleeing not a choice better to fight and die
In the shieldwall we stand to defend our land
Holding on till the end
Brace the storm and keep the shining blades at bay
Fight to let our kingdom live another day
Heed the old ones' cries we mustn't let them down
We will slaughter them to keep them from the crown
In the shieldwall we stand to defend our land
Holding on till the end
Flanas geseca me
Ecga beata me
Beornas wielda me
Cyningas sind genered urh me
Iren gewunda me
W pen deria me
Cempa teora me
Cynedom is gewered urh me
In the shieldwall we stand to defend our land
Holding on till the end
Our hearts lie not in heaven
Nor eastern desert sands
With eyes closed to your saviour
Our fate is in our hands
Great glass eyes look down on me
So lofty and so great
In your world we are filth
Toys of your lord to dominate
High spires reach for Thunor's sky
A misfit court of stone
Like flame upon the water
It stands there all alone
You say our ways are evil
That devil's seed we sow
Yet we have greater wisdom
Than you will ever know
Your lodging here is ended
Your welcome here is ceased
No honour left bestowed
Our open hand now iron fist
Ours is the Kingdom
On land up high on sea
n jest we let you play
But now's our time for victory
The storm is ever brewing
A power rising fast
Lightning strikes our veins
As we see the bridge at last
As we ride the endless
The truths seem only lies
The few that faced the fire
Honoured as the kings
Now we ride the deathless
Our kingdom has returned
Of fallen kings and heroes
Our children now have learned
Your lodging here is ended
Your welcome here is ceased
No honour left bestowed
Our open hand now iron fist
Ours is the Kingdom
And this we proudly hail
Your teachings have no truth
Our heathen land will now prevail
When Offa spilled Myrging blood we were proud
When Hengest routed the wealas we were proud
When Penda withstood the cross we were proud
When Alfred stayed the Danes we were proud
Heroes passed unto ye we give hail
Mighty men without fear without shame
Some will say that our pride is a sin
But in their name we'll unite and we're proud to be proud
When victory was won at Brunanburh we were proud
When Byrhtnoth raised his sword we were proud
When Harold destroyed Hardrada we were proud
When Hereward defied the bastard we were proud
Heroes passed unto ye we give hail
Mighty men without fear without shame
Some will say that our pride is a sin
But in their name we'll unite and we're proud to be proud
Slowly with time the past slips away
But deep in our souls their memory stays
Weapons of guilt won't conquer our minds
Just strengthen our will to defy
The ignorant void ever opening wide
But we keep their names and spirits alive
Arrows of fear won't pierce our minds
Just strengthen our will to defy
Heroes passed unto ye we give hail
Mighty men without fear without shame
Some will say that our pride is a sin
But in their name we'll unite and we're proud to be proud
Papal banner cross bears the red of the blood we shed
Gave his blessing leaving the heart of the nation dead
Ancient sunwheel stolen and warped for a demigod
Raised in our name you will worship what you hate and fought
Sign of conquest buries the past in the centuries
Beast in slumber lurks in their deepest and darkest fears
Restless dragon guarding the horde of our destiny
Fuck your standard watch in despair as we're breaking free
Show them our sign raise it up high
Banish their symbol of conquest
Tear it to shreds burn it to ash
Throw of the weight of enslavement
Open your souls to our mark of old
Don't let the false one deceive you
Now is the time we shall rule again
Bring down the cross that subdued you
The Golden Dragon flying high again
Dragon slayer so goes the myth and the history
With sword he severed cut us adrift from our unity
Drifting wondering what is amiss what it means to be
Raise the dragon find the answer to the mystery
Show them our sign raise it up high Banish their symbol of conquest Tear
It to shreds burn it to ash
Throw of the weight of enslavement
Open your souls to our mark of old
Don't let the false one deceive you
Now is the time we shall rule again
Bring down the cross that subdued you
The Golden Dragon flying high again
Falling towers of stone smashed by fate
The giants' craft declines undermined by age
Once shining and strong with celebration of men
Until the mighty one swept them away
Their warriors destroyed with war the times of affliction came
Their shining realms in ruin deserted and decayed
Where bold proudhearted men looked on riches bright
Behold the power of fate at this crumbling site
The earth's grip holds as eras pass
We took what we wanted and claimed it as ours
Many a storm these shadow kingdoms have seen
Grey with lichen stained with blood and misery
Once they looked on riches possessions precious stones
Everything must die all that's left is echoes
Legends fading day by day cracks are gaping wide
Till mighty fate will sweep away their ancient work and pride
Their warriors destroyed with war the times of affliction came
Their shining realms in ruin deserted and decayed
Where bold proudhearted men looked on riches bright
Behold the power of fate at this crumbling site
The earth's grip holds as eras pass
We took what we wanted and claimed it as ours
Many a storm these shadow kingdoms have seen
Grey with lichen stained with blood and misery
Across the flood to eastern shore
Riding the wind steady with oar
Forty strong fifteen score
They come upon the eastern shore
From beyond we sailed the sea
Seeking new prosperity
We came for the victory
On the fields we cut them down
Stole their pride and burned their towns
These lands held our destiny
Routed and shamed to the mountains they fled
Soundly defeated they sadly abandoned their homes
A new force had arrived to remain
Covered with glory we conquered and settled our land  Englaland
From foreign soil they saw us come
They new the fight could not be won
We offered them no mercy
Ruthlessly they felt our might
In fear they ran into the night
We shattered their dignity
Routed and shamed to the mountains they fled
Soundly defeated they sadly abandoned their homes
A new force had arrived to remain
Covered with glory we conquered and settled our land  Englaland
A withering flower without its roots
Sadly passing away unloved
Songs to sing and tales to tell
Vanishing into obscurity
A dwindling power bereft of soul
Quietly leaving the world behind
Names to praise and sacred sites
Drifting away to nothingness
But we'll resist until the end
Till the last of us shall fall
And we will love you to the end
Our folk that time forgot
A withering flower without its roots
Sadly passing away unloved
Songs to sing and tales to tell
Vanishing into obscurity
But we'll resist until the end
Till the last of us shall fall
And we will love you to the end
Our folk that time forgot
Wise are the weavers who carry our destiny
Golden threads are the tales of our lives
Worlds entwining a journey eternally
All as one are the earth and the skies
Three are the goddesses pillars of wisdom
Spinners of what is what has and will be
There is no escaping the web
You cannot defy them you cannot break free
Enter the world and the sisters are with you
An energy knot in the fabric of time
To rulers of gods death's the debt we must pay
For creating the pattern of our life's design
Few are the shamans who look upon everything
For this great gift sacrifice they must pay
They will know our choice at the crossroad
The strings of the universe will lead the way
Neverending river flowing
Threads of time unfold
Now is the time to the battle we go
The enemy's waiting much blood will soon flow
But fear ye not death no such honour so high
To fight with your brothers and die
Think not of failure and be strong of mind
Remember our women and bairns left behind
Dawn is now breaking be ready to fight
We'll feast our triumph tonight
For our kin we must win
Never stop struggling
Never give in
Show them our might
Show them our pride
Our culture and creed confined to history
Such a sad tale to tell so my warriors keep marching on
The sun is now rising the birds are in song
Set thoughts of your families spur you along
Smiling they'll greet you a hero's return
Fame and renown to be earned
Gather your weapons lock pity away
We shall be drinking as night follows day
Boasting of victory praising our dead
And glorious times that lay ahead
For our kin we must win
Never stop struggling
Never give in
Show them our might
Show them our pride
Our culture and creed confined to history
Such a sad tale to tell so my warriors keep marching on
Wyrd has woven our path now a tyrant rules our land
A beheaded people we are our power in a dark one's hand
A final hope remains for those with the will to resist
To rally behind his name and defy the bastard's rule
The joy of a battle won like lightning swept away
Our kingdom seized by those with the serpent's eye
Rebel of the marshlands banished to the shade
Defender of our honour a prisoner of time
Forgotten freedom fighter outlaw of the fens
The spirit of the warder shall rise in us again
For centuries roaming among these beams
My ghostly voice haunting and whistling through the trees
Rarely seen but always my presence felt
A lonely soul trapped between life and death condemned to dwell
In this wood my spirit shall stay
Until time will take this forest away
A man of war wearied and battlestained
Then came my fate by an arrow felled but here remained
A sorry heart my thoughts my only friend
Wandering on and I fear my pain will never end
Some say they've seen me floating from tree to tree
Hooded and clad in green shrouded in mystery
Some say they've heard me singing my mournful song
Crying for anyone to set my spirit free
In this wood my spirit shall stay
Until time will take this forest away

We strike
into the heart of God
As we enter the valley from the North for what the besieged perceive as a 
full frontal attack the foul deception goes undetected
The hammer from the South heavy horse four thousand strong  swing down 
upon the anvil of the foot
Dread lords circle above driving fear deep into their hearts
In an orgy of violence the defenders are struck fell in terror their 
weapons thrown down
Thus the gates are thrown open
The city sacked the glory and spoils ravaged the man hacked their piled 
heads bare silent silent witness to the rape of woman and children 
lamentation for the dead a victory song to our ears
Let nothing stand Burn it all a pyre unto the Heavens a warning from our 
Dark Lord Let this place be burnt from memory forgotten unholy sulfured 
and salted ground

open wounds speak to me
in forgotten tongues
Whispering secrets
mysteries of blood and cum
Lavished in moribund

Darkest passions

the pulling of teeth
licking of the meat
Your cries are useless

No begging will help you
my heart is dead and cold
For your betrayal
I consume your soul
Prisoner of my lesh
I return to hell
The Valkyries Weep for me
above this battle*eld
Once they sang of my deeds
now they sing my lament
Just out of their reach
bleeding I lie waiting for death
The warriors way duty met
miles from mercy
bloodied and bent
A cold wind blows
The Hunter has risen
The Deceiver runs with the wolves
over the nations of men
Thy Serpent comes
His will be done on earth
Blacken the heavens
Devour all the remains
Devour
The dark one calls
scream in our veins
Our blood burns with rage
to strike out as did Cain
A cold wind blows
The Hunter has risen
The Deceiver runs with the wolves
over the nations of men
The Valkyries Weep for me
Broken and Betrayed
Once they sang of my deeds
now they sing my lament
Sons of Cain
Sons of Cain
Gaze with me now
as I enchant your eyes
Outside your borders
Beyond the realm of sight
Float with me through the ether
to the edge of the unseen world
Here at the edge of twilight
the crest of oblivion unfolds
Slaves to the horn arise
Undead conquerors unite
Behold they are gathered
The Mighty await the call
The armies of Darkness
Before them you shall fall
fall
Let the call gather the conquerors of Armageddon
Let the cleansing and blood low again
Let the blood low again
with the call
they take wing
Armed with disease and woe
the king of jews shall fall
Fall
Fall
Lumen Nature Passes through
Rise up with thy Arms
Time of Eternal Blackness

Bloodied and broken the meek lift thine eyes
from the ashes only the dead hear their cries
God why have you forsaken me
Loa Shadow of Horroris risen
Take meI welcome oblivion
I beg your most blessed blessed suffering
What Demon hath formed this void
'tis I the prideful one
I broke the seals
A Shriek ran through Eternity
like fear itself
This Darkness swirls all around
This Blackness calls to me
It whispers my secret name
I remember now as blood fell from the sky
We walked among the fields charred skulls
My mother and me my mother Death
As a boy I fed from her withered breast
Moonlit night suckling beneath her blackened wings
Thus she spoke to me
The end of days is nigh my Son
In a voice like breaking bones
Your will be the way
Your will shall be done Destroyer Destroyer
An endless silent void your shrine unto me
I bendI bowI prostrate
I offer my life to thee I beg your silent grace
Spread your wings let us embrace
My very blood screams for your touch
this my darkest deed
Agonies bastard son
Darkest angel of suffering smiles
Destroyer of worlds
Betrayer of hope
Do you know me Ye I have come
I have become Death I am Death
Do you know me Ye I have come
I havebecome Death I am DeathThat story cross the threshold
The scenes go back to my mind
He inspires respect
In that town
He's a priest and she's his wife
Me a poor girl who lives in their house
I clean their home and warm his bed up
Dickhead
Leave me alone
Don't get my skin dirty
Dickhead
Let me go
I won't talk to anyone
I feel hate when he touches me
Only I'm sixteen
He's stealing my life
He sits down near me
While his wife is watching TV
When her glance is far away
He plays with his hand under my skirt
It's my truth
It's my chance
The end of a nightmare
Take a car now
Park it near his home
Two shoots and fire in their house
From your dark side to the eternity
There's only a way
And it's close to you
Choose your cards
And play your aces
It's not a guessing game
Say goodbye
When your bones become dust
And your soul doesn't find a reason for lust
Say goodbye
When your body's plenty of bugs
And you know what is the meaning of distrust
From the other side to our absurdities
From your dark side to our absurdities
There's only a word
I'm not near you
Try Understanding
Why you never said to her
You lost this guessing game
Now I watch the life from my tomb
You sometimes cry on my grave
Keep on pretending that is all right
my life is destroyed again
From your dark side to the eternity
There's only a way
And it's close to you
Choose your cards
And play your aces
It's not a guessing game
You understand it
You know my secrets
Come on Come on
An email burns my soul
We wanna cross the line
You cast a spell on me
Our passion's online
You come get undressed
Your silence leads me on
You're trying to control my mind
Do you want to be my teacher
Don't stop
You undress my body while I
Lick your secrets
We're killing our loveliness
We need to feel alive
Turn on your web cam
I feel you're hot
I see you are so hard
I need your passion now
You never stop
Tonight we were two lovers searching sex
Tonight you'll be all for me I need you in me
My baby touch my body
SlowlySlowly
Kiss my lips you never stop
I'm so hot I can't control Fuck me
Tomorrow we will have to forget
That was OK our contract's at an end
Last night didn't exist
Come on Come on
The breeze of her freedom
She loved by mistake
Kissing her dreams
He took her wisdom
She loved him in the afterlife
And he took her life
She loved by mistake and now she must die
Kristin AIDS in a bed spends her time
Kristin's eyes swallow her last sweet tears
Nobody cares her  in her sorrow 
Alone she cries  in the dark 
Kristin AIDS she dreamt of escaping
She felt her life
She loved by mistake
and now she must die
She lost her friends
She loved by mistake
and now she must die
The things she lost in a dream
which left her alone
She loved by mistake
and now she must die
In her funeral Only two girls asked
who was she Nobody knew the answer
Don't try to find her
No more blame
if everyday promises died again
No more prays
if everyday our game's the same
I need your warm close to me
I wanna dream to night as well
Should we have chosen once again
another final
You need my hand close to you
You wanna listen my silence again
Should we have chosen our losing dreams
or another fantasy
Oh oh ooh ooh oh oh
Waiting the time of our end
Don't miss my words
if daylight is getting close
Don't take my love
if everyday you must go
Don't miss the voice
We will be close
Don't be ashamed
or we will be lost
Do you need to be yourself
Don't you want to understand it
Did you round your story out
by yourself
At Night the phone rings  I listened 
a sweet voice whispers his name
His face changes and he goes out
he follows a dream
While I'm on my own
And I expected to go on
Our Story
I remember it in my dreams
I'm a dreamer
I missed someone
There was no one
I can't understand it
At school I seek your glance
I get it
Without you the world is different
I thought about a new life
or my suicide
There's no solution
The end of a song
You want to make  your last effort 
Leaves fall off
you go for that street
Without knowing your way
Before she dies
she gave a box
with her last kiss
He lost his dreams
he would keep it
He wanted that kiss
Mar come back to me I can't live
it doesn't make sense
Mar I wrote something
for you our last night
before you die
Mar I want to die
I can't live
I miss your voice
You feel alone
you are strong
but there's nothing wrong
They don't understand
you wear dark clothes
or die for her
He feels so empty
when he looks at her grave
The rain blurs his tears
She was so far from him
There were many things
that he never said to her
He opened the box
and she gave her last kiss
Mar come back to me I can't live
it doesn't make sense
Mar I wrote something
for you our last night
before you die
Mar no te vayas
vuelve conmigo
Te pido que no te vayas
Mar vuelve a mi
quiero morir
Lloré en su tumba
In 1817 a courting couple
by the sea
He promised her
he would return
While the time won the battle
His lips caressed her skin
when tomorrow
they'll say good bye
She closed her sweet eyes
but he wasn't there
I
n 1817 that sea
which united us
separated us
In 1870 an old woman
cried at the beach
She was waiting
for that sea
returned her lover
once again
The children shouted crazy
at her
She wore a wedding dress
when she threw herself
into the water
The legend tells that night
people saw two lovers
dancing at the sea between
foam and coral
Je vivais par toi
Mes jours mes nuits
rien que pour toi
Quand tu étais là
Ma vie s'est illuminée

Tu m'as oubliée
Mon Coeur est brisé
Je ne sais plus quol faire
Je ne suis plus qu'une ombre
Enfermée dans ma peur
Je ne suis plus qu'une ombre
Je suis noyée dans ma peur
ma peur du lendemain
Ces eaux sont si sombres
Je suis noyée dans ma peur
ma peur de I'ncertain
Ces eaux sont si sombres
Je ne peux plus rester là
je dois trouver un chemin
Je croyais en toi
J'aurais pu mourir
dans tes bras
Quand tu étais là
Tes mots
ta voix me rassuraint
Tu disais m'aimer

Summer is at an end
The sorrow was
in their hearts
Thousands of promises
When they were separated
Time is too slow
When you're not close to me
We'll never forget
my love that summer
My girl You're my girl
Too late it's too late
When I'll be able to look
at those eyes
I said as we said
Too late It's too late
I'm looking forward to
feeling your lips
I don't believe you
I want you to explain me
I need to know everything
I don't believe you
I want you to explain me
I need to know everything
I go for a walk
And I see her all the time
Some friends told me that
they saw her with a girl
We were two souls
And we loved each other
But you forgot your promises
Just she had a way
when they found a deadend
Just they try to say
when there is no way
In you they can't trust
when your advices were lies
In things they can't touch
keeping close till their death
Should they just forget
keeping close till their farewell
Should they feel the fear
when their chance is far away
Just they could give up
when the pressure came up
They burn gasoline
They cry tragedy
when their old heaven is dead
They feel gasoline
They trust
Memories
Where's their heaven now

Memories
Where's their heaven now
Just see her eyes
When their freedom diedDie for me  I'll swallow all your pain 
Kill me  Release me from this strain 
Feel it  You are going to be forgotten 
Taste it  The hand of unforgiveness 
I injure myself 
Searching for a way out 
In my eyes you see 
The horror of being alive 
Cry for me  I need this pain to live 
Hate me  I feed on your own sickness 
Breathe it  The stench of selfdestruction 
Love it  It's the only thing that's left to you 
I watch my blood flowing out 
You feel your tears running down 
Hold my wounded flesh now 
I'm the last thing you crave for 
Life is pain 
We're doomed to destroy another one 
Who stands in our way 
'cause we were born under a cursed star 
You wanted to suffer 
But I need a last relief 
I need to bleed 
I need to kill life 
I need to kill life
Once again life is killing me 
This time I know there's no way back 
Left alone abandoned 
Without any chance in tomorrow 
You're gone forever 
As I try to find a reason for this 
Endlessly wondering why 
You burned away all I was living for 
Remembrances are all I still own of you 
As I lie in my bed drunk confused 
Flashes of our past passing before my eyes 
Just like dying endlessly dreaming of you 
Dreaming of forgotten words and smiles 
Trying to push away the need to harm myself 
I feel is growing deep inside of me 
I feel I will have to carve this pain upon my skin 
Loneliness arises from the past 
I will not bear this torment longer 
As I try to hide the painful tears
Frustration increases in my soul
Reminding when I felt so high
Feeling nausea in my lungs suffering
I try to sleep to heal this madness
But this bed now seems to be like my tomb 
Now I know it's all too late to save me 
I keep on dreaming of past years 
I can't feel that warmth anymore 
You turned my existence in a terminal disease 
I know all I once called life ends today 
As you disappear forever flying far away 
All emotions inside of me are dead and gone 
I can't stand this silence but now I'm alone 
I'm alone 
Where have you gone when I needed you 
Never again
Thought I dreamed it again the place where I constantly wander 
So far and wrapped in darkness 
It stands as the incarnation of my obsessions 
My soul is keaving my body once more 
As I enter those wretched ancient walls 
Corridors of postmortem existence 
I breathe the evilness of dark deserted rooms 
Tears falling from my eyes as I walk towars the stairs 
Haunted by something I can't perceive 
A house built on my utter negativity 
Last visions of a fullmoon the frozen nighttime wind 
I lose myself through those endless dungeons 
Take me away take me there where I'm born 
Embrace me in your inhuman angst 
The smell of distant places in my dreams 
Nostalgia take me home
Your only pitiful victory in your pathetic existence 
I'm just waiting for the punishment due 
I'm just waiting to piss on your desecrated tomb 
I'm shivering down my spine 
The ecstasy of buried love finally is me
Froten and still I stand 
Through these rooms of emptiness 
The void in my hands once more 
Awaken to see another day of greyness 
Armless and numb 
All emotions now are gone 
I burn another page 
From the book of my memories 
The way I follow has no return 
I'll face this journey alone 
In every night and in every breath 
You'll drown in the wastelands of my soul 
No other words are left 
No reasons to explain 
My scorn as a farewell message 
Only silence now remains 
Negativity 
Surround me in Your cold dead embrace 
Rape my spirit with Your divine sickness 
Blind is my soul I sold You my life 
My faith shines in every wound 
Fanatical cynicism leads my way now 
We're nothing but tools under Your eternal spell 
My true belief  
Slave to Negativity
Let me die alone in darkness 
Shunned by the light 
Misanthropic death 
Ignore the past life 
No more visions of tomorrow 
Dreaming the death  A tomb in the fog 
A cold tombstone 
Forgotten by everyone 
FORGOTTEN TOMB 
Leave me alone  Let me follow the path to nothing 
Through the Lands of Inhumanity I'll wander 
The black candle light is dying out 
I can see the blackened beauty of death 
Forget me  I'll miss myself in the void 
FORGOTTEN TOMB 
I am alone now 
Only the dark listens to my words 
Forget me
Observe the snow under which i lie with empty eyes 
Losing life remembrances of cries 
Frozen images of last sick days 
The forceless body hanged shows me illfated ways 
Recalling desolation no one cried my death 
The acrid taste of rotting takes my breath away 
My violet lips covered with frost 
The paleness of those walls is lost 
It's fucking lost 
The winter grows cold 
It takes me into the frame of dust and old 
The silence in me 
Please Death set me free 
Fallin' upon my buried coffin 
the snow freezes my last smile 
And the tears are crystallized 
But the pain remains in me 
Still and cold and dead 
My body lies under the ground 
A withered flower falls on me 
Upon the ice of my grave 
ENTOMBED BY WINTER 
Memories of life times lost in my mind 
Ages of a forgotten existence so far now 
Dusty shells of pictures buried by years 
Tell me who i am 
Tell me how to see my dawn 
Tomorrow 
Were we born to struggle and suffer  
Happiness is a short while 
Where we forget to be humans 
Hate is only a waste of time 
The cold is growing end of days 
Hold my body and take me far away 
Far away from this grave of  frost 
We must enjoy these moments of inhumanity 
Before they take our dream away 
ENTOMBED BY WINTER
Last night I walked again that soil 
places in my mind 
Remembrances as cold pieces of glass 
Blood red stained mirrors 
lie broken upon the floor 
A time so far  Something we can't recall 
I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
I can't describe the day 
when we crossed our solitude ways 
Deserted houses  Haven of mine 
Tombs under eternal fog and frost 
The pool of blood is turning cold 
as we watch our reflection 
becoming red as December dusk 
I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
You'll never cry alone in the rain 
The sleep will heal our solitude days 
They'll never live the meaning of parting 
Souls left alone in the night 
as tears flow with the pain 
Loneliness coldness and bloodlust 
Alcohol razorblades and the same old places 
Blood tears and semen 
the only human things will be left of me 
I love the night as I love your eyes 
You'll burn inside the cold lands of my heart 
Our way together towards inhumanity 
Our dreams without any God above 
I'll take your hand towards the night 
where our souls will be as one 
We'll never cry alone in the rain 
Only Death now could divide our solitude ways
Darkness enshrouded from within 
Bitter rest in overwhelming solitude 
Sleeping aeons and mountains 
To conceal the tearing grief 
A human life is not worth more 
Than a tear stolen in a frozen dawn 
Than a drop of blood on a yellowed paper 
Than a shiver in the sharpened rain 
No way out of this terror 
Distance like an empty winter night 
Pieces of me randomly scattered on the floor 
Shrieks of dying animals inside my soul 
Trapped among the mortal ones 
My mourning is in vain 
Unveiled dreams have turned to nothing 
Fed on the wrecks of unanswered questions 
A human life is not worth more 
Than a tear stolen in a frozen dawn 
Than a drop of blood on a yellowed paper 
Than a shiver in the sharpened rain 
No way out of this terror 
Distance like an empty winter night 
Pieces of me randomly scattered on the floor 
Shrieks of dying animals inside my soul 
Silence is trembling screaming its rage 
Screaming 
NO WAY OUT
Lying in a dark corner 
The black candle light is dying out 
Trying to refuse this suffering 
As coldness burns my pale naked flesh 
I faced my fears a thousand times 
Endless doubts  Life of paranoia 
I try to find a way out 
From this state of suicidal urge 
I watch with empty eyes the blade 
As tears begin to fall down my face 
Another night alone with myself 
At one with melancholy and depression 
I bleed because the dark is near 
I cry as i realize you can' t be here 
I need to caress your skin in the night 
But now my only friend remains this knife 
Why must i live with these fears 
I know my only tragedy is my mind 
Sometimes i think i'm wasting all the joys 
And with this bitter thought i fear to die 
I feel so jaded now so far away 
I can't face next morning with this pain 
Another cut lacerates my flesh 
Sometimes i think it will be the last 
I'm only trying to objectivate this hate 
I prove towards myself and life itself 
I only need to watch these fifty wounds 
I opened upon my body in the night 
I only need to stop these sick death thoughts 
And cry for joy when you'll be here again 
I'll watch you sleeping naked at my side 
I'll kiss you and this blood will stop to flow 
Everyone can kill himself one day 
Life brings pain and suffering on our way 
Cut your wrists it's simpler than it seems 
But in death you'll know 
Disheartenment winsMy Soul Was Hidden From The Light
Hidden Far From Others' Sight
Your Beauty Pierced The Surrounding Dark
Upon My Soul It Left Its Mark
Then I Heard Your Angelic Voice
It Was Then I Made My Choice
Problems With My Choice Were Rife
As I Tried To Forsake My Old Life
Your Love Was Nothing But A Lie
Upon Realization My Soul Did Die
I Was Blind But Now I See
That Through My Heart You Killed Me
Of Your Past I Did Not Care
Knowing Only You Weren't There
In Hindsight Of You I Should Have Had Fear
But All I Wanted Was For You To Be Near
My Brain Told Me My Choice Was Wrong
Taken From My World Where I Was Strong
Of My Whole Life I Made A Mess
Searching For Your Fond Caress
All Is Lost For What I Yearned
Return's Impossible My Bridge Is Burned

Things Weren't This Way I Once Was Strong
But Now I'm Weak Can't Carry On
Crushed By Everything That Made This
I Can No Longer Take This
No  What Has Happened To Me
Everything That I Was  Now I Can t Even See
As The Changes Destroy My Mind
Life Is Passing Before My Eyes
Alone In Anguish Cast In Silence
Feelings Of Hatred Masked Thru Violence
Frustrations OverwhelmingEndless Misery
Caged Emotions  Tears Apart Me
Look Beyond My Inner Self
Past My Soul Into Hell
See The Things That Made My Life
Feel The Pain As I Die
Quickly My Life Did Change
Nevermore Shall I Feel Sane
Waiting To End This Life
Waiting I Take This Knife
Quickly My Life Is Fading
Nevermore Shall I Feel Pain
My Life Has Passed Before Me
An Ending That I Shall Not See
Alone In This World from Day One
Created by God  His Only Son
Placed on This Earth to Spread His Disease
Brought Down by Hate  Down to His Knees
Betrayed by Faith by his Lord
Forever Enslaved in Ancient Lore
Crucified for his Sins
God Laughs Satan Wins
Divine Son of God Raised by Believers
NoOne Ever Questioned how he could Deceive us
Fed Off People s Insecurities
Laughing as he ignored Their Pleas
Led His Followers With False Prophecies
Watching them Die Watching Them Bleed
Eternal Life for Your Loyalty
Eternal life of Misery
I'll Take You to Heaven the Kingdom is Yours
Deny Your own Life Submit to the Cause
Change Your Beliefs to fit in With Mine
Grant me Your Soul Till the end of Time
Given a Chance to Repent for his Sins
Delusions of Grandeur Enrobed by Hymns
Nothing but Silence Comes From his Lord
Nothing but Hatred Becomes his Accord
Forsaken by God Nailed to the Cross
The People Don t Care No Great Loss
Rejected by People he was Trying to Save
Nailed up  Between two Knaves
Take Me Away From This Life Of Misery
Grant Me Salvation In The Kingdom Of Thine
Allow Me The Wisdom Of Thy Years
Belief Is StrongThis Is The Time
No More  Will I Suffer
No More  Will I Yearn
This Life  Is Now Over
In Darkness  I Shall Burn
Sorrow Breaks My Body As I Slip Away
The Cataclysm Of Pain Rips Thru My Soul
Life Is What It Always Has Been
And Thru My Death I Take Control
My Lifetime Before Me As I Leave This World
Transcending To A Dimension Aeons Old
One Last Breath Of This PainFilled Life
One Last Breath As I Slowly Die
I Sit In Silence The End Is Near
And Thru It All I Have No Fear
I Sit In Silence The End Is Complete
The Pyre Of Death I Feel Its Heat
Trapped Inside This Unknown Void Of Life I Now Find Myself
Drawn Across This Infinite Depth Of Pain My Life Can Never Be Saved
Suffer Through The Light Embrace The Darkness Feel The Burning Pain
Seep Through Your Life As It Tears Your Soul Apart
Know The End Will Soon Be With You
Now My Nightmare Is Your Reality
I Reach Across This Tomb
Blood Flows From This Wound
A World I Never Knew
A World Together We ll Go
Severed From My Mind My Consciousness Derives Its Last Embrace
Death Above It All I Now Await Its Final Release
Torn From Visions Unknown
In Darkness Dying Alone
Brought Back To Where I Belong
Death Embrace Me Once More
An Infinitude Of Pain Brought About By My Own Life
Twisting Out Of Consciousness Locked In This Tomb
And As I Wait For The Almighty One To Put An End To It All
My Soul Descends From This Womb
And In The Darkness I Find My Withered Shattered Body Wasting Away
My Life A Tragedy Was Nothing But Pain
I Pray That Consciousness Leaves Me Soon  Releases Me From This Hell
For I Know The End Brings Nothingness And An End To The Pain
Nothing But Death Remains
A Final Release From The Pain
A Severing Twist From This Knife
An End To This Darkened Life
A Final Tragedy
Something You'll Never See
An Unknown Darkness Awaits
Taking Me From This Place
A dark force is calling me the black sun enlightens the scenery
The horizon is filled with clouds so pride
In a time when silence is not only a word or a feeling
I'm on my way to march the fields of disbelief
A certain thought my senses disappear
To see will never again be to believe
I'm dying for the chance to be
I'm gonna be the one who tells his son
Not to do what I have done
A time to mourn a time to pray
There are so many words to say
Is this all I can sway
Misery strikes fear into those left behind
Horrible phantasy's erased from my mind
The lost souls will be missed by none
When night has passed and turned into light
Sorrow in my eyes in silence my tears flow
Light of day replaces the darkened light
Here I am among the ones insane dreaming screaming
They tried to take my life
I'm on my way to march the fields of disbelief  
You don't even know what you've become in your life
I feed my weakness with pathetic lies I am blind
Paranoid thoughts so close yet not to find
So here I stand with tears in my eyes
You don't even know what you've become  
I'm gonna be the one who tells his son  
Misery strikes fear into those left behind  repeat]
Promise me you won't look up
It could change your life
Can you handle what you'll find
An open mind  an Attitude
Of Learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate
Born natural machines
For changing information
Changing me
Ride the River out of Eden
The flow of change comes slow
But constantly
Day by day I compete
New brothers in the pool but wait
Most of them won't stay
Guiding chaos into order
Genetic symphony goes on
A brand new score to play
Take a strand of DNA
Slight mutation every day
Survive so I can make my way
And be passed down  down
You  Them  Him  Her
I drive you
Need to survive you
I'll work you like a clock
I write your story
Does our hero live or die
Remains yet to be seen
I need you to survive
You're my machine
Survival of the species
Third in line behind the gene
Behind me
Compared with the machine
The bloodline doesn't prove as thick
Or change a thing
I'm afraid of crossing over
I try to stay alive in you
Your life paves my way
If I really won this fight
If I am intact I will
Construct without delay
A brand new score to play
Take a strand of DNA
Slight mutation every day
Survive so I can make my way
And be passed down  down
You  Them  Him  Her
I drive you
Need to survive you
I'll work you like a clock
I write your story
Does our hero live or die
Remains yet to be seen
I need you to survive
You're my machine
Mother  Father  Sister  Brother
They fight me
They try to hide me
Inside where I belong
I have played my part
You  Me  We  Are
You are me
Think through it clearly
You work me like a clock
You write my story
Does our hero live or die
Remains yet to be seen
I need you to survive
You're my machine
Give me sundown till the light
Give me just one long night
Watch me work and slave away
I'll be done when you awake
Marvel at my bed of silk
Marvel at the one thing I can build
I will call this place a home
A trap for the drifter on the run
Deep in a corner where I wait
He will find me I'm his fate
I'll enjoy him day by day
Cause he'll never get away
I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand
Watch the dew that follows lines
Trickle through this web of mine
You see me can't comprehend
I'm a killer  a friend
You see me don't be afraid
Of this crystal I have made
It gives life to my own kind
And there'll be nothing left behind
I'm more than a witches pet
I am more than a beast
I know that I hide in shadows
But there's a little light in me
I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand
Build your own world
No regrets you have
And do what you have to do
For survival
Build your own world without regret
Do what you must to survive
Soon you'll kill me
Soon you'll kill me
Crush my home with you own hands
Soon you'll smear me
Why do you fear me
Cause I build the dreams you can't
I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand
A stream it flows through time
Without direction
The current holds the line
Abstract Instruction
The liquid of life  You and I
The banks are line with lies
The future is inside
It flows into a child
A great divide
Blueprints passed down the line
River out of Eden
Flow along through time
Carry all that goes into a child
River out of Eden
Your waters drift apart
You brought a new life  It came into this world
Channels forging their own way
Progress never cease
Information can create
An augmented beast
Elements they test the young
Who then will be released
After the trial of life
Blueprints passed down the line
River out of Eden
Flow along through time
Carry all that goes into a child
River out of Eden
Your waters drift apart
You brought a new life  It came into this world
River out of Eden
Filled with what we are
Keep on flowing far beyond this day
River out of Eden
Your waters drift apart
Maybe sometime new life will find its way
Mount Improbable rears up from the plain
Standing tall in the rarefied sky
Once we crawled along its base
It seemed these cliffs could never be climbed
Unattainable heights they tower above
Drive the bravest man to give up
We know it has been scaled before but how
Can you tell me  do you comprehend
Look around the other side
And you will reach a distant land
Who would have thought that you would find
A gradual ascent
Cliffs and echoing canyons
You'd be right to never ever wanna try
But if you take it step by step
The long way  it will lead up into  the sky
Are you a man with time to spare
If so don't be concerned
The back route's sure to get you there
So tell me what you've learned
How do we fit in
It is not just random
Not like a hurricane
That just kept on blowing
Inch by inch we built
This world of wonders
Still we can't see the top
Don't know where we're going
As you go up the hill you look around
And see other wanderers travel
Each on their own going up
Some rest while others struggle
At the top you will find perfection
It's a place you might never see
Maybe at a different time
Chance brings opportunity  to us
Rise up  go on  until you reach the distant land
Our past seems far below  down the trail
How do we fit in
It is not just random
Not like a hurricane
That just kept on blowing
Inch by inch we built
This world of wonders
Still we can't see the top
Don't know where we're going
Too far along to ever think of turning back
Too far to go to ever stop for rest
What stands before seems far too steep to try
Rise above
And survive
Multiply
And cease to be
How do we fit in
It is not just random
Not like a hurricane
That just kept on blowing
Inch by inch we built
This world of wonders
Still we can't see the top
Don't know where we're going
How do we fit in
Tell me are we sleeping
Can we go another step
And keep on growing
Down where it's deep
Your thoughts are complete
All you need is a light
This will lead us unsparingly
Toward theories that cut like a knife
And the sun as it sets
Does not go unnoticed
It makes me wonder
How I can focus on
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
Without that invention
I would not be here
Half an eye for me is perfectly clear
So that I find you wherever you are
I am not blind I just can't see far
And as the sun sets
I will not regret
If I keep on moving
I won't forget
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
Each one lashes out at me
I'm drowning in a deep green sea
I will swim for eternity
Maybe one day I will see more clearly
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
I lie awake wondering who I am
My dreams don't seem to make any sense
Imagination running wild  it can't satisfy my need
Oceans taunt me  I'm a patron to the coast
Dark seas cool breeze  today the tide is low
And then suddenly a shape has caught my eye
Calling me  could not resist or pass it by
On the shore I found an answer
Buried in the sand circles filled with treasure
I took it home to keep it safe
Little spiral in my hand
The stories you can tell
Never cease to captivate me
Just a simple shell
You came out of the sea
Now you belong to me
I hold it close  I know there are many more
It's like a gallery  down on the ocean floor
Shapes and patterns infinite  spelling clues to history
Swept ashore  could not resist or pass it by
On the shore I found an answer
Buried in the sand circles filled with treasure
I took it home to keep it safe
Little spiral in my hand
The stories you can tell
Never cease to captivate me
Just a simple shell
You came out of the sea
Now you belong to me
Moved by the swells
Currents will tell
Tell us you story
So many out there
No one just like my
Immortal coil keep on floating
On the shore I found an answer
Buried in the sand circles filled with treasure
I took it home to keep it safe
Little spiral in my hand
The stories you can tell
Never cease to captivate me
Just a simple shell
You came out of the sea
Now you belong to me
I lie awake knowing who I am
My dreams now seem to make sense again
Come on my friend
Get back to nice again
Let us walk this land
And make it alright
Play this move I make
It's the better way
Let's just do it
And we'll both be fine
I know that there's a chance
You'll stab me in the back
But we'll have none of that
Alright
There's cause to celebrate
Within this game we play
Wash away the hate until we shine
Line missing in the booklet

Look me in the eyes
I won't tell you a lie
Let's build a better world
And make it alright
There are people who defect
But that does not reflect
The good ones who elect
To do it just nice
There's something to be said
For being kind to men
You break we only bend
You have no right
There's more than love at stake
This view of life creates
A better living state

I kill you I'm a lion
Snap your neck and leave you bleeding
I kill you I'm a virus
Destroy you once I'm in
I'm running I can't beat you
That's why I am so fast
I'm running down the food chain
This breath could be my last
Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong the other stronger
Balance shifting how much longer
I'll eat you I'm a shark
Sink my teeth into your flesh
I'll squeeze you I'm a snake
Then down you whole while you're still fresh
I'll hide so you can't see me
Make myself disappear
Competition drives us forward
And blind ambition holds us back
Our tool manipulation
Forcing others' adaptation
Nature learns form its mistakes
Takes generations to improve
Can't run from the higher primates
Unchecked intellect devours
Animal communication
Manipulating other's power
Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong the other stronger
Balance shifting how much longer
Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong the other stronger
Balance shifting how much longer
Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong the other stronger
Balance shifting how much longer
Life was always there
With that I can't agree
This had to start somewhere
That much is clear to me
All this complexity
Traced back to one event
A single moment of
Naked coincidence
Origins and Miracles
In a universe of chance
Copying mistakes are made
So we can advance
Take a mountain of rust
And wait for a breeze
You'll still never see a wind that builds
A perfect machine
A universe without design
Or an entity that's blind
Who built a world without a plan
No final form in mind
In the end there is no goal
Only a chain of questions
Be one of those who answer them
Turn off copy protection
Origins and Miracles
In a universe of chance
Copying mistakes are made
So we can advance
Origins and Miracles
Haunt us day by day
We can make some sense of all
It can be explained
Primate armies slave away
Writing infinitely
Still they can not create
What Shakespeare wrote so easily
Origins and Miracles
In a universe of chance
Copying mistakes are made
So we can advance
Origins and Miracles
Haunt us day by day
We can make some sense of all
It can be explained
Gimme skin behind my legs and arms
And see me glide
Just 'cause it's not soaring
Doesn't mean it can't be flight
10 feet from tree to tree
Is moving to efficiency
Half a wing is everything
If it's all that you need
Gimme wings I wanna fly
Into the air I wanna rise
Getting of the ground
Used to be so easy
You just had to earn your wings
Getting off the ground
Defying gravity
It is everybody's dream
Living on cloud eight
Still waiting for my nine
Nesting in this moment
Waiting in line  Give me time
Wind currents always keep me lifted
If I can feel it
The abnormality of flying
Is best explained by watching
Avionic aspirations
Following fowl play
Structures of steel and strut
The Wright way through the day
Gimme wings I wanna fly
Into the air I wanna rise
Getting of the ground
Used to be so easy
You just had to earn your wings
Getting off the ground
Defying gravity
It is everybody's dream
Living on cloud eight
Still waiting for my nine
Nesting in this moment
Waiting in line  Give me time
Getting of the ground
Used to be so easy
You just had to earn your wings
Getting off the ground
Defying gravity
It is everybody's dream
Living on cloud eight
Still waiting for my nine
Nesting in this moment
Waiting in line  Give me time
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Think  open your mind a little more
Breathe  open your eyes and look around
Feel  that you are a part of something else
Come
Now we travel through both time and space
See the beauty this world has made
View the stages one by one
Explore the change  don't be afraid
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Hear  what the row of voices has to say
Speak  ask them questions on your way
Now we travel through both time and space
See the beauty this world has made
View the stages one by one
Explore the change  don't be afraid
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Learn to teach
And teach to learn
Open your eyes
Knowledge returns
Pass on the word
The modern virus
Spread it through the crowd
Watch it grow
Your mother taught you
How to sing a song
Your father showed you
How to tie a knot
Will you teach your kids
In the same way
Coming generations
Will they play this game
What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe
Every single teacher
Has been taught herself
She takes this information
And feeds the new machine
Once there were wise men
Who told a story
Current tales spread on a web
And rumours fuel the pages
What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe
What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe
In the dark of night a shadow flying
Far above our range can't hear them crying
When the dawn approaches
They're headed to their home
Sleep through the day
To then awake at sunset
They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive
Eyes never seemed to be an option
Left completely blind to hunt in darkness
Their world it has no light
And they don't need it
An image made of sound
To hear around
They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive
Experience with hearing eyes
Light is not the only way to see
Use a different wave
See another way
They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive
Experience with hearing eyes
Light is not the only way to see
They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive
Experience with hearing eyes
Light is not the only way to see
Promise me you won't look up
It could change your life
Can you handle what you'll find
Stories you can not explain
Unfold quite easily
If you see the other side
An open mind
An attitude
Of learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate
We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind
Are there other was to be
Other lives to live
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars
Or above the grass
A new image in your grasp
Focus getting clearer
Seize the moment take it in
Count on this  you just found out
Three sides to every story
None more right not one will win
An open mind
An attitude
Of learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate
We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind
Are there other was to be
Other lives to live
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars
Or above the grass
We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind
Are there other was to be

Ride the River out of Eden
The flow of change comes slow
But constantly
Day by day I compete
New brothers in the pool but wait

A brand new score to play
Take a strand of DNA
Slight mutation every day
Survive so I can make my way
And be passed down  down
You  Them  Him  Her
I drive you
Need to survive you
I'll work you like a clock
I write your story
Does our hero live or die
Remains yet to be seen
I need you to survive
You're my machine
Survival of the species
Third in line behind the gene
Behind me
Compared with the machine
The bloodline doesn't prove as thick

They try to hide me
Inside where I belong
I have played my part
You  Me  We  Are
You are me
Think through it clearly
You work me like a clock
You write my story
Does our hero live or die
Remains yet to be seen
I need you to survive
You're my machine
Give me sundown till the light
Give me just one long night
Watch me work and slave away
I'll be done when you awake
Marvel at my bed of silk
Marvel at the one thing I can build
I will call this place a home
A trap for the drifter on the run
Deep in a corner where I wait
He will find me I'm his fate

Cause he'll never get away
I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me

Watch the dew that follows lines
Trickle through this web of mine

I'm a killer  a friend
You see me don't be afraid
Of this crystal I have made
It gives life to my own kind
And there'll be nothing left behind
I'm more than a witches pet

I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand
Build your own world
No regrets you have
And do what you have to do
For survival
Build your own world without regret
Do what you must to survive
Soon you'll kill me
Soon you'll kill me
Crush my home with you own hands
Soon you'll smear me
Why do you fear me
Cause I build the dreams you can't
I know you fear me
I know you fear me
Fear my home and fear my hands
Soon you'll feel me
Have reason to fear me
Scared 'cause you don't understand

Don't know where we're going
How do we fit in
Tell me are we sleeping
Can we go another step
And keep on growing
Down where it's deep
Your thoughts are complete
All you need is a light
This will lead us unsparingly
Toward theories that cut like a knife
And the sun as it sets
Does not go unnoticed
It makes me wonder
How I can focus on
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
Without that invention
I would not be here
Half an eye for me is perfectly clear
So that I find you wherever you are
I am not blind I just can't see far
And as the sun sets
I will not regret
If I keep on moving
I won't forget
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
Each one lashes out at me
I'm drowning in a deep green sea
I will swim for eternity
Maybe one day I will see more clearly
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
You Eyes
Light up the room
Your eyes
My attention consume
Your eyes
Don't blink too soon
I lie awake wondering who I am
My dreams don't seem to make any sense
Imagination running wild  it can't satisfy my need
Oceans taunt me  I'm a patron to the coast
Dark seas cool breeze  today the tide is low
And then suddenly a shape has caught my eye
Calling me  could not resist or pass it by
On the shore I found an answer
Buried in the sand circles filled with treasure
I took it home to keep it safe
Little spiral in my hand
The stories you can tell
Never cease to captivate me
Just a simple shell
You came out of the sea
Now you belong to me
I hold it close  I know there are many more
It's like a gallery  down on the ocean floor
Shapes and patterns infinite  spelling clues to history
Swept ashore  could not resist or pass it by
On the shore I found an answer
Buried in the sand circles filled with treasure
I took it home to keep it safe
Little spiral in my hand
The stories you can tell
Never cease to captivate me
Just a simple shell
You came out of the sea
Now you belong to me
Moved by the swells
Currents will tell
Tell us you story
So many out there
No one just like my
Immortal coil keep on floating
On the shore I found an answer
Buried in the sand circles filled with treasure
I took it home to keep it safe
Little spiral in my hand
The stories you can tell
Never cease to captivate me
Just a simple shell
You came out of the sea
Now you belong to me
I lie awake knowing who I am
My dreams now seem to make sense again
Come on my friend
Get back to nice again
Let us walk this land
And make it alright
Play this move I make
It's the better way
Let's just do it
And we'll both be fine
I know that there's a chance
You'll stab me in the back
But we'll have none of that
Alright
There's cause to celebrate
Within this game we play
Wash away the hate until we shine
Line missing in the booklet

Delightful combination
Play your part
Look me in the eyes
I won't tell you a lie
Let's build a better world
And make it alright
There are people who defect
But that does not reflect
The good ones who elect
To do it just nice
There's something to be said
For being kind to men
You break we only bend
You have no right
There's more than love at stake
This view of life creates
A better living state
For you and I

I kill you I'm a lion
Snap your neck and leave you bleeding
I kill you I'm a virus
Destroy you once I'm in
I'm running I can't beat you
That's why I am so fast
I'm running down the food chain
This breath could be my last
Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong the other stronger
Balance shifting how much longer
I'll eat you I'm a shark
Sink my teeth into your flesh
I'll squeeze you I'm a snake
Then down you whole while you're still fresh
I'll hide so you can't see me
Make myself disappear
Competition drives us forward
And blind ambition holds us back
Our tool manipulation
Forcing others' adaptation
Nature learns form its mistakes
Takes generations to improve
Can't run from the higher primates
Unchecked intellect devours
Animal communication
Manipulating other's power
Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong the other stronger
Balance shifting how much longer
Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong the other stronger
Balance shifting how much longer
Life is an endless battle raging on and on
Who will last the night and who won't see the dawn
One grows strong the other stronger
Balance shifting how much longer
Life was always there
With that I can't agree
This had to start somewhere
That much is clear to me
All this complexity
Traced back to one event
A single moment of
Naked coincidence
Origins and Miracles
In a universe of chance
Copying mistakes are made
So we can advance
Take a mountain of rust
And wait for a breeze
You'll still never see a wind that builds
A perfect machine
A universe without design
Or an entity that's blind
Who built a world without a plan
No final form in mind
In the end there is no goal
Only a chain of questions
Be one of those who answer them
Turn off copy protection
Origins and Miracles
In a universe of chance
Copying mistakes are made
So we can advance
Origins and Miracles
Haunt us day by day
We can make some sense of all
It can be explained
Primate armies slave away
Writing infinitely
Still they can not create
What Shakespeare wrote so easily
Origins and Miracles
In a universe of chance
Copying mistakes are made
So we can advance
Origins and Miracles
Haunt us day by day
We can make some sense of all
It can be explained
Gimme skin behind my legs and arms
And see me glide
Just 'cause it's not soaring
Doesn't mean it can't be flight
10 feet from tree to tree
Is moving to efficiency
Half a wing is everything
If it's all that you need
Gimme wings I wanna fly
Into the air I wanna rise
Getting of the ground
Used to be so easy
You just had to earn your wings
Getting off the ground
Defying gravity
It is everybody's dream
Living on cloud eight
Still waiting for my nine
Nesting in this moment
Waiting in line  Give me time
Wind currents always keep me lifted
If I can feel it
The abnormality of flying
Is best explained by watching
Avionic aspirations
Following fowl play
Structures of steel and strut
The Wright way through the day
Gimme wings I wanna fly
Into the air I wanna rise
Getting of the ground
Used to be so easy
You just had to earn your wings
Getting off the ground
Defying gravity
It is everybody's dream
Living on cloud eight
Still waiting for my nine
Nesting in this moment
Waiting in line  Give me time
Getting of the ground
Used to be so easy
You just had to earn your wings
Getting off the ground
Defying gravity
It is everybody's dream
Living on cloud eight
Still waiting for my nine
Nesting in this moment
Waiting in line  Give me time
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Think  open your mind a little more
Breathe  open your eyes and look around
Feel  that you are a part of something else
Come
Now we travel through both time and space
See the beauty this world has made
View the stages one by one
Explore the change  don't be afraid
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Hear  what the row of voices has to say
Speak  ask them questions on your way
Now we travel through both time and space
See the beauty this world has made
View the stages one by one
Explore the change  don't be afraid
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Walk  walk with me
And see through my eyes
Try to keep up
And you will understand
Learn to teach
And teach to learn
Open your eyes
Knowledge returns
Pass on the word
The modern virus
Spread it through the crowd
Watch it grow
Your mother taught you
How to sing a song
Your father showed you
How to tie a knot
Will you teach your kids
In the same way
Coming generations
Will they play this game
What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe
Every single teacher
Has been taught herself
She takes this information
And feeds the new machine
Once there were wise men
Who told a story
Current tales spread on a web
And rumours fuel the pages
What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe
What makes us different
Like no other
Is that we can listen
Learn from our father
Mistakes that were made
We don't have to repeat
We've been given a choice
If we care to believe
In the dark of night a shadow flying
Far above our range can't hear them crying
When the dawn approaches
They're headed to their home
Sleep through the day
To then awake at sunset
They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive
Eyes never seemed to be an option
Left completely blind to hunt in darkness
Their world it has no light
And they don't need it
An image made of sound
To hear around
They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive
Experience with hearing eyes
Light is not the only way to see
Use a different wave
See another way
They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive
Experience with hearing eyes
Light is not the only way to see
They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive
Experience with hearing eyes
Light is not the only way to see
Promise me you won't look up
It could change your life
Can you handle what you'll find
Stories you can not explain
Unfold quite easily
If you see the other side
An open mind
An attitude
Of learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate
We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind
Are there other was to be
Other lives to live
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars
Or above the grass
A new image in your grasp
Focus getting clearer
Seize the moment take it in
Count on this  you just found out
Three sides to every story
None more right not one will win
An open mind
An attitude
Of learning about something new
There's always another way
When clouds break and dissipate
We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind
Are there other was to be
Other lives to live
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars
Or above the grass
We are living an illusion
A single point of view
From horizon to horizon
A blind spot in our mind
Are there other was to be
Other lives to live
Meet a girl under the moon
Beneath the stars
Or above the grass
An early morning sweat
pouring like a shower
If only the land was as moist as my skin
But it's not
So wake up dry off take a shower then dry off
It's off to work because it's time
for a good early morning sweat
Heave Lift Leave Swift
Inching forward inching upward
Mother nature now wields her control
Crying from the sky
Swift comes the storm
Everybody standing outside
a beautiful high veld storm has arrived
Temperatures ever so high
Finally show signs they start to subside
An early morning shower
Tin roof perspires
Dancing with raindrops the land comes alive
Cattle that was grazing now wet and grazing
sheep in the barn now relieved of the blazing
Fury through the night the storm still in flight
The racket that's keeping me awake
Dawn now approaches like a flock full of vultures
Before it the storm will surely flake
A moment of peace a wonderful break
Now look at the puddle that once was a lake
Tomorrow the boss has a new field to rake
and in the sun I'll receive another early morning sweat
Now the setting is clear
and we pray for a better year but in the end
It's all in just another day
Broeders van die nasie
vriende van die land
Boer met my spinasie
Met my voete in die sand
Vryheid van die pommies
ons het van hul ontsnap
Tog sien ek vir Isiah
soos hy in die warm son stap
Ons is hulpeloos
Ons ZAR is uit ons greep gesteel
Ek dink nog terug toe dit veilig was
om op die straat te speel
Daai dae is nou verby
en dit lyk dan nou vir my
Dat ons saam moet staan
soos 'n span op die lewe se doellyn
Die slagoffers van die volk
My woede sal geen ander mens vertolk
My siel is gekwes maar ek loer steeds wes
Na die sonsondergang oor Beauford Wes
Maar dit help nie
Die swartes het die langer lont getrek
Ja dit help nie
Die swart man wat nogsteeds my grond bewerk
Onthou nog in die ou dae
Het niemand teruggepraat
Isiah het gewerk soos gewoonlik
en ekt gevreet soos 'n vraat
Die lewe was so maklik
sonder twyfel oor die staat
En saans op my kingsize
op my boepens le ek plat
Kaffers wat net voortplant
verwoes nou my vaderland
Die skerwe van die Broederbond
is nou net deel van die sand
Jou lied is sterk maar jou werkers is sterker
Daarom noem ek jou 'n rassistiese tiet
Wees eerlik met jouself jy is vraatsig en bederf
Spreek uit op hul geen liefde net verdriet
Want ons is hulpeloos en verraai
Ons land word soos 'n 308 ontlaai
Dit is natuurlik vir my innig tragies
Want ek besit die nasie
en ek soek maar net my spasie
Want vir die wit man was Europa net te klein
I will gladly state
I will gladly not vote for the state
You might think it's crime
But I don't want my hands covered in slime
But I have no voice
I'm not even given any choice
These politics
These politicians live just like rats
So what If I cast my cross into the pit
what makes a difference the cross or the culprit
Give me a nation where it works
Democracy that is it is the greatest hoax
ANC is king
The victory song that noone else will sing
Two thirds majority
Honestly what change will my vote bring
Well so what If I cast my cross into the pit
I mean what makes a difference the cross or the culprit
Give me one nation where it works
This socalled democracy I mean it is the greatest of hoaxes
Hoaxes is that even a word Whatever that's not even the point
The point that I'm trying to make is that I don't believe any more
in democracy than I believe in the Moon landings
or Bigfoot
or second chances in relationships
Sure I don't agree with where we are
And where the power lies could be the cause of our demise
Indoctrination propaganda lies
Leave the public brainwashed through their suffering
Political crimes
I regret to say
We may not see the change we dearly crave
But sitting on the fence
is far worse of a national offence
Sun on the windowpane
Slowly eating away
How I wished you'd stay I miss you every day
But now I bellow Why'd you gone astray
Alone I walk in this field
Where friends had lived and by law we had a shield
My love my dear a piece of me has died
And my feet burn on the roadside
'Cause I look to the days of laughter
Fueled by heavy beer
Sitting round the Weber
The smell of leather in the air
But now it seems the time has died of age
I'm sorry that we had to part this way
My Beauty Mercedes Benz
E63 AMG
You carried me to work
Because then of course you were a company perk
When it rained and you got dirty
I would wash you
Eish nee Jabulani sal hom vir jou was
I kept you oiled and your belly fed
I remember the time you had a broken leg
That bliksem Frank yes the HiQ Man
He doesn't know a thing about you
Without you I cannot fall asleep
on your perfectly clad German leather backseat
My life must end I've never felt so onend
Now that you're away because some man stole my pay
So when all is said and done a new day will have to come
Before the setting of the sun I'll buy myself a better one
Look our skin is so white it shimmers in the sun
And with hate we train our children
Division now that is the purest form of society
We maintain We don't fit your system
Our beliefs are built on supremacy
Our Godgiven Aryan beauty
Behold the land that we invaded
Now claim back because we do not steal
Jou baas Haha Is jy swart 'n Wit man het nie 'n baas nie
'n Wit man het 'n kollega
So as you should know there's two types of people
Racists and those who are blind
And if you should ever think otherwise
you're either black or have no mind
Categorize the land in two
To maintain the order of who is who
In this joke of a country our third world circus
The colour spectrum separates in two
So you tell me that there is other cultures It cannot be true
The rainbow nation is simply a myth
There is nothing else that I can ever work with
And there is no one else that carries any worth
From the bottom of my heart
I will pray that we stay apart
So Kommando Korps is waar ons groei
En vir hierdie lieflike volk sal ons nog natuurlik bloei
So Gee vir my net een toespraak gee vir my net een uur
Dan weet al hierdie nat lip laaities wat soek hul hier
Vir Volk en Vaderland
Now we will see what you're really made of
with your bravery torn apart bare
See if there is something more to this inbred old man
who is hiding in his lair
Ek glo in die Heilige Gees
Laat ons vry van swart van vlees
Ek glo aan 'n heilige algemene Christelike kerk
Die welstand van 'n blanke is waartoe ons werk
Die gemeenskap van die heiliges
Ons ras staan by mekaar
Die opstanding van die vlees
Afrikaans in bloed en daad
Die vergewing van sondes
in 'n Afrikaner staat
En in 'n ewige lewe
In Orania
I can't believe we simply look away
While men like these are left to stay
To poison the minds of innocent boys
With far right views with minds they play
The fire of discrimination is fueled
By ignorant bastards who make askew
The values of rigor and pride and power to
Throw in more wood to the hellblazing fire that rages between me and you
So I am a post apartheid child
But I see the way things are
Leaving all your ethics behind
Only so you can trample upon
the ones who are already scarred
So you say that you form no part
And in this great country you have no heart
Then let me make it simple
In the easiest terms I will spell it out
Get the fuck out of my country
Red October a beautiful parade
Joining in daylight a race that's about to fade
We are oppressed and we need to stand tall
And with our raised fists our statement is made
This is a crisis a white genocide
Of thousands of people who's children have cried
Tell me what makes you so special
And why do you have to make it racial
Our country is crippled and you somehow think
that the whites are the only ones suffering
Think about townships that yearn for the slightest nutrition
that you take for granted the people whose lives are
destroyed at the hand of corruption
South Africa's policy of black economic empowerment BEE
is not simply a moral initiative to redress the wrongs of the past
It is a pragmatic growth strategy that aims to realise the country's
full economic potential while helping to bring the black majority into the economic mainstream
No economy can grow by excluding any part of its people
and an economy that is not growing cannot integrate all of its citizens in a meaningful way
Through its BEE policy the government aims to achieve the following objectives
Empower more black people to own and manage enterprises Enterprises are regarded
as blackowned if 51% of the enterprise is owned by black people
and black people have substantial management control of the business

Office
Play this
So i got this fancy new job ne
sitting in a chair and blowing bubbles in the air
My boss he's a really really really nice man
He gave me lots of guidance for our newest business plan
Find us an investor oh the plan is so defiant
But of course we will make sure that he is BEE compliant
If our plans work out this man will pump us full of cash
Then we laugh and dance and eat and drink and spend it on our ass
So thank you FW de Klerk And thank you to everyone who shot him in the back
B and a double E the alternate spelling for the word Democracy
And Thank you Hendrik Verwoerd Without you this country wouldn't be where it should
If it hadn't been for you I'd still be living in Soweto
They took away our country our homeland and our pride
And built it full of roads on which my BMW rides
Now it's time to take back all the riches we have lost
from these postapartheid children who got turned down for my job post
Freedom equality and justice shall reside
within this new certificate my modern assegai
You have an opinion that you'd like me to consider
Silly minority I'm busy got an email to reply
They told me the free water isn't safe to drink
And sold me some new ones in bottles that blink
A bottle that's made in a factory of plastic
That pollutes all of the free drinking water that washes down my sink
The night skyline seems to be on fire
Burning our coal to take our kind higher
We are diurnal beings but yet
This is the goal to which we aspire
Can't you see this great error of logic
To purify ourselves we make the drinking water toxic
The driving by lorry the pumping the taxes
The refrigeration in malls fueled by assets
Now tell me is that Valpré still healthy
I seriously hate Etolls
The financial strain is taking its toll
The Belgians are taking our money away
Our president bathes all his guilt away
In money that he stole from the country he leads
to disarray
Can't you see this great error of logic
To account for the land's debt you rob the public
Gantries that hang over freeways like gallows
Unwilling citizens' lifeblood it swallows
Now tell me is the system still wealthy
Brothers so here we sit
A collection of colours each with its own wit
Lashing out at the other
With words his throat must be slit
Oh we are so blind
I can't believe how we struggle to find a compromise
Find a way to let the strain of Man unwind
Afloat on a windstill lake
No current to pull us
Independent beings aware that we should join ranks
But instead we choose to swim away from the banks
Trying to flee is futile
Your mark has been made and your gravestone is carved
Abandon this land that's so fertile
You coward you fool your soul will be starved
Can you please tell me why do we hate each other
And can you tell me why it is so Goddamn hard
to call each other brother
Look at our beautiful country
A powerful symbol of might
Now see how our people are raping
each other and the land in the night
Can we not slow down
And love our neighbour as asked from heaven far above
So we sit with our heads in the past
Appreciate the land so vast
So I'll ask again
Can you please tell me why do we hate each other
And can you tell me why it is so Goddamn hard
to call each other brother
Realize that all we needed is compassion for each other
A timeless connection like the love that you see between brothersLay it down one last time let this be the last time
I have seen the sunrise just one too many times
With open arms and minds
Stay with me till I find
What it is we search cause I know we want more
On earth as it is in a dime store For all the amateurs that you've
Knelt before
Breaks my mind in two
They surrounds us
One more night without you
They surrounds us
Take my will with you
They surrounds us
Break my mind into
One breathe in to be free
Two more time and you'll see
Three it will numb all the pain
How hard is it to be sane
Won our will to be seen
Raise our hands and we'll scream
Speak your mind and you'll see
What it is like to free
One breather in to be free
Two more times and you'll see
Three it will numb all the pain
How hard is it to be sane
Mothers nursing orphans retreating through the beams
I think that you exist but do you really
Electric correspondence you cannot pay the rent
With hand me down appendages for chemical enslavement
It's not indefinite it's got a lifespan
You try to nurture it hope for extension
As far as right and wrong I know the difference
But right is oh so dull and no one's interested
Amsterdamage doctors prescribing recipes
With side affection stapled to your black jeans
Expressions are revealing just where I'd rather be
But I'm thrown under the bus to try to resurrect a dead scene
Buckle down when it becomes a threat you vocalize a hard truth
So here goes
I've reached the top of this ladder but what did it matter
It's on the wrong wall
Less of a singer you are more
More of a prostitute
With aspirations for a life of sex and drug abuse
When did the music turn into a beauty pageant
Lately my sense of pride has been chronically absent domesticate
So much for combat
My worst habits are mounting a comeback
Dollars and pence cubic or metric
You can sit down but the chairs are electric
Lay in the street embrace the gutter
Its easier than working towards something
Better pull on my boots run through the back door
Should have been more careful what I wished for
Less of an artist you are more more of a xerox machine
You sit tracing the pages of juxtapoz magazine
When did the music turn into a beauty pageant
I've become a participant in something I stood against
I should have never given birth to this monster
From all this shame I'd like to hide my head in the ground
Twice as arrogant as I am talented
Inspiration has been diluted
I'm dependent on this solution
Thank you Tennessee for your contribution
Keep conspiring towards my reduction
There's a nervous breakdown building beneath
This calm exterior but no one seems to notice
Not exactly a charismatic speaker with rising demand
I just get buried deeper
I think it's time I let you know
That my rope ended miles ago
When progression bottoms out
You must consider another route
Anthematic patrons that practice masked identity
For the socially anxious stop the acting
I'd rather navigate the peaks and valleys of unchartered
Headspace
I see and empty space next to the yellow bumble bee
That could be the perfect place to park my broken down ten speed
Just tell me when you get off work and where you'd like to meet
Then we can pedal up and down the crowded New York streets
My shoes are worn out because the breaks don't function
I just put my feet down and let them drag on the pavement
When our legs get tired you can pick a spot to eat
Evelyn's so elegant and Nikolai's right by her side
Under one umbrella just talking and joking
And I knew that I'd love you for as long as you'd let me
And I haven't caught my breath since the moment that we met
We can be alone and not feel lonely
I've been drawing these robots with the pen you sent me
Extraction no one moves
Aggravation is the current mood
Closed accounts prosecute
Dressed in these outdated suits
Transmission incorrect
Is there anyone that's competent
Dismissal but I can't vacate
Forcing my seeds to germinate
Like history in the making
Can we please blur the edges
Of this past memory
This will make for a great story that we will never repeat
So nod your head and tap your feet
Because that's the only review I need
The capillaries ball into a fist
I tuck it safely away inside my pocket
How can I be more obvious
Blazers are worthless when you cant produce a hit
And I hope to be the biggest disappointment
It's not a far commute to access the company of brighter pigments
Administer abuse detach then release a pixilated statement
Recessive paper weights in training school children infiltrate the brainstem
Sexual organs start exchanging
It feels like I'm in a Darger painting Henry must have been lonely
Van city's got a wide array of suspects
They're not afraid to do whatever you suggest
Seems to be no shortage of the excess
So let's dive in let's dive in
A contraceptive verse deceiving so no one figures out what I mean
I'll harvest my tongue negating lyrical parasites in waiting Zip driven amputee
Frustrated can't seem to get a clear connection
You may have hit eject impatient feels like this room is going to cave in
And it could happen this instant
Submerged in an amber grave that's not how you'll calculate your worth
Don't consider it a waste cannot keep from moving in reverse
Don't question me about the content I'm not in the mood for explanation
So figure this out for yourself
Always a spectacle it's a public show
Unimpressed so it's time that I let you go
Reputations from these antics
I may not be pure but I'm not all that toxic
Now I'm checking out and enlisting for stable living
So let's drop the act I've found something that's more appealing
All this dependence on modern machinery
Come for the weekend and you'll stay for the scenery
Tear down the building bludgeon the architect
Biased opinion from outdated intellect
If I wanted to make a comeback would kids receive me
Unemployment I've been ruined by young hands clapping
And we keep sailing with a fear of failing
Listen while they say your name

Sail on Josh

Sail on Josh
I'm not here to discount
The opiate of masses
But I've learned so much more
Attend lectures and classes
Through verbal dissection
Ideas are in suspension
We crash like criminals
In bed with loss prevention
We move when they say
And beg for shit that we
Will never ever need
So keep the receipt
We've become the children
Of paralyzed ambition
A fraction less human
Dining in modern kitchens
Prepackaged warmth with a
Touch of your personal flair
Arrested emotion
Wax poets with a cold stare
Don't you
Try to tell me
The your life
Feels empty
Believe it or not the notes are trying to talk to me
I've got to applaud such valiant efforts
It's not always the party that it seems to be
It can be a complete debacle
This is not the most routine 95 you see
There are some occupational hazards
Perhaps you'll try to save my spot
Just until the album drops
Then I'll be at the Capri shop
Adjacent to the graham L stop
Believe it or not we're not the ideal guys to date
So I guess I'm a risky decision
But you did not write me off you knew that I could change
So I'm studying my guide to safety
It's so hard to tell if this is an artistic achievement
Or am I singing for obligation
When all I want is to feel my heart rate
Accelerate and we accelerate
We all have things to hide We know what has been tried The hard part
That we find is putting pen to paper I know I should expose everything
That's inside But the question that plagues us is can we open our
Lives
I lay it out on the line for all to see
This is how we strive for greatness
Let's share our dark sides this has to be our time
This is our time
I'll open my door with this I let you in
Come one come all
This is our world feel free to come along
Come one come all
Robotic full of doubt
Lets get our frustration out
This microphones a weapon in conjunction with my mouth
Young women and young men
Forgive us if you can
Abandon your best friends
It's demanding and filled with detriment
Leaving your lover home waiting
Putting much faith in her patience
Don't fool yourself it's not endless
Phone calls are poor consolations
We've abandoned our best friendsSo Complex

Above the infernal storm of death
I shall unleash upon mankind
You'll see everyone who dies
Slaughtered by time
In the abyss of no return
Where no light burns
Until the last life on earth
A fire shall be awoken
Our symbols cold go insane and distort
Dark flames like gold burn the solitude of scorn
Gathering the dark of being
As a last way to escape
Depraved defaced Our instinct replaced
Thousand weapons are in me again
Head to head to fight this war again
Embracing and ravishing cold death
Cold death
Cold breath  of cold death
Clandestine dark night
Red as blood filled out
Red as the oath with death
Red as chosen past
I knew the truth inside my veins
I saw their hatred spins twice in darkness
When my blades were risen high and high and high
I chose my path many years ago
When I first knew about death
and its grandeur
Just close a poisoned mouth
Where are your endless purities
You know what my life is made of
Crawling blades upon you
It's raining worms on mankind
Where life seems to be black
Thousand worms of impurity
Worms on mankind
Through fallen seasons of thousand centuries
I shoot myself into oblivion
I'm awaiting your breath on my skin
So my heart will turn black
Let my dragon come back
Feel the power from his black skin
A dark caress of life
A symphonic chant of eternity
At the end of doom the pain never ends
But your long awaited peace is far away from here
Nobody can change the time has come
Nobody can hear this illusion made sound
Under fallen shapes of burning clouds
I still feel pure hate and pain
See the red skies on this twilight
The death is free to come
I'm beaten by his power
Dragon millennium comes out to scream
He's devouring the shores of time
I praise his gloomy signs
Under the dark of his wings
Devouring human's creed
On the earth his rest alive
until his last sigh
Dragon Millennium
I refuse the whole life
Covered by silver plains
I'm here beyond thy grief
Of the unbounded witness
Pierce me up With painful blades
You deserve evil feelings in me
I'm my worst enemy
I'm the confusion
I am your disgrace
Of blood of bleeding hands
Red as red wine
I feel your divine
Essence in blood
Upon the shelter of god
Crimson colours of moonlight
Storming through the veil of time
Insanity reigns in my life
'Cause I've an enemy within
Crimson colours of hate and dread
As a srange dream lurked in earth
Nailing the supreme essence of the night
Could I have a nail more
Let all life fade away
Hollow your heart by compassion
A serenade which sounds black
All around now sounds black
Let the world burn
Leave this world without an end
Because madness has arrived
Riding the winds of times
Rebellion runs divine
In the vein of a beast
Which today has my name
Rise up high my name
Rebellion runs divine
In the vein of a beast
Which today has a dream
Rise up high his dream
I've dreamt about desecration pain and doom doom
The world of today covered by gloom gloom
Pain without sense and fire for remedy
Dark descended to cover the remains
Dark still descends to cover your remains
Let the world burn
Leave this world without an end
Because madness has arrived
Riding the winds of time
Let the world burn
I wait the world praise my name
Dusk is mine and it has come with death and pain
All the blackness of these hills exalt my pride
I've carved my sword in the snow towards the sky
Gloomy howlings  wolves want me
Darkened wings  thousand bats hail me
To be their king  I'll slay
Snowcovered land  I've come to rule
Storming grey castle old for eternity my home
Ancient walls no storm could defeat them
This is my first dusk since I died
Wiser guided by the wolf am I
They are aware of the deep forest
They will forever be my faithful servant
I carve my sword in the snow towards the sky
Take me  castle awaits
Take me  blood is running
We'll light a fire  to hail the moon
We create fire  we'll burn the moon
Ancient am I
Mighty as never before
Enchant the moon
Destroy your soul
 and what was in the ancient past
What they burnt in forgotten days
And every night will have its will
When the wintermoon arises High
My spirit drowns in the abyss of cold stones
Legions of werewolves hail my name
Triumphant with a scythe in my hand
Laugh seeing the abyss filled with angels Dead
Many years passed but I was not aware
of the power that day by day was to recreate my spirit
on this domain this forgotten domain
the mist will not allow any mortal being
 and what was in the ancient past
What they burnt in forgotten days
And every night will have its will
When the wintermoon arises High
When the man thinks to be stronger
And the dream of power run into his vein
The chaos rise from the blood of Ira
My silent bright enthrone his freeble heart
I saw the devil smiling
I saw  the immolations
I saw the light in the face of death I blame
I saw the universe
I am the son of scorn
I saw the hunter hunted by his prey
I saw the wind to blowout from the earth
I saw the light eaten by the night
I saw the death pregnant of life
I saw the sperm red as blood I never see
I saw the mother eat her son
I saw the dead arise from his tomb
With the flames of hell deep in the flesh of sigh  sigh
When my eyes are black as the night
And my heart is cold as ice
And the dream of power run into my vein
And become reality
I am the son of scorn
I feel the evil inside my flesh
I feel the hate run deep into my vein
I feel the flames of hell on my skin
I am the power I am supreme race
I am the one who give the reason
I'm the face of abomination
Destructive as the flames of time
Anger from my infinite night
Like an armoured angel
Like a beast with the devil inside
I am thy war
In decay they fall
Regret and pain  deep as hell
Tormenting power  like a blowing spell
Forever I hear the way of splendour
Forever I mean it like a true tormentor
Rebellion and pride free to run
This is my blasphemy for the sun
Regret and pain  deep as hell
Tormenting power  like a blowing spell
It's hard to follow
In decay they fall fall
forever fall
It's hard to follow
The enchant of torment
The will of perfection
Agony of my life
The light of thunder in my eyes
The pain deep under in disguise
Do you feel my pleasure It's for you pain or life
Feel my unholy dominion this power will be shine
Forever I hear the way of splendour
Forever I mean it like a true tormentor
Erected son Of this earth
Spread the scorn you have forgetDenim Leather Thrash is what we are

Thrashing smashingPosers on the floor
We'll leave you on the floorbruised and sore
Thrash Is Back

Saying thrash is back with their fist in the air
Thrash Is Back

Run on the stage jump in the crowd
They catch you as you fall from the air
The lights hit your face as you surf the crowd
You see the band on the stage
Kicked in the head
By a white high top
The mark is left on your face
Turned and tossed by the people below
Until you fall in the hole
The crowd pulls you in to the circle pit
Slamming and banging your head
A thrasher falls you help him up
Slamming the posers to death
Singing along while your knees hit your face
Not giving a damn who's in your way
Your hearts beating fast as your pitting away
Thrash Will Never Die

Evil rising from the ground
Tumbling walls a piercing sound

Judgment day from the underground
Burning hell hounds coming for your town
Fight for your right to live

Dark lit fire the gates of hell
Six times you hear the judgement bell
Out walks now the commanding beast
He wants your life for his bloody beast

You have nothing left to stand up and fight
Bow down on to your knees
He crushes your face
His victory
Fight for your right to live
So fight
Fighting death till your end

You watched your children burn alive
It's your fault your children died
The walls of death you can not cross

In the circle pit you'll die
Mess with us you won't survive

The earth screams of pain
The birth of metal can not be tamed
Winter Sun freezes the land
Tornado of Soul filled with the dammed
Judas rising from the abyss
Metals birth can not be missed
Metal militia sweeps across the land
Salvation for those who hold metal in their hands
Death in the Iron Maiden for those who are week
Black Sabbath today metal reign is at its peek
Venom from his serpent fangs
Slithers its way into your veins
Slayer of the weak you are next
Get ready for your Megadeth
In the Metal Church
Read the book
Testament reveals
This is the truth
Meta will reign
And you shall be forever in pain
She's from whom is behind her
Screaming with terror in mind
The nightmare attacks
There's nowhere to run
Theres something screeching out side
She doesn't want to sleep alone
Now she's trapped in her dream
With blood on his glovesand knives on his hands
He haunts her from the fire below
Dreams of Terror

Good vs Evil Evil vs Good
Choose your Side now
'Cause that's all you could
People say it's right
But other's say it's wrong
The decisions up to you
Forced to kill is your command
Destruction on another
Is what he Want's
Forced by the beast to believe
That it's right It's the final command
Evil Mind of the Dreadful
Destruction Annihilation of the Vengeful
Command of the Beast
War Starts now the worlds in his hands
Power of the beast people starts to run

Evil Mind of the Dreadful
Destruction Annihilation of the Vengeful
Command of the Beast
The Holocaust is here with power he attacked

People dying Children cryond Nations gone
Shootion guns helpless people fall
Command of the beast

Crushing our creation Total Annihilation

Victims cry in pain
Terrors now raised taking your life
Under attack there's no turning back
The never ending swarm a million more destroyed
Evil Mind of the Dreadful
Destruction Annihilation of the Vengeful
Command of the Beast
The winter eats into me
It snows in my heart
I always bear my heart
Naked outside of me
Like a tingling bell
But my heart is not
Of iron and steel
Thus I easily break it
Thorns nails and pales
Sticks in the blood covering my heart
Will I be taken from
The shadow of far night
I'm hearing the sound of
Death breathing in my ears
A silence like
Under the wings
Of a dead bird
A silence like
The quietude
Of open graves
I'm hearing the songs of
The birds no more
Nor the wind nor the whistling of
My own blood in my ears
She lays there dressed in silk
So pale so cold
Your door has opened for all to see
The pitiness that we suffer
Guided to where no man returns
 or ever will it is eternity
A spokesman of God
Gives the beauty away
You door has been opened for all to see
The pitiness that we suffer
Guided to where no man returns
 or ever will it is eternity
A brief moment in black
Is that all
When nightfall class the earth
Shadeless flowers sleep
Mankind lies in emptiness
All the mourners weep in silence
We stride towards sick winds
Rain fills our lungs
God's tears inside
So grim yet beautiful in your soul
Are you too of this awe
Then hope you have doomed one
When nightfall clasps the earth
Man humbles himself
Becomes obedient to death and godlessness
We will all die
We will receive
The goal of our faith
When nightfall clasps the earth
Angels sing their praises
Have patience dying faces
Tears in my eyes
Tortured and twisted
The emotions of mine
Pain and decay
All of the kind
Surrounds mankind
Until they die
The soul will be
Into new flesh borned
Never have I
Questioned eternal life
If I can't have this
I want nothing
No God can hold me
They will all abandon me
I will be
Released from all
Darkness and pain
Peek through wall of sadness
Behold what you adore
Cities of happiness
Decompose to black rot
With tones of Ariels voice
I mourn the bitter end
Tro ei på hjertets lyst
Følg meg til evig sorg
Vik du ornament svart
Depress turns to agress
Sjels fred tungt adventes
Doom at which I curse you
Please save me from myself
Life holds no joy but you
In a doomed and adoring way
We are dying together as oneI played the painter on my skin
And engraved some figures on it
Push them away
Suppurated became my draws
The stinking precious waste
Push them away
I poured some salt into my wounds
and softened them with cottonwool
Push them away
Attempted to extract this gem
the fucking black bile
Push them away
Set your arms free leave your corpse
Departure for the ultimate trip
Climb high seize the speed
Never get back Always making for the cold
Fix the raw energy of the earth
Set destination to nowhere nowhen
Outside of space outside of time inside of you
Ought to leave your eyes now
No need further
Mental metaperception
Unlinking of soul anchors
Complete dehumanization
Irresistible attraction for the void
Sickness behind the mask of gold
Oh these years of misconception
Would have led anyone in a place of mist
Uncertainty fools one
Blind be the meek
For they shall stand in the middle of the path
Don't ever give a glance at your sides
Keep the way enlightened
Don't let darkness be evermore
Another path there is
That hurts heart and soul
It shows both truth and scorn
Its end reveals wisdom and despair
Tightest links are those
You tie around your own world
Blindest eyes will ever see
But yet the Chrysalis that's weaved is hollow and dead
A meaningless existence implies an arbitrary end
Let people die
Please let people die
Please please cease their suffering
One person you don't take care of
Is one more for oblivion
Let people die
Please let people die
Please please cease their suffering
A dead you let go with a flower
Concerned by a cold fluctuation
Trade a vegetable against another one
One more sore to be scared
One more lie to erase
One more ball to my ankle
OK that's it
Couldn't feel the change
Reality has warped so let's face it
Years have passed
Forgotten how the pain is disguised
But still hiding away from the sun
A fist plunges into my chest
And extracts a blood weeping heart
Crooked hands scraping my entrails
The pills are out of mine now
That cleans and resets
Couldn't see the thing
Hiding away from the sun
In the corner the waving stigmatas of heat
The vertical bars sweat the blissful light
Candies spilled around me
A chemical constellation tells a story
That no man should ever hear
Blind am I hidden away away from the sun
A swollen stomach filling the space
Solid turning to liquid
A slow explosion all is calm after
Germ deliverance and asphyxia
A splendid rebirth in thousand worms
A plumpy breed a crawly offspring
A deathly life and mortal stink
Blackness stuffing wood and nails
The stench in your coffin sums up your whole lifeNameless incarnation of hatred
No reason to live
but to cause discord and pain
I bear the mark of the fallen one
Touch me and be cursed
Love me and be enslaved
Join me and be damned
Trust me and be forgotten
There is no rest within my soul
A cold indifference distorts my aura
On the path that I wander
there is no equilibrium
Witness the fire of my hatred
It exhausts the souls of the guilty ones
Guilty for their prideless daze
I donate you nothing but scorn
embrace you with wings of indifference
desecrate you with a serpent's kiss
redeem you into the void  of oblivion
On the ruins of creation
Dying promethic embers
turn the world into darkness
There is no bright wisdom
no place for self control
without a link to our true nature
Return to provenance
Realize internalize
this world is built on mire and rot
Worshipping idols wasting breath
blind from selfdeception
Denying the instinct turns us away
from the creation as it was meant to be
Strive against the grasp of the demonself
Within lies all enlightenment
So don't be a fool and realize
that it's not you that ponders
moans and falls down in weakness
The pain of the world weighs on your shoulders
It's not your sorrow it's not your soul
Don't believe in anything but in your selfcontrol
Command and navigate the ship to the open sea
We drown in the deception of daylight
Blinded by this shallow life
its lucid fruition that we strive
we long for dark illumination
Emerging from the shadows
where life is always pure
we wander dormant paths
of sunless and mournful days
Waiting for the era of rising wisdom
we are assembling unseen forces in the haze
We rise in the purity of the nightfall
Embraced by darkness
all our will through ancient forces is fulfilled
We reign in dark illumination
Darkness   ultimate perception
The essence of all the things we reach
Countless treasures can be found
Spirits of the night will teach
See the one encircled in the bloody shambles
Her eyebeam rigid
her whole body trembles
Oh lustful stranded slut
go on and never stop
Defiant and keen
she took the opaque pill of rapture
Inebriant venom enriched her horny blood
A hot blooded bitch
moans with uttermost pleasure
Predetermined for destructive self immolation
Oh fucking naive bitch
you are the one we ditch
Lecherous breathing
Dionysian Eucharist
The air turns sultry as her dance gets faster
A sweat dripping body
in elusive ecstasy jubilantly passes away
In self destructive glory
her knees start trembling
as she wettens her pearl thong
No girls for the ring
but a death worshipping cunt
Dionysian Eucharist
the ecstasy of lust and death
Dionysian Eucharist
no feeling for life but through pain
See the devout feast of selfsacrifice
in the name of flesh lust and death
An out drying vixen exhaling her last breath
Encircled by the votaries of ruin and submission
There is no end beyond all boundaries
in the realm of death's recognition
Driven by ominous beats
forced to dance herself to death
For entrancement and the pleasure of pain
Beyond all boundaries of earth reaches the soul
on wings of imagination
My fervent longing climbs to distant spheres
Earthbound but gazing at the stars I feel my disease
Restrictive is the cage of the cold material world
Emotions are withered in the desert of mediocrity
Pureness tainted by a putrid surface
Embers within no longer burn
The brothership of lowleveled thoughts corrupts
my spirit and soul
In a world of perhaps and may nothing is real
The brothership murmurs
Obey or take your life away
Beyond all boundaries of earth reaches the curse
of collective deception
A mournful longing remains
The wind keeps on whispering of stories untold
A lonely soul against the pain of the world
A feeble voice breaks off in the choir of denial
Come with me follow me come with me
Darker days in the haze darker days
We will see not just be we will see
Take my hand and feel the end take my hand
Pain and fear will disappear pain and fear
In dreadful lands when the dark descends in dreadful lands
Deceptive light drowns in the night deceptive light
Society leave me be society
Makes me sad everyone dead makes me sad
In this night I feel no fright in this night
I will leave without grief I will leave
No remorse no turning back
Can't you see disharmony can't you see
Twilight and phlegmatic unlight
A chilling thunder roars from the distant mountainside
A raging storm is rising it takes all doubt away
Being part of an endless circle eases all pain and fear
My name is dead and gone my trace will disappear
A timeless moment of now
brushes away the tears from the past
A state of crystalline clarity
brings back my inner entirety
A silent yet deep understanding
speaks with words without meaning
The universe and I
are floating in eternal patterns
The mirror of self reflection has burst
Perception trespassed all borders
The awakening of the third eye
connects me to the cosmic strings
When all earthly boundaries end
begins my vision of entirety
I am dead but immortal
I am dreaming myself to life
I am all and all is me
Creation has fulfilled
In a state of dissolution
when despair becomes my mind
in a moment of crushing pain
my earthly life ends
I feel a manic obsession
Let me suffer and I'll obey you
Sweet torment caresses my lust
I'm a servant to whatever hurts
Selfdestruction beloved enemy
Selfdestruction beyond remedy
Pain holds me down but my spirit awakes
Lament and gloom feed the demon within
The scars in my flesh
reflect the scars in my soul
Thanatomiania a secret suicide
Selfdestruction beloved enemy
Selfdestruction beyond remedy
Selfdestruction master of disharmony
Selfdestruction mirrored through misanthropy
Misery is precious treasure
It makes my dead soul feel alive
Calamity is my only pleasure
In a world so cold nothing's worth to strive
I feel severed from this life
I feel severed from god's creation
The moment of death will be my rescue
nothingness heals all wounds
Oblivion is my benediction
the loss of life my greatest gift
The blood that runs out of my veins
makes me calm
For the first time in my life
I feel satisfied
Eradicate my mortality
release me into eternityIn to cave corpse
Flesh intense
Wounded stomach skin
Perverse lust
Morbid and mortality

Silence is in my mind and sickness I think
On this mortal wasted and stiff my head
And smell the puss and the rotten gore
Rotten Tissue Bowels Beauty
Into cavities I scrape one hole
Singles parts of bodies what I can erase fear

Rich and precarious leg
Full worms of death

And for that you have an uterine tumor

An unsightly fetus

Of eliminating it
You know that your body this very damaged inside
That you could not retain the son that this there

Before We Fuck Some MoreRedemption always comes from the sky 
There's no escape They deserve to perish
Pain and torture will open the gates of mass delirium
Strike all the cowards to the ground their cursed souls shall never rest
Let my wrath spread upon the infidels so eager to murder their king
The impure blood that will flow from their wounds
Will never be enough to quench my thirst or avenge this insult
Make them suffer  Make them pay  Souls will plunge into decay
Death by torture  The tormented souls shall be lost in eternal fire
BURN  The harbingers of death shall be the Birds of Sulphur
Faithless  Unholy Forest Dwellers 
I will have your bodies charred in the flames of this world
Perun has prepared your stake eternal
Heralds of fire
Open the gate to the underworld
Redemption will come from the sky
The harbingers of death shall be the Birds of Sulphur BURN 
Attack  Hunt them down  Hack chop dismember 
No cell no prisoner
Burn Iskorosten burn
Redeeming fire  They will pay with ashes
The Birds of Sulphur shall cleanse our lands of all their sins
Purification through flames Unleash you fury 
Be the heralds of fire and make Iskorosten burn
Spread my wrath
Redeeming fire will fall from the sky
Fire will fall from the sky
Flattery being the most effective weapon to defeat the enemy
They'll be led to believe they will be borne in their ship to the castle Lured into the gaping hole that will close upon them
They are worthy only of death We'll bury them all alive
They shall fall into my pit of vengeance Let them sail their grave into the earth
Nothing comes easier than killing a man A man who believes he has won the war The distant leader wants to marry the
Queen to gain ultimate power They came to declare a truce trickery penance for such abuse
With great honor I send you sailing into the earth
For the murder of the king incarnation of God I promise such a painful death that he will hear you suffer from the underworld The heart of a widow is colder than mud
They are worthy only of death
We'll bury them all alive They shall fall into my pit of vengeance
Let them sail their grave into the earth Nothing comes easier than killing a man
A man who believes he has won the war
They shall drown in a sea of mud souls damnation a permanent flood
Great pits will be dug on the shore to trap and destroy the soldiers
With great honor I send you sailing into the earth You shall be erased from all memories I send you sailing into the earth
The sovereign of the earth will bring you to your knees
You'll feed the worms and be as one with the earth I want to feel your suffering and stamp the earth down over your grave
You shall fall into my pit of vengeance Your will sail your grave into the earth Nothing comes easier than killing men
Men who believe they already own the kingdom
These statues are no gods 
Just useless objects carved of wood Now they may exist but soon they will be reduced to nothing Left to rot away erased by time their ashes swept away by the wind
These soulless gods you worship are neither sacred nor human
We only built them with our own hands
But what good have these gods done 
A single element can sink them into oblivion What good have done those gods 
We only built them with our own hands I don't want to give my soul to demons
I will lay the foundation stone for the sacred new empire And God shall be the witness
I'll carry out my flawless plan
Tomorrow everything will change
You'll bow down to me
There is only one God 
Gods who let the kings die don't deserve to be honored If the regent converts or give up the kingdom The cult figures shall burn They will become meaningless
Perun alone is worthy to bear the name of God `
But as he is a vengeful spirit he can't wash me of my sins
I must harness the elements to take my revenge
Let fire burn them water drown them earth bury them
And let their cries for mercy be carried on the wind only then will I find peace
Faith will bring us a new way of life the road to redemption
When my time comes I will rejoice in eternal rest Looking down upon my work from heaven I will laugh at the chaos I created I will avenge the King 
Impure blood shall drench the earth
My new road leads south
I will not look behind me
Moving from hell towards the light their God is my God I will lay the foundation stone for the sacred new empire And God shall be the witness
I'll carry out my flawless plan Tomorrow everything will change
You'll bow down to me
They have learnt to fight in the forest and live in harmony with nature
They have knowledge of a territory that is hostile to us
I know there is nothing they can fear
But the anger of the Queen
The Axe of God The Axe of their own God
We can't let them have an opportunity to control the entire river
But it would certainly be the best way to bring them down
Tonight the Axe will collect a bloody harvest of heads
Let the Almighty Perun lend me strength and bravery
And let the gruesome scene of your impaled bodies along the ways
Reveal to the world the price of such a crime
Let the Almighty Perun lend me strength and bravery
I swear the eternal oath  I am now the arm of God
The Axe of God
You will ever regret your felony
When my soldiers rape your wives
And when I make your children be my slaves until they die
This is the first tribe that refused to submit to the king's command
They must be the only ones who chose to fight against our will
Now they no longer believe in knowing the slightest fear
It's time to for them to pay
Befall on their heads the wrath of gods
I know there is nothing they can fear
But the Axe of their own God
Vengeance is ours
Now vengeance is mine
O dear traitors come confidently
I wish you to come by the thousand
Gallons of mead shall be prepared in the city where the King was killed
Let us cry on his grave and have a ceremony for him
It's in sign of peace I invite you all to a great banquet I promise that there will be more than enough to eat and drink
You may taste many beverages that even the gods could never dream of
But I cannot give my hand while I am in mourning
It is time to get to know each other Now 
Let's found a new and stronger kingdom together
Unveil all your secrets
We know how to subjugate
O dear traitors 
Only a blood bath can wash you of your sins
You will swallow the bitter flood of your own death
Now you shall face the raging river of our merciless vengeance
You're invited to the funeral that will soon be yours
Panic  Laughter 
You'll be howling with pain
When the wine in your mouth turns into blood
Under the sharp daggers of my soldiers
Only your pain will wash your sins
You will know the punishment of the Luxurious Soon Dark blood will feed the earth
Now you shall face the raging river of our merciless vengeance
You're invited to the funeral that will soon be yours
The wild ones must be slain
Vengeance fulfilled by the wrath of the Great One
O Perun  Utter the ancient words of power
Allow me to cast a merciless doom upon them
O Perun  May we strike them harder than stone
Let's remember
We must remind them the holy power belongs only to us
And none but the gods have decided
Varangians always had control of the River
It's time to prove it It's time to prove it now
If they feel at one with the earth
I promise they will soon be as one
Their lungs will be filled with mud and worms
They will drown in their own blood Their bones will be consumed by flames
And their suffering will be engraved in the air
Let's remember
We must remind them the holy power belongs only to us
And none but the gods have decided
Varangians always had control of the river
It's time to prove it It's time to prove it Now 
We will erect a memorial to the glory of the King Sculptured by suffering and tormented cries
A divine masterpiece made with our own hands
That will be etched in the winds forever
I swear he will soon join you My pain carried by the wind
I swear I will avenge you He so wants to take your place I'm afraid he has no fear
But I've sworn I will go through with my duty
The cries of pain shall echo in the air to be carved in the wind
This is how we will accomplish this terrifying work Let Stribog spread the chant of agony
Let's remember
We must remind them the holy power belongs only to us
And none but the gods have decided
Let Stribog spread the chant of their agony
And carve their suffering in the wind
When the best men of Dereva arrive
They will be welcomed with open arms
Here they will find the food the women and the wine
Soak the shoots of birch
Heat the water scorching hot
Fill the room with steam
Until they can barely see each other
We'll send for the most graceful women of all the land
To serve and pleasure you
We'll do everything to make our guests feel at ease
Soak the shoots of birch
Heat the water scorching hot
Fill the room with steam
Until you can barely see each other
Only the most illustrious men are welcome
Then we may go to your prince with great honor
So make your first steps into heaven on earth Here life is only pleasure and delight
Give way to your most unholy desires
Burn  Illfamed traitors  Now suffer my wrath 
Soon the burning breath of vengeance will escape from your bodies
You shall taste our Varangian Paradise
After you all have bathed you shall come to me
Steam so thick you can't see anymore
Scorching heat becomes the air you breathe
Sighs are filled with suffocating smoke
Thrash kick and lick your bodies with burning tongues
The love juice running down
Your thighs burning and boiling
We can wait for years outside
Great will be our pleasure to hear you beg
We know it won't be long before you to run out of resources
Soon you will not have enough to survive
You'll become only dead branches
And I'll burn all traces of your existence
We are the wolves among the herd
We'll take out the whole flock one by one
If you do not kill us now we will destroy you all
So get out of your cage and pay what we demand
Let the eternal punishment befall on your heads
You're about to pay your debt with your own blood
I can't content myself with honey wax and furs
But your muddy blood that will nourish the roots
Of the World Tree you have betrayed
We are the wolves among the herd
We'll take out the whole flock one by one
If you do not kill us now we will destroy you all
So get out of your cage and pay what we demand
Let the eternal punishment befall on your heads
You're about to pay your debt with your own blood
Mindless fools  Will you abandon madness for reason 
Let the eternal punishment befall on your heads
You're about to pay your debt with your own blood
This fortress will become your tomb
Troops are hidden in the deep dark of night
We'll crush the last hope of your kind
We are wolves among the herd
We'll take out the whole flock one by one
If you do not kill us now we will destroy you all So get out of your cage and pay what we demand
Let the eternal punishment befall on your heads
You're about to pay your debt with your own bloodEthereal Universe

Is this the feeling I've been searching for
I'm never ever gonna ask for more
'Cause now I've found it and now we're here to stay
The demons are crawling away
The underworld has left them behind
From a distance you hear them moaning now
Like plagued creatures of the night at sunrise

Liar  do you believe in the future
Or do you feel lost in the vortex of nightmares
Liar  I can sense your affection
In whats been feeding on the lies and redemption
You made your bed on the throne of deception
Back then your destiny was never a question
But now I stand here with you faith in my hands
Well do you fear my revenge
Do you fear I'll deceive you
Liar  in this darkness where is your God
Where is your soul divine
Liar  can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died tonight
Can you breathe the filthy air so tell me how it feels
Can you learn to love someone if you cant see what is real
Can you feel the burning fear that tears you up inside
And you don't sleep at night 'cause creatures disembowel all your dreams
Liar  in this darkness where is your God
Where is your soul divine
Liar  can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died tonight
Well I don't want you and I don't need you
You made your bed on the throne of deception
Back then your destiny was never a question
Liar  in this darkness where is your God
Where is your soul divine
Liar  can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died
Liar  in this darkness where is your God
Where is your soul divine
Liar  can you answer what is the truth

Silent hands
Crush you down
Beat you up
You hit the ground
Silent hands
Break your neck
Tear you apart
Until you die
Do you wanna be another believer
Do you wanna be alone and forlorn
Are you gonna take the charge of your own life
And start to fight back against invisible forces
Silent hands are feeling nothing
Once again you fall apart
Silent hands are afraid of something
In the end you'll tell them why
Silent hands
Break your bones
Mess you up
You stand your ground
Do you wanna be another believer
Do you wanna be another lost soul
Are you gonna take the charge of your own life
And start to fight back against invisible forces
Silent hands are feeling nothing
Once again you fall apart
Silent hands are afraid of something
In the end you'll tell them why
Can't you see I'm the one
Can't you see it's not forgotten
I will live another day
Let my shadow lead the way
Do you wanna be another believer
Do you wanna be alone and forlorn
Are you gonna take the charge of your own life
And start to fight back against invisible forces
Hear me
Won't you hear me now
Hear me
Won't you hear me now
Life can bring you down
I know you're suffering in your hell
But you will get around
Just remember one last thing
Life lies
The light disappears
And your faith is now sealed
When the final deed is done
Shed the blood for the
Almighty Goat Footed God
Will he now bring you home
Can I save you from the torment in your mind
It is time to lock up your world and enter mine
With seven horns and seven eyes
The dark will find its sacrifice
And it's too late to realize you did it all
I can't undo what you have done
But I am righteously the one
To make you understand that anyone can fall
Can I save you from the torment in your mind
It is time to lock up your world and enter mine
Can I save you from the evilness you need
Can I teach you about the power 616
Can I save you from the torment in your mind Six sixteen
It is time to lock up your world and enter mine Six sixteen
It is time to lock up your world and enter mine
It's a dark day for evilness
I can't save you if you can't save yourself
A faint shadow in the corner of your eye
A pale reflection was there something passing by
Night cool air has brought with it the sneaking mist
You walk in solitude be careful what you wish for
With a desire that is stronger than death
A sense of awe that you will never forget
Blood runs cold through veins of dreadful memories
Return of disorder enter true insanity
You are the one that he cannot resist
He will be roaming through the shadows and mist
For his love of a lifetime
You are the one that he cannot resist
Tonight tonight
You feel the weakness and you have to obey
An ancient spell born deep beyond the cold grave
All beauty innocence once has to fade
Prolong existence and give all that he craves
You are the one that he cannot resist
Tonight tonight
You breathe the darkness it's got to be nice
You seek his power so there's no need to fight
Even eternity needs blood in it's veins
'Cause when you wake up it will start all over again
You are the one that he cannot resist
He will be roaming through the shadows and mist
For his love of a lifetime
You are the one that he cannot resist
He will be roaming through the shadows and mist
For his love of a lifetime
You are the one that he cannot resist
Tonight tonight
You bring me to my knees
This is the holy system
No evolution
And God created all
I wanna save you
'Cause Satan is the one I love
I wanna save you
'Cause Satan is inside
Fight
Revenge
It's not too late to realise
Angels 
Will get sacrificed
Fight
Resist
We cannot all be crucified
Angels
Know it's justified
You forced it upon me
The beauty of fanatism
Now it's all twisted
'Cause I've become the beast
I wanna save you
'Cause Satan is the one I love
I wanna save you
'Cause Satan is inside
Fight
Revenge
It's not too late to realise
Angels 
Will get sacrificed
Fight
Resist
We cannot all be crucified
Angels
Know it's justified
Fight
Revenge
Resist
All fanatics
Fight
Revenge
Resist
Those who feed on the blind
Fight

Revenge
It's not too late to realise
Angels 
Will get sacrificed
Fight
Resist
We cannot all be crucified
Angels
Know it's justified
Angels
Know it's justified
Where noone knows you
Don't bore them with your defense now
Where noone knows you
The time has come to realise
That noone wants you
You don't have any friends here
'Cause noone knows you
You fade into the dust and find
Darkness
Is all that I want tonight
You save me every time
Darkness
Is all that I want for life
You saved my life tonight
Where noone knows you
Don't bore them with your defense now
You know you're an outcast
The time has come to roll the dice
But why would it change them
They choose to live life in shallowness
Blind as bats
One day they might realise
Darkness
Is all that I want tonight
You save me every time
Darkness
Is all that I want for life
You save my life tonight
Darkness
Where noone knows you
Don't bore them with your defense now
Where noone knows you
The time has come to realise
That noone wants you
You don't have any friends here
'Cause noone knows you
You fade into the dust and find
Darkness
Darkness
Beyond the valley
Of faded grey souls
The trees lay dead
In the forrest where noone goes
The beast is served
Hell opens the gate
A stench fills the air
And the sky's painted red
Bring on the pain and the creeping death
You steal their hopes lead a madness quest
You've got a taste for extinction of the mind
Don't you understand
You bring them down leave them there to rot
Banish the weak and then drown the lot
Keep them alive till their dreams
are all buried and gone
Don't you understand
Don't you understand
Need you once again
Until you bleed
This time
They live a life in the world of death
Dreams of the future is all they got
But now their dreams are slowly dying too
Don't you understand
I'm just like you I'm the undergod
Deep in the dark will my kingdom come
I am the beast you created
I'm your nemesis
Don't you understand
Don't you understand
Need you once again
Until you bleed
This time
The beast is calling it's seeking the light
The beast is calling it feeds on your life
The beast is calling it's seeking the light
The beast is calling it feeds on your life
The beast
Don't you understand
Beyond the valley
Of faded grey souls
The trees lay dead
In the forrest where noone goes
The beast is served
Hell opens the gate
A stench fills the air
And the sky's painted red
Liar  do you believe in the future
Or do you feel lost in the vortex of nightmares
Liar  I can sense your affection
In whats been feeding on the lies and redemption
Liar  can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died tonight
Can you breathe the filthy air so tell me how it feels
Can you learn to love someone if you cant see what is real
Can you feel the burning fear that tears you up inside
And you don't sleep at night 'cause creatures disembowel all your dreams
Liar  can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died tonight
Liar  can you answer what is the truth
'Cause something died tonightWe couldn't realise how far
They would go this time
An unforeseen future is
What we must deny
It doesn't matter if it's
Coming the right way out
When we are sinking to
The bottom line
My mind is slipping
My mind is slipping away
And I'm left alone in shame
I'm coming
I'm coming alone
Last man standing in
The fields of scorn
So come on
My mind is slipping
My mind is slipping away
And I'm left alone in shame
I'm coming
I'm coming alone
I'm burning
Until I'm gone
Last man standing in
The fields of scorn
Last man standing in
The fields of scorn
Last man standing in
The fields I was born
So come on
These wings won't learn to rise
In the pale and wicked light beneath the skies
Broken blinded you are paralysed
You belong to them who believe they'll be denied
Take my hand just to be my love
The time has come to rise above
The angel now has broken wings
And something to obtain
The day the sun just went away
You're shivering in the dark
When you feel it's coming closer every time
Now the mentor is calling you
Can't you see the flames beyond your fading eyes
Take my hand just to be my love
Be my love just to be the one
Another day another
Face it didn't mean
Anything
It shouldn't happen
This way
Could you neglect to
Show respect and price
Your advice you give
Our kingdom a name
But now you started
The fire maybe
It cannot lead to no good
And now it doesn't seem
Right that we shall
Obey well can't you feel
It too
It's the time it's the place
It's the way we are made
But you never tried to be
The holy one
You will not feel how good
It tastes
This is here this is now
It's the way we go blind
But you will never
Be the right for the
If lack of values
Leads to waste
The burning wheel is rolling faster
I know I feel it's coming now
�cause any day you will have to see it
Wake up it's real and it's loud
They tried to tell you not to listen
They tried to make you understand
They wanted you to be like the masses
They wanted you to be an average man
But now the dark has got you taken
And now the light no longer exists
You feel the pain is growing stronger
Now what you need is an exorcist
I pray for you
For you are not the same
I pray for you
Tomorrow is your day
They tried to tell you not to listen
They tried to make you understand
They wanted you to be like the masses
But now the darkness has changed your plans
You have become the man they fear now
You have been out there in the mist
You feel the pain is growing stronger
Now what you need is an exorcist
Hey Devil what is your plan today
I didn't know that it would be like this
Hey Devil is it never enough for you
Or won't you quit until I'm on my knees
You make it really hurt when everything is doomed
And there's no salvation
I knew a man who lived two thousand years on your lies
Meet the Devil living on the edge of any pain
I didn't know it felt so good to hurt you
The fear is growing stronger
Though you're only half way through the game
When love is dead I'll call for you
The devil
Hey Devil am I the chosen one
`Cause if I am I think I know the truth
Hey would you enjoy if fanatics won
Without religion you would be no use
In the shadows of evil
Sins cries a little child
She is drawing forbidden things
From the dark side of her mind
She belongs to a different world
A world that is filled with love
Nothing could ever make her sleep
`Cause soon she will have to go
Away
In the shadows of evil
Sins cries a little child
She is waiting for the magic strings
When will they take
Her to the other side
They told her not to be afraid
Of the beasts under her bed
They have become her only friends
Living inside of her head
In the shadows of evil
Sins cries a little child
She is dreaming of her world
Yet still her eyes are open wide
She would dive into the open arms
Of her mentor with the cane
Although she knows she will leave anyway
This will neither be the way
Force out the demons inside
Wake up the evilness
A blood streaming bride
You're standing at the gates of fear
Let yourself crucify
In time for the scare
What if I could be your God
What if I could steal your soul
So come on and let me know
Let me know when you're alone
Bring out the beast in your mind
You are abandoned now
Left here to die
I am your eyes �cause you're blind
And when you're waking up
Your dream is alive
Could it be that you're feeling down again
Could it be that you're crawling faster
Can you bring back the dead
You are seeing the visions from the past
You are here to join us soon
And make it forever last
We are so beautiful
We are so cold
One day you'll join us
Or you will forever long
Could it be that wanna go before
Could it be that you love the thought
Of not being anymore
If you dare come and watch the sight
Of a crowd immortalised
Marching in the night
I've been away for a while now
I have been gone in myself
Time has deranged my emotions
And I I have fought against my hell
Do you wish to be invincible
Do you wish to rule the world
Long before you even think of this
You must learn to rule yourself
I've been afraid of the outside
I am so safe here alone
Life has become my own cell now
Before I leave I just want you to know
We are the ones and now we have
Opened your eyes to see the dark
We are the ones and when we are
Gone we remain unknown for some
But you know by then
It's too late to mendWankele wielen langs donkere gracht
Hoefgekletter van paardekracht
In het donker van de nacht
Ridders in al hun pracht 
Allen dood zult gij zijn
Man vrouw kinderkijn
Speel nu vast de tamboerijn
Eer zal overwinning en vreugde zijn 
Vlaamse boeren zijn gedood
In het donkere avondrood
Wie al dit bloed vergoot
Zal gewroken worden hogenood
Laatste moed vergaard
Naast zijn sterke zwarte paard 
Dienen ridder net nog held
Zal nu sterven op het veld 
Geen dwaas staat hem nog bi 
Asgard is nu zeer nabi
Riddersdroom a priori 
Bleef het zwaard ten einde trouw
Klauwaards tonen geen berouw 
Geen dwaas staat hem nog bi 
Zwarte wolven op de loer
Jongen huilen achter voer 
Zinen dolk vond in zin hart een weg
Heimdall ik ben reeds onderweg
Witten voorschoot van satijn
Maagd weet waar zi moet zijn
Zi deed haar beste kleren aan
Om naar Halewyn te gaan
Zi besteeg het witte ros
En vertrok toen naar het bos
Toen zi zag heer Halewyn
Liette zi heur nekke zien
Het verliep anders dan verwacht
Kinderkijn o Kinderkijn
Zocht gi soms min Halewyn
Geen maagd die haar nek nog ontbloot
Ik heb zin hoofd in mienen schoot
Roden voorschoot rood van bloed
Maagd weet waar zi wezen moet
Zi gaat houden een banket
Waar men het hoofd op tafel zet
Gaart nu allen rond dit vuur
Yggdrasil kan komen ieder uur
Verzoent U allen voor de strijd
Houdt ons van de dood bevrijd 
3014 jaar van de dood
Merlijn is fout indien hij dit besloot 
Wij trollen hebben al de macht
Over deze groene pracht 
Deze wouden zijn van ons
Aanhoort ons luide hartgebons 
Vuur wind zee
Strijden met ons mee 
Dat gedrocht dat wordt vermoord
Njord hebt gij ons gebeden aanhoord
De nieuwe adel geniet volop
Van de mensen zonder brood
De nieuwe plebs is reeds geboren
De piramide nog vergroot 
De pest heeft men reeds onderdrukt
Ziektes kan men nu de baas
De wanhoop is gebleven
De mens nog even dwaas 
Een donkere eeuw herbegon
Maar komt aan dees een eind
Het woud fluisterd mij toe
Ja als wrede mens verdwijnt
Wanneer de nacht haar intree doet
Betreedt geen sterveling nog dit veld
Ketters vervullen laatste wens
Opgeknoopt tot aan de dood 
E Dominus Patrus
Sanctus Vibisdum 
Galgen tot aan de horizon
Een silhouet van razernij
De dauw doorweekt het moordend strop
De kilte van Zonsondergang 
De beul verdringt gewetenspijn
In den herberg naast den eik
Hij verbergt zijn zwarte kap
Veilig bij zijn dikke pens
Een kar betreedt het galgenvel
Het is het circus van de dood
Hier is niemand die hen zoekt
De angst van speurders is te groot
Hier slaan wij onze tenten op
En rusten uit tot morgenvroeg
Dwergen spelen in de moor
De minestreel zingt zacht een lied
Bloed stroomde onder zin ranke stam
En heeft 's mans gezicht verkild
Heur schoone leden nu verstild
Nadat zi droevig bi him kwam 
Schuchtige takken in de wind
Kom bi mi gi vrouw'lik kind
Ik ben wat gi altijd woudt
Schreew niet meer 
Hi had zin wensch vervuld
Die twaalf schepsels
Het licht ontnomen
De duisternis geschonken 
Schichtige takken in de wind
'T is aan mi nu zeer bemind
Vrome vrouwen zijdt gij
'T is aan mi
Op dienen beruchten dag braken zi het ridderwoord
'T is daarom dat zi allen zijn belust op wraak en moord
Het onderdrukte Vlaanderen gooit af zin juk
Ten einde strijd wi zullen dansen van geluk 
Ten velde zin zi reeds vergaard
Hun leven is verbeurd verklaard
Verzonken in hun slaap van 't kwaad
Onze vrijheid gaat in het bloed gebaad 
Met Breydel onzen groten held
Mengen wi ons in het strijdgeweld
Leliaerts worden niet meer gediend
Zo laat hun zeggen schild en vriend 
Wat Waals is vals slaat al dood
Onze bijlen zin bebloedend rood
En onder het luiden van de grote klok
Bevrijden wi onszelve van boze wrok 
Festa deï per francos dat is voorbij
Gedaan met Vlaamsche vleïerij
Bloedzuigers van het Franse hof
Zullen vergaan tot as en stof
T'is mi al eens nor wor gi goat
Als gi ons huize mor ni verloat
Om te goan nor van wie men zegt
Dat mensch dat tegen alles vecht 
Op een doods verlaten pad
Leeft zi alleen met haren kat
Op haren kop nen zwarten hoed
Een meute belust op wraak en bloed 
Diep verscholen in het woud
Is het woar zi zich bezig houdt
Lavendelkruid en rozemarijn
De speurtocht zal al bezig zijn 
En wat te doen als men haar vindt
Zi zal branden in de wind
Zi is de bron van alle kwaad
Het gepeupel is vervuld van haat 
Den duvel is haar metgezel
Boze gedaantes van de hel
Hoort de priesters met de hoge staf
Hun dreigend hondengeblaf 
Brengt dat mensch naar onzen troon
Zi zal krijgen heur verdiende loon
Zo zal schrijen van de pijn
Haar assen zullen de onzen zijn
Verlaten door haar metgezel
Worp zi zichzelf naar beneen
Haren geest leeft boven een rots
De legende van de Lorelei 
Boven op de klippen des doods
Zingt zi bekoorlijk haar eigen lied
Zi lokt de schippers in de mist
Haar blonde haren in de wind 
Het kraken van het brekend hout
Moords gesluimer in de nacht
En bij het ontwaken van de dag
Is er enkel nog het wrak
Getooid in bladergroen en mos
Verrijst hoog boven 't duistere bos
Vantussen mist en ochtenddauw
Kille muren grijs en grauw 
Nen burcht overschaduwd door haat
Verwoest door Fransen hand
Ruïnes bezeten van 't kwaad
Zi maakten heur van kant 
Toen zi haren bloed vergoten
Werd hun geluk verbroken
Oh de mooie Midone
Zo is de legende begonne 
Nu reeds vijfhonderd jaren later
Spookt de dame zoals men beweerd
Hoort haar ijselijk geschater
Als zi de dorpelingen ambeteerd 
Bij 't licht van den bleken maan
Is zi weer uit 't graf opgestaan
En bij nacht en ontij
Sterveling gewaarschuwd zijt gij
We wachten tot wij sterven gaan
Het leven is voor ons gedaan
We leven in afzondering
We worden elkanders vreemdeling 
Afgezonderd in een grot
Zonder liefde of genot
Onder een helse beproeving van ons geluk
Torsen wij dit zware juk 
Verafschuw eigen vlees en bloed
In ons is het dat de pest reed broedt
Geef ons wat drinken of wat brood
Ons wacht alleen de zwarte dood 
Houdt kort de tijd die ons nog rest
Voor ons is de levensdorst gelest
Healed by metal 
Healed by metal
I'm walking on water
Change water to wine
I'm the healer
I'll send you a sign
I change dust into bones
Raise the dead to life
I fight the disease
Come and pray on your knees
We all break out in rage
We're ready for the stage
We live like a rebel
We're all sent by the devil
We are
Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal
The blind will see
And the deaf will hear
The dumb will speak
And the lame will walk
We are the law
We are still mesmerized
Leave the fear behind
We save the human kind
We all break out in rage
We're ready for the stage
We live like a rebel
We're all sent by the devil
We are
Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal
Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal 
Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal
Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal 
Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal
Healed by metal
We rock
Healed by metal 
Healed by metal
Hell awaits at midnight
Fires in the moonlight
Thunder sound from everywhere
Days of anguish and despair
Dark clouds in the sky
In the streets people cry
Hiding in the shadows
There will be no tomorrow
All my saints are gone
All my brothers lost their lives
All my memories turned to black
Heroes fall and war is back
When night falls
I die for you
When night falls
You'll die for me
When night falls
We die side by side
Nothing can divide us
When night is falling down
When night falls
When night falls
Towers at the dark horizon
Gates will open sun and rising
A oneway ticket to hell
Good bye to life a last farewell
Trails of tortured victims
Punished by the system
Will never see the light of day
Suicide is the only way 
All my saints are gone
All my brothers lost their lives
All my memories turned to black
Heroes fall and war is back
When night falls
I die for you
When night falls
You'll die for me
When night falls
We die side by side
Nothing can divide us
When night is falling down
All my saints are gone
All my brothers lost their lives
All my memories turned to black
Heroes fall and war is back
When night falls
I die for you
When night falls
You'll die for me
When night falls
We die side by side
Nothing can divide us
When night is falling down
When night falls
When night falls
When night falls
We love the way we live
We are so hot can't get enough
We hang around and cool down
We ride our bikes through your town
Hundred pounds of metal
Steaming through the shattered night
Roaring wheels cry out for battle
Magic stars our guardian light
Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
Lawbreaker
Don't look back and live fast
Never look back into the past
You will never walk alone
One day our names are carved in stone
Hundred pounds of metal
Steaming through the shattered night
Roaring wheels cry out for battle
Magic stars our guardian light
Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
Lawbreaker
Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
Lawbreaker
Hundred pounds of metal
Steaming through the shattered night
Roaring wheels cry out for battle
Magic stars our guardian light
Lawbreaker
Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
Lawbreaker
Lawbreaker
I am the lawbreaker
Free forever
From a land of snow and ice
Leaving a place like paradise
Living the dreams of the past
We follow the sun home at last
A march of madness without return
At the horizon fires still burn
We give him the last escort
His death was our last resort
Darkness is our fate
We will die for the brave
The spirit of king will never die
On wings of freedom he rides the sky
He wants to live now or never
His legacy will be free forever
Free forever
We awake with eyes wide open
Believing this nightmare never ends
Is this truth or imagination
Savior of a whole generation 
Darkness is our fate
We will die for the brave
The spirit of king will never die
On wings of freedom he rides the sky
He wants to live now or never
His legacy will be free forever
The spirit of king will never die
On wings of freedom he rides the sky
He wants to live now or never
His legacy will be free forever
Free forever
Free forever
Free forever
From the mountains to the sea we hear the battle cries
Enemies not far away we're standing side by side
Freedom  we won't give up we never walk alone
We hold our shields high in the sky never surrender till we die
We ride into the sun
We never hide and never run
We all call for war  no fear of life and death
We all call for war  fight till your last breath
We call for war
Sparks fly high when steel meets steel we send them straight to hell
Spirit of the grave with us we take our last farewell
We ride into the sun
We never hide and never run
We all call for war  no fear of life and death
We all call for war  fight till your last breath
We call for war
We all call for war  no fear of life and death
We all call for war  fight till your last breath
We call for war
In the dark of the night
I kill the rhythm smash the beat
I rise my fist get down on your knees
In the dark of the light
I stand with you side by side
Come and fight with me night by night
Hell over me hell over you
Keep the faith and stay true
In the heat of the day
We rise the flag and cry out loud
We hold our heads up strong and proud
At the summit of rock
We break the chains and trust our hearts
We feel the power nothing tear us apart
Hell over me hell over you
Keep the faith and stay true
Stay true
What do you think who we are
Disciples of Satan or something bizarre
For what do you think we fight this battle
We follow the ten commandments of metal
Hell over me hell over you
Keep the faith and stay true
Stay true
What do you think who we are
Disciples of Satan or something bizarre
For what do you think we fight this battle
We follow the ten commandments of metal 
Stay true
Stay true
Stay true
A man without name
A grave without corpse
A song without tunes
No signs in the runes
I feel the hate
When I come too late
I see the blood stain
In his face again
What's done is done when the reaper will come
Graves are open and souls are broken
Hey hey the hangman's eye
Hang your head high in the sky
Death death will never lie
Let me live or let me die
The hangman's eye
Gallows prepared
All rules are declared
My heart bleeds no longer
And I try to survive
Cry out for the rope
Trust in fear and hope
No rest for the sinner
Death is just a beginner
What's done is done when the reaper will come
Graves are open and souls are broken
Hey hey the hangman's eye
Hang your head high in the sky
Death death will never lie
Let me live or let me die
The hangman's eye the hangman's eye 
Hey hey the hangman's eye
Hang your head high in the sky
Death death will never lie
Let me live or let me die
The hangman's eye
Hey hey the hangman's eye
Hang your head high in the sky
Death death will never lie
Let me live or let me die
The hangman's eye the hangman's eye the hangman's eye
Can't wait to touch you
I watch you night by night
My blood red starring eyes
Watch you move perverse delight
In my dreams I follow you
I watch your steeps in the light
You feel my cold cruel breath
But I'm out of sight
Swear you love me
And you will survive
All my life
It just feels right
Now it's time to bleed
Satisfaction guaranteed
Killing is so beautiful
Dying screams so lyrical

Dying is no miracle

I was born to love you
Don't run and hide
My fingers touch your soul
My mind's out of control
I took my knife slit your neck
Ready for the last attack
What have I done
Took your life in the midnight sun 
Swear you love me
And you will survive
All my life
It just feels right
Now it's time to bleed

You touch my body you touch my soul
You are the devil disguise
You pray to god you praise the devil
You are the effigy of evil
Behind your face you ever lie
When you touch me I can't cry
Your words still hurt you are a liar
Burn in hell you bloody friar
Hallelujah hallelujah
For your sins you will be crucified
Hallelujah hallelujah
All my life I praised the day you will die
Hallelujah hallelujah
You broke my bones you broke my body
I hate you more than my own life
Deep in my mind I hardly suffer
I will eat twice at your last supper
Hallelujah hallelujah
For your sins you will be crucified
Hallelujah hallelujah
All my life I praised the day you will die
Hallelujah hallelujah 
Hallelujah hallelujah
For your sins you will be crucified
Hallelujah hallelujah
All my life I praised the day you will die
Hallelujah hallelujah
I'm sitting at the gates
I'm waiting for the poor lost souls
Hades king of darkness waits
When the last bell tolls
Whispers in the wind
Shattered clouds above the sea
Guardians of the underworld
There's no one left alive but me
In towers of sorrow
We wait for revelation
Sentinels of secrets
Hidden down below
Laughing with the dead oho  oho
Laughing with the dead hahahahaha
On walls of infinity
I'm waiting for their misery
Look behind dark curtains
They carry on the burden
In towers of sorrow
We wait for revelation
Sentinels of secrets
Hidden down below
Laughing with the dead oho  oho
Laughing with the dead hahahahaha
Laughing with the dead oho  oho
Laughing with the dead hahahahaha
In towers of sorrow
We wait for revelation
Sentinels of secrets
Hidden down below
Laughing with the dead oho  oho
Laughing with the dead hahahahaha
Laughing with the dead oho  oho
Laughing with the dead hahahahaha
Laughing with the dead
Laughing with the dead
Laughing with the dead
Laughing with the dead
Cruel times war times
Senseless killing without end
Thousands die in trenches
And bullets kill my friend
No water for the living
No graves for the dead
No faith to leave this hell
Flee this evil spell
In this moment I feel no pain
Only fear to lose my mind
I think about you again and again
Before I'm going blind
We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end
We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end
Many falling day by day
Dying is the only way
Brothers pass before my eyes
No one hears my useless cries
No faces in the mirror
Skulls without pride
Hope is far away and dead
God is buried by my side
In this moment I feel no pain
Only fear to lose my mind
I think about you again and again
Before I'm going blind
We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end 
We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end 
War is the devil war is the devil war is the devil
The evil of mankind
In this moment I feel no pain
Only fear to lose my mind
I think about you again and again
Before I'm going blind
We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end 
We are the kingdom of the night
We never see the light
We are fighting the world
Losing all our friends
War is the devil
We'll fight till the end
Around the world in thirty days
I need no help get of my way
Harder faster nothing to lose
I believe I got the walkin' blues
God is a liar
Devil's friar
Burn in the fire
Life's my desire
Good bye my friend
I got the Judas kiss
Come with me check my bucket list
Good bye my friend
I raise my fist
Countdown for my bucket list
Hurry up no time to waste
So many things I wanna taste
Reaper's call surprised and scared me
My fortune's gone I've lost the key 
God is a liar
Devil's friar
Burn in the fire
Life's my desire
Good bye my friend
I got the Judas kiss
Come with me check my bucket list
Good bye my friend
I raise my fist
Countdown for my bucket list
God is a liar
Devil's friar
Burn in the fire
Life's my desire
Good bye my friend
I got the Judas kiss
Come with me check my bucket list
Good bye my friend
I raise my fist
Countdown for my
Good bye my friend
I got the Judas kiss
Come with me check my bucket list
Good bye my friend
I raise my fist
Countdown for my bucket list
In my dreams I hear your voice
I see your face next to mine
Far away a silent call
Immortal songs of rise and fall
As a falcon you will fly
Can't believe that you died
An arrow hit your chest
Forced your body down to rest
The world turns round and round
When rain starts falling down
A last farewell
In the blood red sunset
Times we never will forget
The brave young and innocent
Cold winds surround my soul
Demons try to take control
I'm lost in the endless grey
I lope that you'll come back one day
When storm comes up I face the battle
Call the gods for absolution
In my heart I stand the fear
Words of wisdom I can hear
The world turns round and round
When rain starts falling down
A last farewell
In the blood red sunset
Times we never will forget
The brave young and innocentDressed in leather dressed in chains
Full of agression full of pains
Stage is open light comes up
Metal kids go mad
Count  down is on for the band
Drunken women drunken men
Show their hands for fucking arse
They bang their heads
He's a man he's a kid
Wanna bang with you
Headbanging man
He's man he's a kid
Wanna bang with you
Headbanging man
Metal music blows your heads
And metal maniacs bang to death
The air roars like a machine gun
Banging devils on the run
The show is over kids are gone
And fucking people lay alone
Drun too much they're falling down
It's a headbanging crown
He's a man he's a kid
Wanna bang with you
Headbanging man
He's a man he's a kid
Wanna bang with you
Headbanging with you
Headbanging man
Metal invasion that's all what we need
Metal dominion that's all what we want
We come to give you rules and principles
What you have to do
We come to shake your hands and legs
As fast as we can do
Heavy Metal Breakdown
Women and children want to hear the noise
Women and children want to feel the beat
Bang your heads as fast as you can
Until you're breaking down
The night is long the show is right
Bang until you die
Heavey Metal Breakdown
Shake your legs and bang your heads
Heavey Metal Breakdown
Bloody legs and bloody hands
Bloody necks and bloody heads
A smell of sulphur lays over me
A smell of mould also too
What I see I know it's true
A battlefield strewed with dead bodies
Awful sight please give me peace
Deliver me from evil's work
Is it a dream or is it real
Is it illusion or reality
I'm a man
Not an armed murderer
I must leave this state of terror
I must run far far away
Please hear my call I must leave now
I tell no lies that's not a joke
Back from the war
Lay down to the ground
Back from the war
Lay down to the grount
You don't believe so march to fight
You're gonna die like the other men
I'm a man
Not a devil's soldier
I'm a man
Not an armed murderer
I must leave this state of terror
I must run far far away
Please let us live live without war
Please keep the peace the peace of the world
Yesterday when you left me on my own
Yesterday when you left my heart alone
Yesterday no yesterday no no
Yesterday when your love was very true
Yesterday when we knew what to do
Yesterday no yesterday no
Yesterday in my mind it's still alive
Yesterday when we were husband and wife
Yesterday no yesterday no

Watch out watch out

We are back now
Watch out watch out
What you feel is it real
We are back now
The gates of hell are open
The night of the wolf is broken
The signs of madness are shining
The sun of devil is rising
They're marchng through the night
They're searching for bread
They're infected with plague
They're infected with death
They know they have to die
And the end is a grave
They shout into the dark
It's a cry in the night
Marching for freedom marching for life
Searching for love
But they don't wanna die
Don't walk to heaven don't walk to hell
There's no escape for the legion
Of the lost legion of the lost
Legion of the lost legion of the lost
They're marching on and on
There's no place to hide
They're living in fear oh god can't you see
Their eyes are full of tears they've started to run
Now they reach the end the end of the way
Marching for freedom marching for life
The lifion of the lost
Lost horizons everywhere
The sun is grey and dark
A coach runs through the shattered night
Without a tone
Four winds howl into the night
It's cold and wet
Horses black and danerous
Horror runs my blood
Tyrant
The beast comes to kill us
The beast comes to kill us
The beast comes to kill us
The beast comes to
Magic world's around my soul
Desaster's burning high
He's the son of heaven's devil
He's the arm of death
Don't look back don't look back
You can lose your life
Tyrant sees every step every step you make
Shape your eyes and watch them burn
There's always fire 'round the night
I want to grown into yourself
Wiping out the wise below
Watch you change into a star
I want to gaze into a mirror
Shape your eyes and watch them burn
There's always fire 'round the night
Always fire where you're going to
Heart attack heart attack
Heart attack heart attack
Watch your eyes and watch them burn
Fire's always 'round with you
I want to grow into your soul
Shape your eyes and watch them burn
There's always fire 'round the night
I want to crawl into a mirror
Wipeing out the wise below
What you know it's you're alone
I remember everybody too
Heart attack
Watch your eyes and watch them burn
There's fire always 'round with you
I want to burn into yourself
Shape your eyes and watch them burn
There's always fire 'round the night
I want to crawl into yourdoor
Shape your eyes and watchthem burn
There's always fire 'round the night
'Member what you'd always going to
What you blow is always fire
Where you're bend you're still alone
Always fire 'part from that it's true
Heart attackRise my trooprs rise again
Full of hope for another feast
Centuries has passed since you last
Tasted the sweet blood of the living
Better beware when daylight breaks
The spell of killing spree is reversed
So take your pick there is plenty for all
For one night we rule their domain
Out of our coffins out of our homes
We are driven by the instinct to feed
Driven by the most basic need
As the calls us we will rise
Rise from your tombs
Into the night
As black as your hearts
And now that you're back
Back from the grave
You wont be saved
Born a saint died in sin
So the holy one won't let us in
Soon to come our final feast
As our master calls the angels weep
Rise from your tombs
Into the night
As black as your hearts
And now that you're back
Back from the grave
You wont be saved
Soon another night has passed by
And our troops have grown stronger again
From the blood of the fortunate ones
That now join us eternally
Dawn of creation for the second time
Sin or salvation which one will it be
Meet the one who they call the fallen one
Rules reserved now as evil is in command
Sin or salvation
Feel no sympathy
For the ones left behind
Their times is soon to come
Ignore the one who they call their saviour
Rule reversal under my command
As the night falls
Take your first breath
Behold the flames
As the world burns
Wasn't it worth it to die
Better on the dark side
No preachers and masses and lies
Never more look to the sky
As the night falls
Take your first breath
Behold the flames
As the world burns
Now that you've seen our side
Can you return to the lie
Wasn't it worth it to fry
Rid all the troubles of fire
But they told you Jesus is still alive
Angel choirs versus angels' cries
Should not be a problem to decide
Are you in or out
I am reborn I have seen the light
I was lost but now I'm found
Judgement Day is soon to come
Sinners beware and bow down
I see them in the streets
Speaking to no one
Weak in their mind and weak in their hearts
So convincing to themself
I've seen the truth Dead is better
Than living in a selfcreated dream
Let me guide you down
Path #666
Through the portals of damnation
Prepare to taste the virgin's blood
Darkness surrounds you as we part
Your body from your soul
I have seen the truth Dead is better
Than to live in a state of dreams
Now you're reborn but now by the light
Tormented screams is now your mass
Now admit taht our salvation
Has more to offer that Paradise
Through the portals of damnation
Prepare to taste the virgin's blood
Darkness surrounds you as we part
Your body from your soul
Hell is only a word
Reality is much much worse
Your life has got no end
There's no exception tonight
For the prophecy to come true
Human sacrifice we need
Blindfold will make it easier for you as we proceed
Bloodstained your white shroud will be bloodstained when we are done
Prepare for pain and pleasure
As the demons do their deed
So the unborn can be brought to
Our eternity
Blindfold will make it easier for you as we proceed
Bloodstained your white shroud will be bloodstained when we are done
Demon semen
Brings life eternal
Behold the beauty
In the spawn of Satan
For the unholy one to succeed
The purest soul is used to conceive
Your life has got no end
There's no exception tonight
Prepare for pain and pleasure
As the dark one delivers
Demon semen
Brings life eternal
Behold the beauty
In the spawn of Satan
Damn the ones who put me here
Four white walls to save my soul
I will not deny what I have done
But to me it is normal not a crime
Stripping flesh from the bone
Tearing limb from limb
Eyes that no longer see
Is a feast for me
So I suffer quietly
Let them try to figure my inside out
Maybe I should give them a taste
Human flesh converts the most doubtful mind
Stripping flesh from the bone
Tearing limb from limb
These are things that I do
To feel satisfied
No more tears falling from my eyes
No regrets no repent
I decide who will live or die
In my world I am god
Now they can't hurt me no more
Since my body is just an empty shell
I have left in search for
Another body to inhabit for a while
No more tears falling from my eyes
No regrets no repent
I decide who will live or die
In my world I am god
I thought that you would appreciate me
Just tried to keep you for eternity
First time failure is seems to me
The thought was not to make you bleed
Seemed like a good plan to prolong your life
Covered with chemicals since your last breath
I've been trying to preserve you
To bring you back into my life
Dreams of eternity
Turned you into morbidity
I can not undo this pain
That I've caused you
Flesh begins to rot and peel away
Resurrection of your body has failed
As you feel your life drain away
The sound of death is ringing in your head
All my dreams are shattered
How shall I proceed
I thought that you would appreciate me
Covered with chemicals since your last breath
I've been trying to preserve you
The thought was not to make you bleed
Flesh begins to rot and peel away
Resurrection of your body has failed
As you feel your life drain away
The sound of death is ringing in your head
From the darkest depths of hell
Spawn of evil is set free
Domination since the dawn of time
Soulhunter will prevail again
The only angels you'll ever see
Will be the dark ones  Below
Trying to please the holy one
See what that has brought you to
Live by the book live by the lies
The purest souls is what we crave
Step into the flames
You are our guest for eternity
No use to look to the skies
Clench your hands one last time
Domination for eternity
Soulhunter has prevailed again
No way out of here
Trapped in a vacuum between the living and the dead
I hear them call me from the other side
Disbelieve I have been my whole life
Guide my soul to rest
Who will decide my faith
Some say the body will decompose and turn to dust
Spirits appear in front of me
Reaching for my mind to decide
And I choose to be
Bloodfed  not misled
Not sacred  or Godled
You drink the blood of Christ
I drink the blood of you
I would not have it any other way
Back with the dead again
Since my first visit it has now come clear
Rather that spend my afterlife among the praying
I'd rather be
Bloodfed  not misled
Not sacred  or Godled
Seeking the answers to my state of mind
Can I go on with the demons inside
Trying to rid of these thoughts
The urge to kill for pleasure is so strong
So I do it again
Nothing else seems to mind
Blood on my hands and blood on my mind
That's the way that I spend my days
The war that rages inside of me
Is always won by the dark half of me
So I do it again
Cause they told me again
Never will I spare your feeble life
On your knees they will find you
Thorn to pieces
Never will I shed a tear for you
Or the ones yet to come
War against those who cross my path
War against those who deny the dark
Blood on my hands and blood on my mind
As I hunt down the next one in line
Never will I spare your feeble life
On your knees they will find you
Thorn to pieces
Never will I shed a tear for you
Or the ones yet to come
Death has sent it's angels
Heralds of war pain and fear
In sunlight or darkness of night
Sinister tyrants of cruelty
On their black horses travel all over the world
Scepters of fear and banners of chaos 
And cry of the beast breaking the empty space
When fright and terror start to rule
Demons of war tyrants of cruelty
Cry through abyss
Bad day for those who heard this cry
Shadow in valleys
Rumble and roll and wild laugh of horses
Soon thirsty they will drink from rivers of blood
In flames of fire and bloody glow
Among dead corpses in deadly fight
Damned day when thousand swords
With rumble will sing their song of death
In blood and corpses of the enemy
Cruel triumph and gloomy fame
March of victory tyrants
Lords of war with ghostly laugh
Will reward the bravest warriors
Because where death rules
And angles of death
Only few will survive
Damned day gloomy day
When rage of beast of fear as gray shadow
Falls on your lands talking to you
As magic call pulls you
Where many have gone
But no one returned alive
In fire of battle in the ravages of war
Cruel lords' wild laugh
On hatred fields in tumult of battle
In trap of mighty and cruel gloomy will
The wind will steal our names
Damned day when crow on the sky
Flutter it's black wings
Where war track leads
We will go following destiny
For eternal struggle leading by voice of mighty will
Where wind will mix our names with ashes
No mercy in my heart
I was born for war not for love
Rage and voices of my dying enemies
Fill my soul and my heart
War craft is my life
Stern school of life taught me how to fight
Instinct told me what to do
Always watchful always ready
Conscious of bonds of blood
I am waiting for another battlewhen Wotan summons me
Rage is my guide hatred my consolation
When I have to choose I always choose a sword
When death and life becomes the One
Creed of sword must be cruel and unforgiving
In dance with death I delight in cries of the defeated
Staining in blood of the enemy I become herald of cruelty
In bluster of clashing steel I hear my breath
In the eyes full of fear I see reflection of my face
Sword is my thought my voice and my will
No mercy in my heart
Fires of hatred burned it
Bloody streams mark my way
Blood shed in a battle mixes with the soil
Before wild beast come
And mangle dead corpses
I will bury my brothers who died
No room for peace in my heart
I will bear my burden 
Where Gods wage the battles
i will look for soothe in cruelty of war
And in taste of blood
Before rain cleans my wounds
From harden blood and ashes
I will raise my sword
And go where my brothers
Are fighting to their last breath
Hymns of war will fill the empty space
Sound of drums will break the sky
Clashed in deadly hag
We will cry our names to the Eternity
The dead will find their place in Valhalla
And on lands where they waged their battles
Following the voice of blood
The way of our ancestors
Memory of them will live forever
The days when ancient blood
Will awake in the hearts of white men and women
Our banners will rise to the sky
And will flap with joy on wind
Ancient widsom and strength will return
Divided nation will become unity
And cry of thousands of throats
Will disperse darkness
Clearing a way for Swarozyc light
The gates to source of our might
On rushing shining chariots
Heroes of nation will return us our pride
Fire will be brought to life
And will light forever
In it's warm and lights of flames
New generations will be bred
When ancient blood will return us our will
We will not be afraid of darkness any more
And Swarozyc light will disperse the darkness of night
In bloody struggle fighting bravely
Through courage and bravery
Looking into death's eyes
We will join proud heroes
Who with might and main gave their lives away
And belong to the past fighting
For honor and pride of our race
When blood of ours and of our enemies
With falsehood and lies put to sleep
Will awake from a long sleep
In darkness of night swords will shine
And squeal of coming death
WIll bring fear to the enemy
In flames of victory and glory
Words full of honor and pride
Will be brought back to light
In deadly struggle spilling our blood
We will raise banners of victory
Signs of triumph and rebirth
In flames of Swarozyc light
On our defiled soil
When ancient blood
Will awake in us
Spirits of war arrived at the battlefield
His voice echoed with loud sound
Today rains will sprinkle the soil
Today we will meet our death here
Or we will win the name of Wotan
Where Gods summon for deathly combat
We follow as always faithful to fight and war
Among fires and clashing steel
In the flames of rising Swarozyc 
In the battle we will give our lives away
White beasts of Wotan
Bloody faces full of pride
For eons on war in the name of honor and pride
Born among death pain and sadness
Bred in the shadow of swords
And among the sound of war drums
White beasts of Wotan
Blue eyes bringing fright
White hands swaying swords
With Swarozyc on their flags
With cry of hatred on their mouths
Always they're where blood is shed with rivers
White sons of Wotan
Fighting bravely as their fathers used to fight
From dawn till dusk in mortal struggles
Staining with enemy blood
Till the last breathe inflicting deadly blows
In eternal dance with death in chaos of war
Steel is mixing with blood
Honor and pride do not let move back
We go forth winged with anger
Wotan leads us for a battle
Our names frighten the enemy
Akways faithful to cruel law of war
Following the eternal call
Keep straight on listening to their heathenish hearts
Steel shields of Wotan
White beasts
Blades of anger and justice
The sword and fist of WotanInvocation  the blood peers through my veins
I cannot see the face of eyeless hell
Invocation  for the knowledge of the cold
Dark and grey  like a machine
Insanity became reality
All fragments endes embracing time
Releasing shadows as it stops to flow
And slain an amusing lifeless curse
My arms are getting colder
It comes over my shoulder
Something I've never seen
I'm getting to be a machine
My blood stops to flow
My hand  an iron glove
I change my be
I wouldn't be a machine
Incarnation  of a further level n fear
A gracious lefe betrayed by an energetic stream
Incarnation  by powers of the unknown might
The evolution of the human race
Insanity became reality
All fragments endes embracing time
Releasing shadows as it stops to flow
And slain an amusing lifeless curse
Disinfection of information
Instruction failed
Perhaps maybe align
World is changing every day
World is changing every moment
But some little things remain the same
They hurt my mind  a real pain
Look around what you see
Only hate and misery
This world  a poisoned ball
We destroy ourself  so we fall
We have to give our best
But who is changing all the rest
We're jumping the world into a better world
Your help we need today
Forget what you did your mother say
We're jumping the world into a better world
No standing still  madness we kill
We're jumping the world into a better world
All is prepared
We're starting nor the world music show
We're jumping the world into a better world
So come on jump
We have to give our best
But who is changing all the rest
We're jumping the world into a better world
Your help we need today
Forget what you did your mother say
We're jumping the world into a better world
World is changing every day
World is changing every moment
But some little things remain the same
They hurt my mind  a real pain
Look around what you see
Only hate and misery
This world  a poisoned ball
The salvation  today we're gonna jump
Confessions of your mind
After thousand days of killing
Death was my life and pain where my thoughts
Pleasure of the death there is no regret
Boiling in my veins
Another death  another lust
In my eyes there is something wrong
Another life  another soul
Nobody gives a damn
The plague will unleashed and the race will begun
Run for desire for the lust to die
The innocent souls and the smell in the air
Killing  raping  destroying of souls
Watch them cross the line of life
Do not feel the pain inside
Emotions are gone every breath he takes
Take control of their essence of life
Bloodred face of lust
Take the chance do it again
Screaming out for blood
Silence on the overground
Calling the death
Mortals have ceased to be
Motionless stand afraid
One more time my hateful design
Carnal desires the treasure to survive
Watching out for victims visions of a dying world
Screaming bodies surrounded by pain
The neverending ritual will always go on
Once again  another fight
You choose your way to die
Another time  another friend
Let the show start again
My hateful design
1 2 3 4
Stop command
I feel so sick inside
Unused your human mind
Untrue is that you see outside
I knock you out
You never said ''I'm sorry''
You've never been a friend
Important four you success and money
Stop command
The job your family
The sad cruelty
No conversation
No explanation
Even not rich enough
No place for feelings and stupid stuff
Less  I love you
Just more  I hate you
You blind bastard
When did you sell your heart
Don't tell us bullshit
Don't tell us lies
In your part you failed
What you mean Stop
1 2 3 4
Stop command
1 2 3 4
Stop command
Stop
Forget the time forget this place
'cause we are here to damage your face
Just close your eyes
Across the ocean across the land
Mysterious things and the name of a band
Just close your eyes and give me your hand
Are you ready Are you ready
To hear this song for so long
This is our time  believe in me
We're playing you feel free
You hear us everywhere  near and far
In the galaxy  on every star
Just close your eyes
Ready to rumble ready to crash
Today we're gonna smash
Just close your eyes and give me your hand
Give me your faith
So many roads  so many places
A million towns  a milliard faces
It's called world population
But the appropriate name  world domination
Can someone help me
Who should I call
In such time guns are friends
Never ever you see shaking hands
Even childs are making war
So called freedom is away so far
Can someone help me
Who should I call
I want escape I wanna fly
I wanna breath I wanna cry
I'll kill myself therefore and so
I wanna know where I should go
Can someone help me
Who should I call
The population  is gonna fall
I'm asking  for deliverance
Suggest  I wait for a wise sentence
Never ending  I'm dying
Before I stay to try
Inside  outside
Upside and down
Left and right
Before and behind
I prefer to die before the end
Over and under
Are black and white really the same
Hallo Who is there
Split my head into seven parts
What is gonna happen
Rivers flowing upward instead of down
Who moves the earth
Did stones ever grow in this world
Can steel be broken
When did revers start so flow again
The end is open
Who is making facts to facts
The fields of knowledge from inside  outside
Does someone know the beginning
The place where time and space are death
Thinking over and over again
But nothing seems really real
Who the fuck is upside there
And ''earthcommanding''
Hallo Who is there
Who the fuck is upside outside
Hallo Who is there
Why are you ''earthcommanding''
In my world I wanna stay
So I'm running away running away
In my own world I wanna grow
In my mind  in my soul
Just in my own world I wanna feel
That's what deep inside of me
Before I gonna stay to try
That's the truth  prefer to die
Never ending  I'm dying
Before I stay to try
Inside  outside
Upside and down
Left  right
Before  behind
I prefer to die
Split my head into seven parts
Can steel be broken
Ripping forth through the dark and white
The end is open
Hallo Who is there
Hallo Who is there
I'm here to say goodbye
Deepest red born winter day
For no one so dark as night
As the light  faded away
Bring forth the way of life
Where whispers sound like hopeless screams
When you crossed the line of life
Where silence freeze into endless pain
When you stopped to be
I remember the silence night
As you crushed as you crushed away
Why did you leave
Why did you leave my life
Death interrupt what is begun
Take the angel back to the sky
Empty thoughts  hopeless time
Fallen dreams sopped me now
Where whispers sound like hopeless screams
When you crossed the line of life
Where silence freeze into endless pain
When you stopped to be
I remember the silence night
As you crushed as you crushed away
Why did you leave
Why did you leave my life
For one moment in life
Feel the emptiness in my soul
In my breath
In my thought
I tell you why
Oh life is bigger
It's bigger than you
And you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you crying
I thought that I heard you Scream
I think I thought I saw you Die
Every whisper of
Every waking moment I'm
Choosing my confessions
Trying to keep
An eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool
Oh no I've said too much
I set it up
Consider this
Consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this
The slip
That brought me to my knees failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around
Now I've said too much
I thought that I heard you Crying
I thought that I heard you Scream
I think I thought I saw you Die
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
But I don't know if I can do it
Oh no I've said too much
I haven't said enough
I thought that I heard you Crying
I thought that I heard you Scream
I think I thought I saw you Die
But that was just a dream
Die Cry Why Die
That was just a dream
Just a dream
Just a dream
DreamCaught in shadow
Hidden low away from the sun
In the silence
Where the safety is found
Beneath the stones
Within the soil
In the warmth of the ground
They rest their weary heads
From dust until dawn
But as the day breaks
She climbs upstairs
Though the fear surrounds
The taste of the air
And sudden shapes just
Quickly appear
On the northern hill
Not far from here
And all those greedy eyes
And all their eager sighs
As all their howls raised her scare
Setting off
No time to spare
Her sentence was clear
As all their eyes of lust
That held her so dear
Oh you hear them howl
As they come through the woods
Muddy trails and rugged trees and the light in her eyes
She slowly ran along as fast as she could
Beyond the rural safety just too old to supply
She just ran and ran as fast as she could
And all those greedy eyes
And all their eager sighs
As all their howls raised her scare
Setting off
No time to spare
Her sentence was clear
As all their eyes of lust
That held her so dear
Oh you hear them howl
As they come through the woods
They closing in on your path
They are drawn to your blood
Crimson patterns resurrected
On that torn old wooden floor
She gets forced my their hatred
Deep in behind those welllocked doors
And they'll howl howl
Yes they'll howl howl
Jaws are fighting for that pleasure
Dark breath so far from grace
Until all of her is wasted
Crooked silent there she lay
And they'll howl howl
Yes they'll howl howl howl
Oh you hear them howl
As they come through the woods
They closing in on your path
They are drawn to your blood
Allt sedan den dagen då han föll för sitt kall
går allting taktfast mot obeveklig död och förfall
Som en förseglad och förhemligad själ
skrider han sömngångarlikt in i rollen som dödens träl
Slav under rådlöshetens jämmer
 blomstrande till liemannens skörd
Straffet som ingen man bestämmer
 kedjad till trots med sin efterbörd
Ständigt förföljd av samma hopplösa ledmotiv
drömmer han ljuvt om tusen slocknande mänskoliv
Flyktiga år av förtvivlan förmörkade hans fromma jag
och ändå till det bittra slutet skydda han förtappelsens dag
Slav under rådlöshetens jämmer
 blomstrande till liemannens skörd
Straffet som ingen man bestämmer
 kedjad till trots med sin efterbördAnal

Defecator's stench

Anal stench of anus puking reek of putrefaction
The heat of rotting mass so mesmerizing to my soul
The reek of devoured matter so invoking for my mind
Am I a stenchminder or anus inruptor
True stench never dies and the fume must be resorbed
The confecal stench of decomposure I smell the rotting
Exuming the gas of deteriorating necropsy
Stench de nocte so emphatic glaring in the dark
Concentrated intoxicating and nauseating
Stench of anus kult de nocte
Exhemal grind of consumation
Acrid snort
Turns the brain

A sickening asphyxiation
Confecal stench emission

A reason for you too
No matter what you say

Shining bright inside of you
Believe inside of me
Believe inside of you
The wheel of life will turn forever

Science searching for the final answer

Plan of life  inside of us
Forever it will be
This is the masterplan
Never changing  never changing
This is the masterplan
Time you're spending  neverending
Driving up in a big limousine

Big shot  showing off your money

So fucking dumb or just so mean
Ain't gonna say a single word to you

Got all of your fame
But life is lost without a brain
Gonna show you down to the ground
Your fucking lies are all around
You loser

Violence  deep in my veins

Ending  just wait and see

Stardust falls from the sky
Gave us the reason why
Stardust falls from the sky
Brings us to sleep tonight
Feel it  the more you fight
the more you start to lose your mind
Taste it  the bitterness
gets all inside and lets you die
Power  is in the air
and then the night will turn to day
Warning  for us to see
Maybe we stop our own decay
Get on your feet  Get on your feet
Get on your feet
Do what it needs  Do what it needs
Do what it needs

Wanna bite the hand that feeds me
Wanna turn the tides
Set the demons free and let them fly
Strike down the one who leads me
I'm gonna take his place
Gonna vindicate the human race
You better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
Better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
Take the reins of power
And seize them
Draw the battle lines
Armageddon's just a matter of time
Tear down the voice of reason
Let the arrows fly
Your freedom's just a state of mind
Better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
You better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
You better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
You better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
Better watch out
Cause I'm a war machine
I'm a war machine
I'm a war machineRight on the eve of battle
Next to the battleground
Two brothers stood there quietly
Expecting yet the third
Legend tells us of the brothers
Of the Holy Trinity
All for one and once for always
They are unified
Once for truth and once for wisdom
Prophecies and visions fade
Once for love once for horror
Fading in the night
This is not the truth but not a lie
It is no wisdom but a
Right on the eve of battle
Next to the battleground
The third was striding to his kin
United once again
Legend tells us of the brothers
Of the Holy Trinity
All for one and once for always
They are unified
Never linger
Soon you will find the way
Through the never
Sadness will go astray
Lead the way
Harvest the day
Soon you will find your way
Once for truth and once for wisdom
Prophecies and visions fade
Once for love once for horror
Fading in the night
Never linger
Soon you will find the way
Through the never
Sadness will go astray
Lead the way
Harvest the day
Soon you will find your way
Trice denied still believing
Standing up to the world
Three will stand after all is gone
The Holy Brotherhood
Right on the edge of battle
Deep in the battleground
The Trinity is striking back
United once again
Legend tells us of the brothers
Of the Holy Trinity
All for one and once for always
They are unified
The legend tells of brothers
Of the Holy Trinity
All for one and once for always
They are one
Silent the vacuum of time claims all our souls but one
Guild of thieves master of mages noone hears the call
Louder than the one before the greatest king proclaims
Still the lubricant of Toki prophesies the fall
The gods call out to find a hero
Will he find out the new tomorrow
For now I bleed
My destiny
Shall I succeed
Will I be freed
The never forever
Desires more
My body is mourning
But I keep trying
This is not what I felt
In my mind I am free
This is not goodbye
This is my quest but noone knows
If I will do what I'm supposed to
The great walls of time and space are closing everywhere
There on the highway to nothing noone seems to care
Where can I stay
This mournful day
Whom can I pray
What's there to say
Evermore the days are counting selfless suicide
Never will the gods be ready for the genocide
Towards our fate we run together
Forever denying the never
Surrounding us
Memories will keep the greatest
Alive in our minds in our thoughts
Surrounding us
Ever had
A memory
You wished
It could come true
The memory
So close to me
Will never fade
It's how I paid
The gift of sight
Vision of light
My Master's will
The dream fulfilled
In this tragedy
My only friend is a lie
The thoughts
Are all surrounded
By darkest clouds
I sing to
My soul reveals
It's a battle
I could never win
I should lose
Never believed
For none they grieved
Do they not know
We do not bow
The nightmares last but
Stay in the past
Why do they taunt
These thoughts I haunt
Our only dream
As we have seen
Will be revealed
Our fate be healed
Noone to say
The only way
The one of tears
Our greatest fears
Some day they will see
The curse that lies on me is real
For this day I yearn
Their innocence will burn with me
It's as we have foreseen
Our hands will be washed clean of guilt
In time we will be freed
For noone else we'll bleed this lie
When silent screams resound
Our fear will be unbound at last
For this day we yearn
Their innocence will burn with me
For this day we yearn
Their innocence will burn with me
It was for you
All that was true
For this ending shall not come
In my heart you belong
Makes me weak makes me strong
Feels like dying though I belong
Fear all the thoughts I had
My memories became more than that
My tears keep on flowing
The wind keeps on blowing
Forever you are
Deep within it is so clear
Where it begins can't we just be near
I keep on searching
The next thing that's lurking
Forever you are me
All I have now
Is my sad cry
Should I wonder what shall come
All the lies beyond the secret's fading
My own mind becomes a dreadful trap
For you came to me strangely behaving
Maybe all of this is to forget
Fear all the thoughts I had
My memories became more than that
My tears keep on flowing
The wind keeps on blowing
Forever you are
Deep within it is so clear
Where it begins can't we just be near
I keep on searching
The next thing that's lurking
Forever you are me
All the lies beyond the secret's fading
My own mind becomes a dreadful trap
For you came to me strangely behaving
Maybe all of this is to forget
All the lies beyond the secret's fading
Maybe all of this is to forget
For you came to me strangely behaving
My own mind becomes a dreadful trap
Once upon a lifetime
Never far away
Once upon a lifetime
It leads you astray
On your path to glory
It takes you by surprise
On your path to glory
You will meet your demise
How
Should I
Know
What I will see
What I will think
What I'll be feeling
Should I embrace this vision
Should I despise these thoughts
Should I despise this vision
Should I embrace these thoughts
I will acknowledge your voice
I will concede
I will acknowledge your voice
I will pay heed
Can't see is there
No
Way for me
Can't I flee
Am I
Free
I can't see
Won't I be
Is there
No
Way for me
Can't I flee
Am I free
I can't see
Won't I be
I am
Dreams unfold as days go by
And stars stand brightly in the sky
I will never say goodbye
'cause this will last until I die
I will embrace this vision
I won't despise these thoughts
I won't despise this vision
I will embrace these thoughts
I will acknowledge your voice
I will concede
I will acknowledge your voice
I will pay heed
Quietly but always watching
Hidden in the night
Eagerly waiting the morrow
Hidden from your sight
Spotted only in your dreams
But nevertheless there
Lurking back from out your vision
Never seem to care
Repelled only by a knife
Their kind will bring you fear
Follow not their song in darkness
it Leads away from here
Female faeries frightful horrors
Riding on the storm
Luring travellers away
In their hideous form
They are forever
They're standing side by side
Running together
And staying out of sight
They are forever
They're standing side by side
Running together
And staying out of sight
Semblance of a poor old woman
In ashcoloured clothes
Apron thrown across the shoulder
But it's you she loathes
Now too late to cry
Out in the meadows we will fly
Running away to wonder why
We die inside
Now too late to cry
Out in the meadows we will fly
Running away to wonder why
We die inside
They are forever
They're standing side by side
Running together
And staying out of sight
They are forever
They're standing side by side
Running together
And staying out of sight
Now too late to cry
Out in the meadows we will fly
Running away to wonder why
We die inside
Now too late to cry
Out in the meadows we will fly
Running away to wonder why
We die inside
I saw a thing I could never believe
A distant sight I would like to retrieve
It is a vision my mind will set free
If I could remember how it came to be
The image is fading it withers away
I can't be sure that I'll take grasp some day
Deep in my heart I know that's what I seek
But somehow I wonder to whom does it speak
Memories lost in a nightmare of pain
Images screaming you're going insane
Never believed in it till it was gone
It is as a dreamworld the magic undone
It never strayed my thoughts my soul's so weak
What I despised most is now what I seek
My heart still craving for that I once held
Hopelessly longing for all this to end
Hear you call my name
Am I dreaming
It's always the same
Though I know
That I lost myself
Tonight
Maybe the truth shall reveal
When I sleep
Visions attack in my head
And so I weep
Calling the light from within
It might be cruel
Lately no vision's the same
Whom do I fool
All the lights might seem the same
Though it's as they call my name
Feel like something's watching me go down fall in a trap
Seek the world out for a chance
But it seems to miss the glance
This is harder than I thought
Can't you see what's on my mind
All the visions fall behind
Try to catch them but it's like I'm trying to escape
All the anger that I gain
Makes me yearn to be insane
This is not my state of mind
See me wandering in the darkest deep of shadows
The world above so bright my dearest enemy
Where once lived happiness where sorrow couldn't bear
But I am drowning here too far to even care
See me wandering alone and cold and bare
My deepest memories no grief no sadness there
It's dark and cold in here in this forgotten lair
Loneliness prevails how could I ever dare
I can't pray for mercy 'cause there's no soul to hear
So I stay here helpless in my remains of sense
There's no place for regret 'cause only I am here
So I remain helpless behind this solid fence
Hear me muttering of long forgotten times
My head is bursting with long and brutal chimes
Still can see the past a road enclosed by limes
But haunting through my head are black distorted rhymes
Hear me muttering about my dreadful debt
I can't remember why so long my soul has slept
Immortal my regret endless have I wept
No tears will wash away the secret I have kept
I can't pray for mercy 'cause there's no soul to hear
So I stay here helpless in my remains of sense
There's no place for regret 'cause only I am here
So I remain helpless behind this solid fence
Can't you see why I am weeping
can't you see that I repent
No one knows the pain that I feel
no one knows just what I meant
Years will come and years will pass but
I can't leave this unlocked cell
Leaves will grow and leaves will fall but
endless is this living hell
There's no soul that lives in darkness
no soul knows eternal pain but
My soul will forever perish
evermore 'till I'm insane
I can't pray for mercy 'cause there's no soul to hear
So I stay here helpless in my remains of sense
There's no place for regret 'cause only I am here
So I remain helpless behind this solid fence
Let me grab my battleaxe
And I will kill you
Let me grab my spear
And thrust it through your heart
You will rot in fear
When I walk near
Fear's with my spear
Your death is here
Plague the faces
Rotting corpses
Axes swords and evil forces
I have lived a life of sorrow
Death I follow
Die tomorrow
Plague the faces
Rotting corpses
Axes swords and evil forces
I have lived a life of sorrow
Death I follow
Die tomorrow
Battleaxe
I will kill you
Let me grab my spear
And thrust it through your heart
Fear when I walk near
Fear is with my spear
Your death is near
What is going on in my mind
I've lost all control of my thoughts
Heathen
You gave your faith to liars defiers
Burned my people
We fight them off with honour
Me and my brothers in battle
No one god for me to worship
But myself I'm my own prophet
Of an ancient pagan life
Through other realms my spear will fly
I am a Celtic Shaman
My powers are divine
In a deep trance that will guide your soul to the underworld alone
No one god for me to worship
But myself I'm my own prophet
Of an ancient pagan life
Through other realms my spear will fly
I am a Celtic Shaman
My powers are divine
In a deep trance that will guide your soul to the underworld alone
You gave you faith to liars defiers
Burned my people
A deep trace that will guide your soul to the underworld alone
No one godHold the crown down
My greatest comfort has always been  sedation
Fading to black has always been my  escape for I've long been a sinner and cast my  hatred to the saints
Like weights tied around my legs yearning pulls me to the bottom of the ocean known as despair
I've often questioned the end as much as I have welcomed it
Withering flesh all that's left of a buried conscious
I've exposed my bones to the surfaces and stood idly by as I wait for them to break
Staring into the open sky waiting for answers I don't deserve
I am waiting for answers I haven't earned
I've been left with a vague reflection of the child that I was born
Silence has become his only offer since I turned my back to him fuck
I keep on digging deeper into despair
Of all the risen angels why was I left behind to live like this
Teasing the wolves awaiting bloodshed praying that I can hold my wounds together for long to get out of the woods
Of all the risen angels why was I left behind to live like this
The mirror lies The mirror fucking lies
I'm living in America In America you're on your own America's not a country it's just a business Now fucking pay me
Welcome to the end of our hearts intent
We've been left with a star filled graveyard
We have all signed our name to the grave
We wait for the day we have to watch the skyline burn
Turn your back and feel the blade sinking in as we deem the kind of black hearts
Everyone I know has become a ghost
Lost lonely souls ever more
Everyone I know has become a motherfucking ghost
Lost lonely souls ever more
We have all signed our name to the grave
We wait for the day we have to watch the skyline burn
Turn your back and feel the blade sinking in as we deem the king
Deem me the king
You aren't the only one who thinks that life is just a fucking game everyone plays and no one wins
You aren't the only one with a debt unsettled rode hard and put up wet
Choose your poison and join the sick
Fuck it
You are not alone in this suffering
What do you fucking think it means to have the choice to live your life or lay down and die
You are not the only one who suffers
We are all just as hopeless
Who the fuck do you think you are
I've heard the same sad cries countless times
How could you do this to me God why
It's just part of the game that you hate but you can't change
Don't bleed out before the last scene
Your pride is worthless if you're dead
So die fucking die with your boots strapped tight
Die with a smile but rest assured you'll be forgotten
So sick of this loathsome abyss
All that I want is to feel that I'm alive
My decadence is the reason I'm screaming
All that I want is to say that I fucking tried
Wallow in filth can you get yourself clean from it
Wallow in filth that you buried yourself in
It's such a hollowing confession
That every path you've chose leads down the same road
That everyone you love has lead your heart astray and every hope you've had has landed in a  grave
All I've ever wanted was to somehow find my way out of this darkness and finally reach the light
Wallow in filth wallow in it
Can you get yourself clean from it
Wallow in filth
All the mess you've made for yourself
Can you get yourself clean from it
The saddest songs play and take me back to better days before I was so scarred before I was so lost
I've built a tomb within my mind and locked up all my pride left to die
All of these voices screaming out
who do you think you are fucking with
I know you feel deserted because you are
I know you feel abandoned because you should be
I'm fucking rotten I've been forgotten
I'm not worth the time it takes to change
I'm fucking filthy
I'm not worth saving
My soul is withered
I'm fucking grimy
There's no escaping this hell nothing left to tell myself
Every night gets darker and every morning I wake lifeless
Still breathing still grieving still able to feel the pain
Still breathing still grieving completely desolate
My eyes are artifacts watching the world collapse
So long good riddance
In an open grave I await the end fucking get it over with now
End this now
All that's left in me are fading memories
There is nothing you can say to try and save me
I'd rather never breathe again if it meant I  could forget
Every passing of love all the years in disgust
How could I trust anyone
Scars tie me to the past 
These open wounds will never heal only bleed through eternity
There's no room left in heaven for me
All that's left in me are fading memories
Who needs friends with all these demons
All I wanted was to watch the world burn out with you when both our hearts began to beat in deadly synchronicity
Like a moth drawn to flame you can feel  the heat
you just can not turn away
More lessons learned through defeat than any victory
but the fact remains I'd give anything to erase all of our history
You lit a fire beneath the most precious wings just to ignite the sky and see true peril in the light
I will live to love another name but it doesn't change a fucking thing
My past still carries your disgrace
I'll never sleep again if dreams are made of you
My every dream has turned a nightmare
I'll never sleep again if dreams are made of you
My every dream has turned a fucking nightmare
Should I remind you of just how fickle you are
Should I reveal the truth of all the filthy things you've done
I wouldn't waste my time trying to polish your lies
The truth will surely find its way back to the eyes of everyone that you have fucked
I have no love left for your lying eyes
I have no love left for your wicked tongue
I have no love left for our memories
I have no love left may you rest in piss
I will love you more when you're feeding worms
I will love you more when you are laying in  a fucking casket
I'll never sleep again if dreams are made of you
My every dream has turned a nightmare
I'll never sleep again if dreams are made of you
My dreams are fucking dead
If I am destined for hell may heaven hold your place
I'd rather burn alone than ever have to rot by your side
I need a makeshift lover like a bullet in the head
Thanks to them I've grown despondent
Something about the way something about the way you say that love can't save
sounds like the whisper of a snake
Wait for the right time to strike then spit your venom
I've become a man devoid of trust in anyone who wasn't bound by blood for  water only proves thicker in our tears
I have never known a dream to transcend reality without a reason to retreat
There's something about the way you say I will  never see the day when love becomes my only saving grace
Beneath the moonlight you seem so lovely
Oh how our eyes deceive now don't they
I have never known a dream to transcend reality without a reason to retreat
Something about the way you say nothing can overcome this pain sounds like the devil's poison reckoning
Spit venom
Every wounded lover has the feeling they'll never heal
Every ruined romance leaves the stain of regret 
On to the next foolish victim waiting in line to sign away their life
On to the next foolish victim
Take the lead a foot on the floor  one in  the grave 
Can't you just see we're destine to deserve  this
Follow me a foot on the floor  one in the grave
Can't you see we're dancing with the devil
My scar collection is proof that I've been through hell and lived to tell about it
So let the misery pour down on me like fucking rain
The day I realized where every ecstasy lies was the day my suicide plot slowly dissolved
What's the point in ending an existence before its time
My influence will live on after I die
Save your tears for a day when you can land a river to free them
Save your tears for a better day to drown your fucking sorrows
I've spent countless nights with nothing more than the thought of suicide
There is a battle within that I'm not sure is worth winning
Even if hell is imminent every thought is a  plague
To everyone I love just know
I've always wanted so much more
I used to love the rain until it fell everyday
I used to love the rain until it flooded everything
Save your tears for a day when you can lend a river to free them
Save your tears for a better day to drown your fucking sorrows
Bless this mess
Everything I say revolves around this fucking pain
I can't decide whether it's worth the fucking time to even speak
Everything I say revolves around this pain I can't decide is it worth the time to speak
One day I realized where every ecstasy lies
Weak bitches better back up go ahead get your mouth smacked up
HP bumpin clubs and sucka duckin motherfuckers on the daily
No caution call it arson cause we rollin motherfuckers like blunts
Cunts get dumped in a ditch quick so get your wrists slit still listenin to this shit
Now cock the biscuit and pull it back and put it in between your eyes and think  about that end it Starving marching for miles in the snow
Weakened from enduring the violence
Grave faces with deaths perspective
From the bottomless depths of corruption
Through the back roads and small towns
March one foot in front of other
Dragging along their skeletal bodies
This macabre procession of specters
Only a hand full of survivors
Knowing not where they are going
Tattered in rags hunger in their eyes
Followed by a black cloud of flies
Through the back roads and small towns
March one foot in front of other
Dragging along their skeletal bodies
This macabre procession of specters
Shot and tossed into a grave
Or lead right into the Baltic Sea
Some survive only to die
By the deadly sting of machine gun fire
Through the back roads and small towns
March one foot in front of other
Dragging along their skeletal bodies
This macabre procession of specters
Through the back roads and small towns
March one foot in front of other
Dragging along their skeletal bodies
This macabre procession of specters
Of specters
Twisted faces rising evil
Cold dark places hypnotizing
Slicing slashing bone and flesh
Bleeding screaming sacrifice
Now I can feel I'm losing my mind
The deeper I fall into madness
I hear the master whisper to me
Leading me straight to the blackness
In this silence pure frustration
Filled with violent condemnation
Slicing slashing bone and flesh
Bleeding screaming sacrifice
Now I can feel I'm losing my mind
The deeper I fall into madness
I hear the master whisper to me
Leading me straight to the blackness
Apparitions torture me
Blind sadistic destiny
Slicing slashing bone and flesh
Bleeding screaming sacrifice
Now I can feel I'm losing my mind
The deeper I fall into madness
I hear the master whisper to me
Leading me straight to the blackness
Now I can feel I'm losing my mind
The deeper I fall into madness
I hear the master whisper to me
Leading me straight to the blackness
Protected soul shoveled into a grave
A ghoulish reminder of a challis made of bone
Oceans of time corridors of eternity
Ritual spells address the evil by name
A madhouse of pain the body will burn
The soul moves down
A slave in hell a slave in hell
A lifetime of sin guided by the devil's hand
Prayers for the damned to be redeemed
It's up to the righteous and their hypocrisy
To fight the good fight for you and me
A madhouse of pain the body will burn
The soul moves down
A slave in hell a slave in hell
Touched by evil never to reach the sweet forever
Your torment is profound writing in agony
With the poetry of reality can't keep the faith alive
A madhouse of pain the body will burn
The soul moves down
A slave in hell a slave in hell
A slave in hell a slave in hell
Crusade against science
Angel eyes filled with betrayal
A sacred dance beneath the full moon
Confirms the evil that walks among them
Release the harlot from the stockade
Selfrighteous fools
Blinded by fear and bonded by ignorance
Inflict the accused with their virtuous suffering
A trial by water determines their fate
As the black hearted spectators gather around
There will be fear in their eyes
While they're swimming the witch
Swimming the witch
Swimming the witch tonight
Naked and bound
Humiliated servant of Satan
Shall the water refuse to receive them
In the cold dark waters repeated immersion
Never to see the surface again
There will be fear in their eyes
While they're swimming the witch
Swimming the witch
Swimming the witch tonight
In the pale moonlight
Sinners fear the preacher
But the preachers gotta know
Miracles out of scripture
Are part of the show
Broken and divided
It's always the same
The faithful need a prophet
And the prophet needs someone to blame
Like the spirit of a graveyard ghost
Whose dreams are all shadows and dust
Whose soul still stirs in the breeze
All alone in a dark void of evil
Turn a blind eye when you understand
Angers more useful than despair
Hellfires burning torch is ablaze
All alone in a dark void of evil
Dark void of evil
When the darkness falls over me
Changing perspectives and priorities
It takes away all new possibilities
It's not the way it should be
Stifled and drowning in mediocrity
Scratching and clawing your way to the end
Sometimes it's better to break than to bend
I must have gone too far
I've come unraveled again
It's just all too hard
To look within and not to look away
Some days are not like the rest
Some blur together to make up the years
Soon you stop wondering why
Until you find your life has passed you by
I couldn't help myself I've come unraveled again
It's just all too hard
To look within and not to look away
It always starts out this way
Striving to stay in control
Give in to weakness and hide all the same
The dam has busted loose and I am to blame
I don't posses the strength
I've come unraveled again
I've come all undone
There's not the glue to hold me in place
I must have gone too far
I've come unraveled again
It's just all too hard
To look within and not to look away
Not to look away
Not to look away
Not to look away
Not to look away
Not to look away
Oh not to look away
Voices deep inside my mind
Reminds me of nightmares
I wish I could leave behind
Fire racing through my veins
I'm out of control and burning a hole every day
I hear the voices calling me
They will never ever set me free
Take your chances roll the dice
Live your life like you're gonna live it twice
Just remember this my friend
If you play with fire you'll burn in the end
Desire flowing through my veins
I'm losing control it's burning a hole every day
Changes rolling with the dice
There's got to be a way I can see the light
I hear the voices calling me
They will never ever set me free
Take your chances roll the dice
Live your life like you're gonna live it twice
Just remember this my friend
If you play with fire
You'll burn in the end
Burn
Take your chances roll the dice
Live your life like you're gonna live it twice
Just remember this my friend
If you play with fire you'll burn in the end
Burning in the end burning
Burning in the end burning
Burning in the end burning
Buried deep down in the ground
Long ago forgotten sorrow
Smoldering in the grave nothing but a memory
In the past a promised future stolen by too many lies
A chance for vengeance and redemption
Stirs the rotting corpse to rise
No souls are saved no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave exhumed for the reaping
A new life is born out of the ashes
Alive with a passion passion to kill
Now the sharpened sickle will swing
To harvest the in corrupted remains
No souls are saved no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave exhumed for the reaping
From the unconsecrated hole in the earth
Revived restored resurrected
To dredge up the hopes and dreams of the dead
The whirlwind has come to reap what was sown
No souls are saved no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave exhumed for the reaping
And on the darkest night that which was dead
Returned to the living once again
To walk the earth in madness
No souls are saved no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave exhumed for the reaping
No souls are saved no prayers for the weeping
Arise from the grave exhumed for the reaping
Welcome to the freak show you get a front row seat
To witness the end of civilization
The grim decline and rampant decay
All point the way to our extinction
Now we circle the drain down down we all go
Now we circle the drain all of our struggles in vain
The evil and hatred that grows from religion
Gives the illusion of infinite wisdom
We all pay the penalty of living
While the ownership class does all the taking
Now we circle the drain down down we all go
Now we circle the drain all of our struggles in vain
The circles get smaller and smaller
The circles go faster and faster
The circles get smaller and smaller
The circles go faster and faster faster
In the spiral vortex we still cling to life
Swirling ever downward to what waits below
With a ticket to the freak show
You get a front row seat
To witness the end our fatal climax
The circles get smaller and smaller
The circles go faster and faster
The circles get smaller and smaller
The circles go faster and faster faster
Now we circle the drain down down we all go
Now we circle the drain all of our struggles in vain
Now we circle the drain
All of our struggles in vain
Wrath
It's the wrath of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your game
Always breathing down my neck
Everywhere I stand
But you ain't gonna get me yet
You need a better plan
One step ahead of you
It always ends the same
Cheat the reaper's what I do
I live my life in pain
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your game
One step ahead of you
It always ends the same
Nothing that you can do
When he swings his sacred blade
As he does his dance of death hour glass in hand
He ain't gonna get me yet 'til that final grain of sand
I cheat the reaper fro my life I cheat him for my soul
Always riding to the left 'til he drops his final stone
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your game
One step ahead of you
It always ends the same
Nothing that you can do
When he swings his sacred blade
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your game
Death is hanging over you and everything you do
Black cloak and a grinning skull
He's got a stone for you
Though he wants my head to roll
I cheat him to the end
And when he gets his way
To hell my soul he'll send
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your name
Wrath of the reaper
And he knows your game
One step ahead of you
It always ends the same
Nothing that you can do
When he swings his sacred blade
Wrath
You have expired the coroner is here
The hears has arrived to take you away
Now you're in your bag with your toe tag
Down in the morgue lying on the slab
Soon you'll get your certificate of death
Your final document from life
The last paper to be filled away
Your certificate of death
Your autopsy proves that you're really dead
Embalming fluids now fill your veins
Your lifeless corpse is pale and cold
Your ghostly spirit hovers above
Waiting for your certificate of death
Your final document from life
The last paper to be filled away
Your certificate of death
At rest in your coffin at the funeral home
Family and friends come to say good bye
The grave digger digs a hole just for you
Now you will lay down deep in your grave
With your certificate of death
Your final document from life
The last paper to be filled away
Your certificate of death your certificate of death
Your final document from life
The last paper to be filled away
Your certificate of deatha last look at the field of the dead
the last glance of deceit
sand whipe the white skin
now I feel her choking me and bring me back to life
Sertao  no living man shall see me mourn and weep
a distant god says I'm his will  scorching heat of my land
a place for my mind  such a drought for my soul
life is a dream I stare at the sea dreams of dahomey
I search for the land where snow grows  mother can you hear
barefoot and blistered white king of the dahomey
dahomey the king of dahomey
searching yearning for something more
something else than bones and flies
this is my fault
a kingdom kneeling on its chains
a drought for my soul
your eyes glint as you're threatening my life
but have you ever seen true death
in my morbid boundless thirst
you sill stare at the void into my eyes
no life no dreams no past no name
white demon will reign with rage
it's time for a mute deception
in my land I was a snake
dahomey kneel before the ouster rage of dahomey
if you hide underground
the earth will speak
I command the ants who are no longer dreaming of sand
you'll see
earth snakes and stands in awe for I command
sand whips white skin of demons
I feel her choking me and
sand whips white skin of demons
and bringing back to life white skinned sand demons
I feel her choking me and
sand whips white skin of demons still alive
dead kings will come to depose you
then I will go and sleep
so now
wall up the doors to the women's quarter
as the mourn
in the shadow of the dead giant tree
long after the escape
long after the thirst
a conscience reborn after the cold sleep
I rise in my name
slave slave slave
to guide them through the dark
slave slave slave
a light for the horde
slithering emperor
west is dream of blood stained silk
I wrap myself into
the blankest throne on earth
I embrace the sea and sand
in my bloody hands hands of king
slave  slave slave
to rule them through the dark
slave slave slave
a uniform to drive the horde
slave slave slave
a scepter to trample and pound
them all
their eyes will look at east
and see their peer
as ten thousand miles of fleence
awestruck you'll see
now fear the dark where I won't cast a glance
your eye is evil I bludgeon
your shining skull will feed the dead
summoning the dogs who speak like men
for this is my will
purest gold that smells
my will
rule them by darkness
my will
against time and death
once again in my name
free me
wanton savagery
a life on my knees
survived the mud
once
my mortal life
I shed my ties and found the cruel symmetry
that you call freedom
all hail greed
all hail the snake who tramples on man
all hail greed
all hail the snake
fear no end
fear no spirit
the living are dead
I am deaf to your silence
I am deaf to all of your dreams
I am deaf a thorn deep in my thoughts
I am deaf to pain and screams
 unfold the secrets of the sea
in front of me
I am deaf
a blind heart with no more will
millennial puse beating loud its curse
they sing but why
while they're carried away
iron joke belongs to another
world in here the invisible rules
murderers and kings
the oceans will divide
and unite
fear no end
fear no spirit
the living are dead
here comes the one who'll pay for our sins
here comes the one who'll ascend to the moon
and be purified by the tide of a million dead dreams
an impious herd of souls lies
here below
relentless mind
a waterfall in an open sky mine
soaring high
leaving sorrow cry and despair
in this land
the pure confession of a sollid guilty heart
feeds the fire that enlightens the shadow
the sun that melts our dreams
the seed of horror in my eyes
through these veins
like a fever
to a heart yet so cold
the price of one tear
is what I will pay
to soar the universe
a free flame unclenched
above men's screams
the crimes of kings and brothers
kissing shining cross of sin
men's life finally means nothing
the ultimate revelation
reward in sacrifice
salt in my tears of despair
kill kill kill the chosen one
if I tell the stars not to drop a tear
sky will never see the dawn again
and I came to purify
beast on my right side
father mother brother
if I stretch my arms I reach the moon
coming to life once the coldest dream
a frozen ocean now is the demon I feed
searching for my silk
with my noise I'll make you deaf
the glittering light will make you all blind
skulls have known their defeat
their hands now make my carpet with silk
our wives and our stranglers will give voice to my pride
dance now
it's time for a new war the leopard said
in powder in smoke the sound of drums erases time inside my mind
while I dance and gather greyhounds from the dead
where is my silk
deception is complete as my brother cries and then slowly drowns
the abysses lie to god
steal
steal from me breath from me steal from me glorious king
salute the sovereign the west will hail with fear
abekoute will ask for forgiveness then die
in front of these eyes
the sound of drums erases time inside my mind
while I dance and gather greyhounds from the dead
where is my silk
deception is complete as my brother cries and then slowly drown
the abysses lie and hide my pride
steal from me breath from me
steal from me glorious king
shine shine for my eyes bring my own glory so far
steal from me breath from me
steal from me breath from me stand for your glorious king
forth from here to aanother world of sand
I am a messenger of death
black white
have no taste on rusted scythe's
blade the sickest horror known to mankind
testimony
just like a trail of fire ants feasting on ruins
once the storm has passed
only rooms left for laments and for jackals
no time to die
messenger to a foreign god
sacrifice is done and the ocean will mourn in pain
sacrifice done before manoel can touch the land
die because the living they're not from this world
suffocated with laments of war
I'm the one that carries cries
desolation in me
traitor
white man
your fat is black now allowed I am 
you head will roll
he who dwells in solitude can see it all
only the man who loves nothing
and carries dry sad land inside
trusting no one
will become king second only to solitude eternal and thirst
trust no one
rise to the moon
to unite with snow eternal
the fathers born of ice
and snowflakes that melt with sand
oh for my heart for my heart's dried
I am imprisoned
trust no one
come to me strangler
I feel no pity
For dead foredoomed mankind
No empathy for pain
Feel nothing for them all
For this hole in the sun
Tears me apart yet spits me out
Off the king's road
I step on thorns aside
Where the plagues rise
From the dog's bite
Time doesn't flow
To remit my sin
Time doesn't flow
To occur to my plague
White line has been
Traced into the sand
Surrounded by my army
Blessing the war field with red
If no sound spreads the word
Of the silent raider
You will fear my cry
My eyes upon your reign
Fearing no thorns as i run free
Spreading my plague and my woe
A new kingdom will rise
Out of this world alone
See my spear
I laugh at you
I am alone
I laugh at you
Forgotten by fear
See my spear
I am alone
I'm the alonest of the alone
Now bow
and dig a hole in submission
Now bow
and praise the glorious despair
The goats accept
The body of the savior
Ashes on your head
So the rite is complete
Bow before me
Bow
A trail of white flags
Carries my silent will
A trail of mothers
Carries the strangled spawn
Of my solitude
Melting the snow
Bleeds
I'm alone
blood brother
giant tree
home of the dead
I salute
house of slaves
strangler wife
brother bat
I salute
dahomey heat
burnin wings
stain my soul
I shall no more
consumed
by thirst deprived
lustrum of the dog
he sees me fall
What's the force that leads us all
To live our lives as we're supposed to do
Or makes us waste all our time
Waiting for better times that never come
If we want to feel closer to God
We should raise our eyes to the sky more often
Then we can live a story that is surely true
Because we have lived it all in our minds
I believe this world is still full of good times
You can be sure I want to have them all
It's nice of you to care if I'm ready for the next world
Sorry mister I will take one world at a time
You think you live your life in circles
Oh how do they open and close
When your mind goes beyond the structure of cycles
You will understand our lives move in coils
Why are you so scared of your instinct
A wonderful force that you should always follow
It will make you ready for your next life
When you understand you never have been for this one
Should we fear an eternity of torment
While we can make our hell on earth so damn well
Or should we think that displayed virtues
Won't buy us any better seat in the next life
There are times you feel like
If you don't start to understand
How your mind really works
You'll never be able to survive yourself
That is when you'd better stop
To think that you are somehow doomed
And realize that what happens to you
Should be regarded more like a boon
It is the right time to break up
With the past and superstition
Break up with destructive habits
And negative thoughts
Evolve change evolve
It's time to be king or be killed
Brave are those who stay alive
Our only chance's to be strong and fight
Brave are those who stay alive
There are times you feel so desperate
You could sell your soul to the devil
It seems that one thing's not clear to you son
They can make you give it away as a present
It is the right time to break up
With the past and superstition
Break up with destructive habits
And negative thoughts
Evolve change evolve
It's time to be king or be killed
It's time that I break up
With my past and superstitions
Break up with destructive habits
And negative thoughts
I will evolve change evolve
It's time to be king or be killed
Let there be fire let it burn wild
Let there be fire let it rage out fierce
Liquors strong like molten lead
Burn down the poor believer's throat
Does he know about elevation
Does he know about purification
Being an artist all your life
Being an artist as a full time job
Letting poisons corrupt your body and soul
Allowing their rotten air to desecrate your temple
Only to ascend a higher level of art
Only to achieve the best of what you can do
I am the Earth still I am the Fire
I am the Earth on which the Fire can run wild
Let there be fire
Let's all find out
What is this buzz all about
Let there be fire
Let it mold your soul
Like clay wax or the hand of some god above
Let there be fire
Let's all find out
What is this buzz all about
Let there be fire
Let it mold your soul
Like clay wax or the hand of some god above
Do those people know what happens to you
When you're all alone struggling with Art
Do they know this could be them me or you
So here we are again a new painting in an old frame
So many things have changed yet we are still the same
Still our hunger is the best way to fight all that's fearsome
Still our dreams and passion seem to be stronger than wisdom
Recklessness is the force that makes you say
Thanks for all your efforts world but I'm still alive
Bravery is not how many fights you want to fight
It's all you realize you have survived when you're looking back at your life
You won't lose your honour if you die while trying to feel alive
There are still too many who fall without even knowing why
Recklessness is the force that makes you say
Thanks for all your efforts world but I'm still alive
Live day by day
Think like you were eternal
Running at breakneck speed with the clouds on your side
And a distant gleam of sun ahead
Will you be able to run faster
Than the storm once again
There will always be some sucker warning you
Hic Sunt Leones
Comradeship is not if different heads can somehow fit
It's still looking at each other's face after passing through so much shit
You know you are strong and smart enough to face the change
When those who thought they're leaders only work to get themselves estranged
Live day by day
Think like you were eternal
Running at breakneck speed with the clouds on your side
And a distant gleam of sun ahead
Will you be able to run faster
Than the storm once again
There will always be some fucker trying to scare you
Hic Sunt Leones
Running at breakneck speed with the clouds on your side
And a distant gleam of sun ahead
Will you be able to run faster
Than the storm once again
There will always be some sucker warning you
Hic Sunt Leones
Sick and tired of being sick and tired
Of my own being sick and tired
I don't know what I'm aiming for
All I see here around of me
Is our best dreams crushed down by their feet
And I know this ain't meant to be
I am trying to come to terms with my past
But it will bear its scars forever
Being a borderline is so trendy today
The edge you walk on is oh so steep
What will I find down there
I'm walking on the wrong side of sanity
It's a place I know so well
Where I can play the bipolar shuffle
I have learnt throughout my life
Our mind's so strong it can trick itself
And I wonder if that's good at all
My skin tells of who I am
This doesn't mean the story must be nice
Pretty child come watch my downfall
The edge you walk on is oh so steep
What will I find down there
Cure me clean me I will get sick again
Soothe me heal me then give me a gun
I'll shoot again
The edge you walk on is oh so steep
What will I find down there
I'm walking on the wrong side of sanity
It's a place I know so well
Where I can play the bipolar shuffle
I'm verging on the funny side of lobotomy
Stepping on the morbid side of lucidity
So I can play the bipolar shuffle
You know you might have pushed yourself too far
When you realize that even saying
A simple sentence as I am unhappy
Has become so hard for you
You know things have reached the point of no return
When you can't understand anymore
If the quiet silent vastness of the Ocean is still a friend
Or if it has become an enemy
You give me love
And you take my freedom away
You call it love when it makes you feel fine
You call it love when it makes you feel like dying
Take my fears take my demons and my tears
Take my shouts in the night
Take my never sent love letters
Turn them into feathers
So I can use them to fly
I have no more desires left
But to be the melody you hear through the noise
Like feathers to a bird my voice will fly to you
And help us fill the void
Take my fears take my demons and my tears
Take my shouts in the night
Take my never sent love letters
Turn them into feathers
So I can use them to fly
You give me love
And you take my mind away
But you never call it love my friend
If it doesn't make you cry and bleed
Sometimes just sometimes
Father father why are they attacking us
There needn't he a reason why
We'll fight hack without a cause
Father father who is attacking us
There needn't be a name or face
Wanna do well Give 'em hell
Man is wolf to men
Who are wolves to other men
Who are less wolves then they are
Hatred is disease retaliation is the cure
War is meaningless
If we have no enemies to fight
If the enemy and war are inside our heads
What is the reason why we display our warmight
It's a me against you
Against him who is against
Who knows who world
War can be a blitz
Ignorance is bliss
But arrogance will never stop being so chic
Father father will they keep on coming back
If you want a safe peace
Keep on fighting 'till they're wrecked
Father father is this all right or wrong
If your flag waves in the end
Your name will be sung in a song
War is meaningless
If we have no enemies to fight
If the front and defence lines are inside our heads
What is the reason why we display our warmight
War is a business in itself
It's the same old setting only the actors change
If I offer you a Jack and Cock will you blow my soul away
Just forget what the preachers say
You can get close to Heaven
Only with a man who's got a Hell inside himself
It starts as a tickle in your head
It crawls down your spine just like a thrill
Then it burns out like a fire
Right between your thighs
Shake it or leave it this is my Ass O Ass
The truth lies in the sweat
So kill me with your bitter sweet death tonight
Shake it or leave it this is my Ass O Ass
The truth lies in the sweat
So kill me now I've chosen my poison
You make me feel like some kind of saint
In a triple Xrated haze of Father Son and Holy Ghost
Yet if the body is a temple then yours was clearly made
For violation so give me head 'til the end of time
You've got all your life baby
But I've only got tonight
I can never get enough
Of that diving in your muff
Shake it or leave it baby yeah
I've chosen my poison
No matter how old or wise we can be
No matter if they call us sir your honour or PhD
There are monsters that still live under our bed
They bite and snarl and drool and scratch
With fangs that rip and shred
No more Lay me down to sleep
'Cause no one else could my soul keep
But if you'd die before I wake
To hell with you my soul you can take
The years that pass by will not make us grow old
Wisdom comes along with the scars on our bodies
With the wrinkles on our faces the wounds in our souls
And the empty lonely desperate looks in our eyes
There can never ever come the day
The price we've got to pay seems fair
They once were immortal now they're old and frail
The tears of a forlorn child still there
No matter how rich or successful we could get
No matter if people look at us in fear awe or regret
Deep inside us there still lives a child
That won't stop crawling on all fours
Looking for a place to hide
Growing up turns into growing old
All of our dreams only turned to hopes
No place for compassion
Only sadness and decay
If you think that your God has forsaken this world
Come with me I can show you where he has gone
While we were so busy looking for the meaning
Of existence that we forgot what it means to merely exist
I have lived so many lives
Does it mean I must be ready to die
Come Full Circle when the Age of the Lions returns
One thing that nobody will ever tell us
Is that going through reincarnation can hurt so much
But if the sky fell on my head today
I know I cannot die 'cause I'm an idea so I'd not be afraid
No one really changes that's the curse of us all
But while we evolve what we are isn't really getting lost
I have lived so many lives
Does it mean I must be ready to die
Come Full Circle when the Age of the Lions returns
After living so many lives
Can we finally be ready to die
Close the Circle let the Age of the Lions return
Let it returnMastless is the drakkar of Himinbjorg
for his sails sails are our arms
for his oars are our hearts
We sail on the waves of life
we roam through the maze of our destinies
In the memory of our bloodbrothers
we carry on dreaming
and we are still fighting
Blessed are the Pagan dreamers
cause they pray to the old gods of our memories
The land is so green and the trees so strong
as our beliefs should be
as the depths of the sea
Nature hides the keys of life
And we the colours that make her so sweet
Some tears flow out along the face of a child
Explosion black out some terrifying cries
A hat covers the body of a child
Angry hate everything becomes blind
You the godsend the hero of the nation
You say that you kill to save your country
You obey some shadows
that someone makes dance in front of your eyes
You're only a slave
Some tears flow out along the face of a child
Explosion black out some terrifying cries
A hat covers the body of a child
Angry hate everything becomes blind
These are the tears of the nation
And not those of the masters of this world
These are the children of the nation
and not those of the tyrants of this world
The nation is just a child to whom we lie
But don't forget that it's blood which flows
Free yourself from these traps
so that some rays of light spring from your steps
I am a shore haunted by the waves of the devil
to be drawn in a dream
and saved by a nightmare
They come and go just take and give
to be drawn in a dream
and saved by a nightmare
I'm no longer without them
As these waves are no longer without me
to be drawn in a dream
and saved by a nightmare
And the stars shine on the ocean
calling me to rise and join the right
to accomplish my life
But the stars that I see
and covet are in the water
They're just a reflection
and as I could melt with my dream
they go back and this is neverending
Dakaltra mistress of one's dark desires
I acknowledged and knelt at your feet
My funeral bride your silver icy eyes
remind me of Lilith
I gazed into your icy eyes ya Dakaltra
I rode over the storms
and defied time for you
My only maze was the mists of your heart
your dark altar yeah
Dakaltra your spell so strong
and organic as my heart
forever cold and burnt
We shared our blood and souls
My only maze was the mists of your heart
since these neverending nights
when your gaze ablazed my heart
My life opens out
into a deep and glowing silence
I break through the wraths of light
one after the other forever faster
Now the silence wraps me in its material heat
thicker and thicker warmer and warmer
as I melt into the eternal
Everything accelerates
Everything becomes lighter
Everything finishes
I am no more
Everything brings me back to who I am
I have everything to do
I feel I see I touch
I hate myself
My inner being stands up in front of me
It stares at me It's me I stare at it
I look myself staring at myself
Since the road is so long since the rain is so cold
I prowl among all the people since I am so lonely
Since the snow is so nice when it's when it's falling slowly
I prowl among all the people but I am so lonely
I'm so hateful that the fire rises within me
I know that it's gonna bring me power
Alone I walk in the night
All around me is so dark
Too many things I don't understand
All this hate I hold in my hands
In the eyes of the night I saw evil
In the eyes of the night I saw
In my head burn the flames of destructions
In my veins flows the blood of malediction
Voices of revenge calling me
Could they some day be set free
In the eyes of the night I saw evil
In the eyes of the night I saw
Voices of revenge calling me
Could they some day be set freeBallads of death
In killing fields
A new age of fear
A life of kings
Forgotten ones
Concealed in shadows
The piercing wails
Of human flesh
Wraiths suspended time and fate
Fate comes knocking at the door
Wraiths foretell the tyrant's tale
Wraiths will sing their glorious songs
Carved for eternity
A name in gold
Seek immortality
In every breath
Yet justice prevails
And in the throes of death
Vengeance is vile
Open the gates of hell
Wraiths standing the test of time
Time will only wait so long
Wraiths foretell the tyrant's fate
Wraiths returned to hallowed ground
Columns of rising smoke
Written in wreaths of lies
In unmarked tombs of pain
Silence screams
Unspoken words of valour
Grow louder through the years
Though falling on deaf ears
Are carried by the winds
Relics of sin
Steal the night away
Lurking in sleep
Phantom daffodils
Castles of sand in changing tides
Fall to the scorn of accusing waves
One by one refusing pleas
Digress triumphantly into the seas
As tyrants slowly drown in sacrificial waters
Awaiting wraiths of fabled lore find their peace
Fall back into the mists of fading endless battles
Remembrance following their stoic solid stride
Wraiths standing the test of time
Wraiths recall the tyrant's fate
Wraiths returned to hallowed ground
Wraiths sing their glory
Ballads of death
In killing fields
A new age of fear
Phantom crows brave the skies
Fallen squires branding the cross
In the wake of rebellion Lucifer's morning star
By the light of the ages the damage is done
Burying the laughter the bright light of darkness is undone
In the blink of an era blinding the sun
Innocence doused in sin
Fallen squires branding the cross
In the arms of affection ravishing virginal pyres
Repenting to mutes sharpen fiery tongues
Reeking of roses the foul air of piety abound
In a moment of strength sanctity downed
Drinking the wine
Tasting the flesh
Solemn demons
Fallen angels
Crowned desire and chaos preaching peace
Crowned desire and chaos repenting honor
Crowned desire and chaos relentless savior
Crowned desire and chaos drowning in blood
Seeking paths to eternal bliss
Amongst thieves of eternal youth
Gasping fiends steal the dying breath
The morbid gaze of still life speaks no lies
Phantom crows brave the skies
Fallen squires branding the cross
Innocence doused in sin
Fallen squires
Phantom crows brave the skies
Fallen squires branding the cross
In the wake of rebellion Lucifer's morning star
Desecrated
Sealed death
Walking corpses
Reapers of Gomorrah
Calling from the East
Savoring sweet sermons
Satan's feast
Fragrant foul alluring
Lurking venom spills
Minions maiming courage
One by one
Desecrated
Putrid lips
Deathly dirges
Reapers of Gomorrah
Marching in the East
Decotion drenched in blood
Deed by deed
Fragrant foul alluring
Weeping blinded eye
Hordes awake in nightmares
Dream by dream
Saviors
Soldiers of misfortune
Drown remorse
With scented lies
Wretched are the humble
Blessed are the bold
Craven putrid pledges
Fade
Wretched are the mourners
Blessed those who kill
Incestuous putrid pledges
Cry
Wretched are the peaceful
Blessed cowards flee
Spineless putrid pledges
Run
Inheriting the dying
Hallowed be thy nameless
Lethal putrid pledges
Fade Fade
As carrion men moan for burial
And foul deeds reign free upon the earth
No sentry keeps the flame afire while squalls of rage devour their name
Desecrated

For thine is

No No
Tempestuous souls
In everlasting prayers
Rest in peace
Rest in peace
Fractured tombs
And catacombs of woe
Flowers bloom
Flowers bloom
For thine is
Life is
For thine is demise
No No
The hollow men
With eyes that disappear
Selling dreams
Selling dreams
Fading stars
Extinguishing the light
Empty tombs
Empty tombs
In this valley of the fallen
The valiant wind carries the souls
Of broken stones
And silents foes
Of hollow men
In Death's other Kingdom
Walking alone
Solemn night hearts of gloom
Grieve lasting love
While tales are told to deceive
And songs are sung in distant dying paths
To fill the emptiness the emptiness
For thine is
Life is
For thine is demise
No No
For thine is
Life is
For thine is demise
No No
Tempestuous souls
In everlasting prayers
Rest in peace

For thine is

No No
Imprisoned in the mind's wall
of a sadness far away
Empty thoughts of darkness
fill the everlasting day
Exploding from the realm
into the structured life
The undulating feelings
of transformation of strife
This is my Disorder Of The Order
There has been an act of war
declared to the world by terrorists
I can't sit at home and watch TV
anger and sadness rules my heart
what kind of justice must be done
all the death and pain
now it has to begin with us
the fuckin' bastards have to die
we are at war we are at war
no regard for human life
united we have to ge
but how far
but how far
torture death and pain
no regard no respect
will be ingredients
for human life
we respect
I have to die
we are at war we are at war
we are at war we are at war
no one is safe
nothing for sure
crimes against humanity
for a king in hell
Satan's work is done
and we will be none
another holocaust
himan death a bloody cost
a pleasure they need
and we will agree
the world starts to burn
but no one will learn
is it what I will get
do we all like to forget
do you wanna be safe
something to say
do so
and conquer their way
and delete their way
and delete their way
and delete their way
we are at war
now we have
to ask again
eyes are blinded from the one
fight for what we have to believe
all around burned to ash
bodies bodies
teacher's lessons
for your life
getting our way
bodies bodies
burned to ash
getting our way
take our life
we are at war we are at war
there has been an act of war
declared to the world by terrorists
I can't sit at home and watch TV
anger and sadness rules my heart
what kind of justice must be done
all the death and pain
now it has to begun with us
the fuckin' bastards have to die
we are at war we are at war
we are at war we are at war
we are at war
Crushing into the cranium
of a brain gone far beyond
Are images of chaos
long before we walked on down
Defile the senses
while feelings travel through the space
Recoil the reflexes
to the subjugated of a race
You will gather there tonight  
you can hear the bullets of my cry
We will turn our amps to ten  
the battle will start at over again
Disorder of the order  Into the present now
Disorder of the order  A madness will last
The gates of hell are open now  
we won't be your fuckin' clown
reign of terror will begin  
we promise it's not the world's end
As the order of life slowly fades away
The ship docks at the bay 
slowly fades away
Disorder of the order
slowly fades away
Will arise from the past
slowly fades away
Disorder of the order
Into the present now
Disorder of the order
A madness will last
Diluting the insanity of the world's scare
Diffusing the reaction
Deviating from obscure normality
The master pleads temporary insanity
Disorder of the order
Into the present now
Disorder of the order
A madness will last
Disorder of the order
Into the present now
Disorder of the order
A madness will last
Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say
Break the Evil Break the Evil
In the sweat of my bed
I woke up in the darkening sun
To see the moon to see the dark
And I leave my home with a smile
When the sun turns into the night
I look up to the sky and see the sign
As I walked along my street
I checked out the echo of my feet
A voice like a shadow of reflections
I'm wondering about my reactions
I just needed someone to talk to
And that can only be you
Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say
Time to run for the fight
Because they run for their right
Its evil has yet to be told before our souls get cold
Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say
Break The Evil Break The Evil
Break The Evil Break The Evil
Break The Evil Break The Evil
Sounds like a whisper your words
But they will never disappear
I try to flee from everything
Soon I see the bizarre travesty
Respect everything that you leave
Fuck everything you can't believe
Put down what they pray
For our erth in decay
They prepare us to die
So we scream our cry
Your words sound like a whisper
But they will never disappear
I try to flee from everything
Soon I see the bizarre travesty
Respect everything that you leave
Fuck everything
Not to be a prisoner of their way
We have to slide to the core
Time to run for the fight
Because they run for their right
Its evil has yet to be told before our souls get cold
Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say
Break The Evil Break The Evil
Today is just another day
In which I can hear me say
Break The evil Break The Evil
In the sweat of my bed
I woke up in the darkening sun
To see the moon to see the dark
And I leave my home with a smile
When the sun turns into the night
I look up to the sky and see the sign
Inside of me  I love to be
I'm ready now  So show me how
Don't marry me  Be wild and free
You're thrilling me  It's for you and me
I like to tell  Pass not away
Behind the wall  You wonder why
You feel it too  So let us do
It's hard for me  I learn to see
It's fuckin' pain  Not more about
I see the sea  You're calling me
Don't let it die  inside of you
Give it to me  It's my decay
I like to leave the world outside
Because all the words I wrote
will not fit to my voice
I'm telling it to you
But it's the last thing I can do
When I see you passing away
This holy fire is going
Deeper deeper in my soul
I never thought before
Deeper deeper deeper in my soul
I never thought before
How can I make to change my mind
Because I wanna make it right this time
it doesn't matter much for you
I am lost in confusion
I have to grasp new illusions
and I'm tired of losing
words like that never crossed my way
but you know  feelings can learn to die
I like to leave the world outside
Because all the words I wrote
will not fit to my voice
I'm telling it to you
But it's the last thing I can do
When I see you passing away
This holy fire is going
Deeper deeper in my soul
I never thought before
Deeper deeper deeper in my soul
Alone in a sea of agony
That will be a lonely way to be
I don't like to make it hard for me
Time will tell our way to stay
I am lost in confusion
I have to grasp new illusions
I'm tired of losing
Believe in my wordsit's hell a on earth
It's been a while since I felt so high
But I feel you'll say goodbye
I will miss you if you just go away
Unbound by the feeling we just had today
It seems it's hard to talk for you
But it's something I would like to do
It will never be the same
Because I am lost in your name
Today I will pay that bill
And I will not think about your thrill
When I woke to find you gone
I have stopped to drag you all along
We are drawn to my desire
Is that the demon you are running for
I wouldn't have to be in love for you
If I locked that door before
I will leave your world tonight
And for you it will be all right
Even though I am in love with you
All that to say  what's it to you
My heart therefore feels like it's tattoed
With all the thoughts which came from you
You feel okay and I'm still alone
I have to take care of that dangerzone
It's a hell on earth
You cried so long like a huge lost child
You're digging for the answer worldwide
You wonder while they understood you wrong
Why you can't get it on
You told me the secrets of your life
But now you guard them like a lie
I have to cut your pictures from the wall
Before your smile lets me rise and fall
I would like and liked to be at your side
In all your secrecy
Aling your destiny
Within your dreams
And fight for your screams
In dignity
Far away from agony
Far away from agony
When you feel free
But you forced my soul with needles
You turned your lightning down on low
And my love to you has to go like the snow
It's been a while since I felt so high
But I feel you'll say goodbye
I will miss you if you just go away
Unbound by the feeling we just had today
It seems it's hard to talk for you
But it's something I would like to do
It will never be the same
It's something I would like to say
It's a hell on earth
When wild storms dwell
When loosened elements are tightened by a dream
When I must feel this way
When life has to be changed
Nothing's right since you left me
My life was full but now it's empty
Now I never know where I stand with you
It was so strange how it was fading out
And now I've got something more to say
Before we go away before I go away
I dont' wanna be alone is that why I'm coming home
But I lie and it's killing my soul
My heart is broken into pieces of it all
Everywhere I try to go I find myself nothing to know
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I feel it's eating me
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I feel it has to be
I prayed to God  I prayed to Satan
I prayed to God  I prayed to God
I prayed to God  I prayed to Satan
I prayed to God  I prayed to God
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I feel it's eating me
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I feel it has to be
I will never know but I feel you had to go
You broke my heart when I stood with you
So now my chance has passed me by
I will never know if you really changed your mind
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I feel it's eating me
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I feel it has to be
I prayed to God  I prayed to Satan
I prayed to God  I prayed to God
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I bleed I bleed I bleed
I feel it's killing me
Although we have never been so close
we feel we are connected to each other
in dreams desires and goals
Our realms will soon collide
The bond permeates our souls
Closer than a husband or wife
Beyond external strife
Lies our final destiny
In a world forlorn in suffering
There will soon be a gathering
An epic meeting of the minds
It's a Blood Bond  Blood Bond
Through pain and misery
Blood Bond  Blood Bond
Look to the east  Gaze to the west
Blood Bond  Blood Bond
What do we see
Blood Bond
It's a blood bond
Through pain and misery
Keep an eye on the inside
Flowing burning on outside
Seething energy so we realize
Flowing burning on outside
Flexing the desire of doubt
Flowing burning on outside
Keep an eye on the inside
when we need to meet outside
It's a blood bond  Blood Bond
Through pain and misery
Blood Bond  Blood Bond
Look to the east  Gaze to the west
Blood Bond  Blood Bond
What do we see
Blood Bond
It's a blood bond
Through pain and misery
Although we have never been so close
we feel we are connected to each other
in dreams desires and goals
Manifesting a world inside
Our realms will soon collide
The bond permeates our souls
Closer than a husband or wife
Beyond external strife
Lies our final destiny
In a world forlorn in suffering
There will soon be a gatherin
An epic meeting of the minds
I don't wanna live without your fantasy
And I like to come in your way to play
I am not that kind
Do you like to change your mind
My love is not dangerous
I've got so much to say
A thousand lies  around us
A thousand lies  around us
Don't lock the door with your old key before
You locked into my inner eyes
My desire is burning inside of me
You taught me your right from wrong
Try to run
I can see
Please be strong
The one who warned me all about
I can tell that I wouldn't be without
I searched the whole world for someone like you
but I feel that you wonder what love is all about
No more sadness
No more bursting out
Two hearts can fit like a fuckin' glove
A Thousand Lies  around us
A Thousand Lies  around us
You taught me your right from wrong
Try to run
I can see
Please be strong
The one who warned me all about
I can tell that I wouldn't be without
Now shut your mouth
A Thousand Lies  around us
A Thousand Lies  around us
A Thousand Lies  around us
A Thousand Lies  around us
A Thousand Lies  around us
an island told me
A Thousand Lies  around us
an island told me
A Thousand Lies  around us
Life went too fast
A Thousand Lies  around us
Princess of Hell  Give it to me
Princess of Hell  It's my decay
Princess of Hell  For your body to smell
These lyrics are simple to understand
There's nothing more for me to say
Into the pleasure of pure feeling
We all think the same you look like me
I was the first  I am not the last
So face the dead  let's start it fast
Survive the mighty flash of thrash
Amps are roaring  power chords clash
Our razor blade edge  hammer the wizard
Doublebass pounds  for the metal blizzard
Wring your axe  to bomb the hall
Blood on my strings  until I fall
Princess of hell  Give it to me
Princess of hell  It's my decay
Princess of hell  For your body to smell
It's your escape from the earth
I open my gates of hell
There's nothing more to tell
From below and not above
I give it to you  my love
I throw it up to spit it out
I throw it up to spit out
There's nothing more to tell
I give it to you  my love
I break your neck for my thoughts
There's nothing more to tell
From below and not above
I open my gates of hell
The thunder roars from the crowd
I follow my advice
Without any kind of lies
I die to stay that way
Much more than I can say
I was young when it infected me
Amps are roaring  power chords clash
Our razor blade edge  hammer the wizard
Doublebass pounds  for the metal blizzard
Wring your axe  to bomb the hall
Blood on my my string  until I fall
Princess of Hell  Give it to me
Princess of Hell  It's my decay
Princess of Hell  For your body to smell
My life is fully insane
I will not leave it all behind
I bleed in my inner fuckin' wound
Sie folgen mir Sie folgen mir
Sie jagen und sie schlagen mich
Ich leide and Verfolgungswahn
Keiner mich verstehen kann
Ich renne weg Ich haue ab
Ich hab mich langsam selber satt
Sie folgen mir Sie folgen mir
Sie jagen und sie schlagen mich
Morgens ist der Traum vorbei
Aufgewacht und nicht mehr high
Hab ich Angst und hör sie kommen
Von meinem Traum noch ganz benommen
Dieses Dröhnen lärmen stampfen
Spürs in meinem Hirni tanzen
Morgens ist der Traum vorbei
Aufgewacht und nicht mehr high
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn
Jeder muss mal glauben dran
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn 
Du bist ihr Fang ihr roter Strang
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn
Das ist gottlob vielleicht dein Tod
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn
Jeder muss mal glauben dran
Sie quälen mich Sie quälen mich
Sie reissen mir die Arme aus oh welch ein Graus
Ich leide an Verfolgungswahn
Ich glaube lansam selber dran
Und renn nicht weg 's hat keinen Zweck
Wird mich besaufen und dann laufen
Abends geh ich dann zur Ruh
Mach meine Auglein zu
Träume süss von meinem Feinden
Hör sie durch das Fenster steigen
Morgens ist der Traum vorbei
Aufgewacht und nicht mehr high
Hab ich Angst und hör sie kommen
Von meinem Trauum noch ganz benommen
Dieses Dröhnen lärmen stampfen
Spürs in meinem Hirni tanzen
Morgens ist der Traum vorbei
Aufgewacht und nicht mehr high
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn
Jeder muss mal glauben dran
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn 
Du bist ihr Fang ihr roter Strang
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn
Jeder muss mal glauben dran
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn 
Du bist ihr Fang ihr roter Strang
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn
Das ist gottlob vielleicht dein Tod
Verfolgungswahn Verfolgungswahn
Jeder muss mal glauben dran
You go to the church  you kiss the cross
You worship Satan  Baphomet is your boss
You gave your soul to Christianity
Watch your mouth  stop your blasphemy
It's the same old game
Only time will tell
Who will be the winner
Heaven versus Hell
Born to be crucified
Your evil demon will never see the light
You Christian coward listen to you pray
You are blinded by Satan  you chose the wrong way
It's the same old game
Only time will tell
Who will be the winner
Heaven versus Hell
Waking up in horror fright
I know I'll never win this fight
I feel empowered by Satan at my side
You weak believer will never see the light
It's the same old game
Only time will tell
Who will be the winner
Heaven versus HellA cloud of darkness moving in
Shadows all remove my skin
Drain my corpse cut away the flesh
I'm a mere hollow shell burnt down to ash
I always wanted to move mountains
Instead I closed the curtains
I guess it must've been the burden
That kept me down under
All life in a slumber
It makes me wonder
Am I the hunter
Or am I being hunted
Is this the last
I will see from hell
Farewell they've rang my bell
It's time to leave this rotten world
Nothing left to feel the hurt
Forever is a lie
We live alone and that's how we die
No second chance there's no blue pill
There ain't anymore blood to spill
Dead end
I'm going nowhere
I'm stuck in my own despair
The hole I dug myself in
Good or bad the line is thin
Will I find my true self or just give in
Is this the last
I will see from hell
Farewell they've rang my bell
It's time to leave this rotten world
Nothing left to feel the hurt
Stranded deep
I've sunk my ship
A last minute one way trip
I was right life is infernal
Only death is eternal
Hell is home
And home is hell
But we're still doing well
Hiding in our empty shell
Underneath of what our eyes can perceive
Lies nothing more than what we already see
A world in flames glowing ever so brightly
Can you feel it burn to cinder
I've stumbled upon scorched earth
My demons may have found me
Resurrect the earth
Let it rise from the ashes
Resurrect
Hell is home
And home is hell
But we're still doing well
Hiding in our empty shell
We are the scavengers of earth
Relentless we take everything
Nothing is safe from our evil hands
Reckless we take everything
We disroot all of nature's treasures
From the garden we once thrived up from
To the grave in which we'll find our end
Your blatant lies won't stand
When all hell comes crashing down again
Hell is home
Home is hell
Resurrect
Let it rise
Light the fire and start anew
Passing through the valley of defilement
The blade in my hand is my only companion
Covered in mud it's slowing my pace
Wandering deeper inside the swamp
Overtaken by poison vermin and plague
As I search for a glimpse of the sky
The truth remains covered by a lie
Free me from my alter ego
Hold my hand and feel the burn
Close the gate behind me shut
Nothing left for me to chase
Hear the demon inside my soul
My decaying body's pride
Cruelty won't leave my side
Ease the pain and make me whole
Even in this reign of misery there's still light to guide the way
Dear
Astraea cleanse my soul
Lift the grip of darkness on my hollow bones
Ease the pain and make me whole
Take a look at those forgotten ruins
Inside the frigidness of your unwholesome soul
And make one last attempt to save your brittle mind
As you grasp for the foreboding truth that lies within
Your time is now
I wake up every day with regret in my heart
All these times that
I chose wrong
I don't know where
I belong
I barely got some free space
To keep my mind in place
Fear whispers me there's no way to win this race
Life shines every day but you're living in constant darkness
You keep running around but you fail to cherish the moment
Desperate fearful insecure your social angst keeps you on edge
If you can't stop this fight you'll slowly perish inside
Your time is fading out
You perish inside
You perish inside
You won't win this fight
Breathe life let shine
Breathe life let shine
Your time is now
I'm not in control
This life is passing me by
I'm not in control
I closed one door and
I lost sight
I'm not in control
This life is passing me by
I'm not in control
My world is crumbling from the inside
We all know the first step you ever take
Slowly starts your journey into the unknown
Every day changing in constant motion
Makes it hard to find shelter
Yet after a while insecurity begins to darken the sky
I always believed to be so flawless
So much that
I lost sight
Alas making my actions feel so uncontrolled
I'm not in control
This life is passing me by
I'm not in control
I closed one door and
I lost sight
I'm not in control
This life is passing me by
I'm not in control
My world is crumbling from the inside
After all this time the only thing
I know for sure
Is that no matter what choice
I make
There's still one promise that
I can't break
I can see the light shining from the top of the mountain down on me
Down on me
Down on me
I remember the days when we grew up in our hometown
I was always there to help you up when you fell down
We would laugh and drink into the night
And meet disaster the next day
Now that
I need you the most
You're gone up in smoke nowhere to be found
I've put my trust in you and you've let me down
You've let me drown
We used to say we'll go down swinging
I got your back brother
Fighting side by side
'Til the end of days
With a smile on our face
We used to say we'll go down swinging
I got your back brother
Fighting side by side
'Til the end of days
But your face has changed
You're gone astray
I can still see your face
I can still hear you say
In the back of my mind
In the back of my mind
You're gone astray
I've put my trust in you and you've let me down
You've let me drownMerlin the Mystic he guards ten thousands graves
Bribe him with a flask but don't give up your name
Sitting at the gates in the middle of the night
Witching hour corpse arise when the time is right
Scheming 'neath the moon
Casting wicked spells
Punish hearts so dark
Drag them into hell
Breathed its rancid stench
Reject humanity
Summon dead's return
Each day waits for
Zombies seeking out the flesh of humans
Zombies ripping up the flesh
Abandoned the world a cemetery home
Solitude so pure yet cold and so alone
Merlin weeps
Bastardized by the flesh
Captive souls cannot transcend
The supremacy of instinct
Wallow in putridity
The infinite stretch of the mind
An essence encased in dust
Cannot sever but we must
This flesh is ridiculous
Carnality eviscerates
Plagues the soul with waste
This flesh is ridiculous
In 1666 cobwebs lace the cluttered graveyard
Decaying tombs of scattered dead
Plaguing landscapes within the gates
Filled with corpses once reanimated
Back to life brought back to life
Reanimated
And Merlin sayeth
Get the fuck up you crazy corpse
Dripping from a solar flare
Molten time lubricates existence
Clouds of neurons
Dendrites impregnate the earth
Flesh is spawned
Decrepit art of mutilation
A cyclic universe
Empties its bowels
Beyond endless seas of time
Lost in translation of being
The continuum weaves
With tentacles so pure
A wretched rebirth
Cloaked in pain
Limbs contorted with grotesque symmetry
Spiraling to their final form
Amidst eternity fertility manifest
Putrid rebirth
Tonight it will rain blood
Like snow falling from mountain tops
Tonight it will rain death
Fire rising up from hell
Nothing left
This is the end of time
Disintegrate into obscurity
Universe decease
Blinded Eyes corrupted by the power of mankind
With empty hearts they run with the devil hand by hand
No one is ashamed but devastated forests they have left
Hear wath i'm saying
You don't have the right to take my land
Sky is warning the raising storm
Rain is falling my words with blood
Adid rain all arround this madness is so real
Smoke and fire the world will go to take it's revenge
Sky is warning thje raising storm
Rain is falling my words with blood
Nothing to say damage is done it's too late
I wonder why mankind only think of themselves
Sky is warning the raising storm
Rain is falling my words with blood
Walking down the streets some visions come to me
And darkness fills the world
Fire down below is burning up my soul
I spread my wings
I'm not afraid to fight the evil one
Again I'll try to give my best
The fallen angels now knock at my door
I feel it near
Is this a dream
Inside Hell
Demons are fighting blasting all the ways
Inside hell
An endless nightmare never lets you go Oh no
Battle was so strong extermination blows
Skies are turning red
I'm waiting for the dawn to sacrifice their souls
Arising my blade
I'm not afraid to fight the evil one
Again I'll try to give my best
The fallen angels now knock at my door
I feel it near
Is this a dream
Inside hell
Demons are fighting blasting all the ways
Inside hell
An endless nightmare never let you go Oh no
The light has gone forever
Flashing memories in my head
Destruction is all arround me
Darkness and fear looking at my eyes
I see the light of dawn
Power awakes to return 
Nothing else to fear Please believe me
When the sun begins to shine so bright
New horizons will rise from the dark
and the voices of the world will be united
As you will see Human Factor is the way

After all blowing disaster
An age of conscience must regin
Now take your own knowledge
Look at yourself and realize
I see the light of the dawn 
Power awakes to return
Nothing else to fear Please believe me
When the sun begins to shine so bright
New horizons will arise from the dark
And the voices of the world will be united
As you will see Human Factor is the way

Here from the mountain I see the world
Laying themselves about a fantasy world
Crying from freedom because they know They were wrong

All my pain I'll never fall again
Fight is my name and killing is my game
I'll never give up never surrender
All your tears apart
Now hear what I say
It's time to break the chains
Now I can feel it's to break free

The end isn't far away
And sun will shine again
Why I'm living in darkness

Deep into your heart
After the night a beam of sun
Will show the path out of the dark
And you must trust your faith

Deep into your heart
I I've crossed through the mountains
And I must return to the past
Follow all my emotions
To see the light again
Ride then against the wind
There's fire in your soul
Deep inside your madness never find control
Don't don't ask me why
My journey has just began
And don't don't try to stop me
I spread my wings and I'll fly to the skies
Flying across the seven seas
I'm tracing my life to the past
Memories of sorrow I'm leaving behind
New horizons are back
A brave new world is waiting for me
No one can take me apart
I'm free to choose I'm living my life
'Cos now I'm saying Good Bye
Ride fast against the wind
There's fire in your souls
Deep inside your madness never find control
Don't don't ask me why
My journey has just began
And don't don't try to stop me
I spread my wings and I'll fly to the skies
No return never again
Don't follow me
Here I am trying to return to my own world
The last age of hate now is waiting to regin
Why is mankind condemned
Why does the ocean carry death
Fly to the past I'm back in time to help
People from the pain
Fill with the light their minds and souls
To save the future of mankind
Rage inside the ancient spirit will guide
For you to cry a change is so needed to live
Why is mankind condemned
Why does the ocean carry death
Fly to the past I'm back in time to help
People from the pain
Fill with the light their minds and souls
To save the future of mankind
Time will be forever
You're a slave of time
Sometimes you feel that you are drowning in a glass
That you are lonely and you're forced to be alive
Look arround
Try to find the way
You're the one
That's going down 
Can you see
The light is near
If you want you'll survive
See the light
The light in front of your eyes
Be the one
The one against the pain
Sometimes you need to feel 
That you're against the wall
To prove yourself
That you're strong enough
Can you see
The light is near
If you want to you'll survive oh yeah
See the light
The light in front of your eyes
Be the one
The one against the pain
I feel stronger than before
It's time to realize my thoughts
Realize
Sometimes you need to prove yourself
That you are strong enough to fight against oh yeah
If you want to race my engine starts to roar
'Cos now it's time to show you
That if you don't want to die
Just try to keep in mind the road is not a joke
Red light is turning into green
Tires are spinning and burning
Faster Faster I'm driving my life
Don't try to escape my wheels are commanding my dreams
Listen what I say horsepower through my veins
And fuel to keep my heartbeat
And if you still don't know I was born to win my goals
And this is my road
The ending line is coming near
And once again I win
Faster Faster I'm driving my life
Don't try to escape my wheels are commanding my dreams
After the race I see it clear a feeling of glory is into me
I cannot stop my life goes on and
Deep inside my heart is a V8
Faster Faster I'm driving my life
Don't try to escape my wheels are commanding my dreams
Faster Faster I'm driving my life
Don't try to escape my wheels are commanding my dreams

You gotta keep 'em separated
They're like the latest fashion
They're like a spreading disease
The kids are strappin' on their way to the classroom
Getting weapons with the greatest of ease
The gangs stake out campus locale
And if they catch you slippin' then it's all over pal
If one guy's colors and the other's don't mix
They're gonna bash it up
Bash it up 
Hey man you talkin' back to me
Take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey man you disrespecting me
take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey they don't pay no mind
If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time
Hey come out and play
By the time you hear the siren
It's already too late
One goes to the morgue and the other jail
One guy's wasted and the other's a waste
It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter
No one's learning the score
Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate
Is gonna tie your own rope
Tie your own rope
Tie your own
Hey man you disrespecting me
take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey man you talkin' back to me
take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey don't pay no mind
If you're under 18 you won't be doing any time
Hey come out and play
It goes down the same as the thousand before
No one's getting smarter
No one's learning the score
Your never ending spree of death and violence and hate

Hey man you disrespecting me
take him out
You gotta keep 'em separated
Hey don't pay no mind
If your under 18 you won't be doing any time
Hey come out and playNo puedo mas
Debo irme pronto
Quisierra poder aguantar
Donde estara
La paciencia ahora
Quizas llegue a estallar
Paso la vida en la oscuridad
Me gustaria escapar
Y poder ver
De nuevo el amanecer
Y asi sentir
Que el fuego brota en mi interioir
Podria ser
Un cuento de hada
Y os empeñais en asolar
No perdere
Tiempo con vosotros
Mi fin wsta en otro lugar
Me ire buscando mi esencia
Se que la voy a encontrar
Y podre ver
De nuevo el amanever
Y sentire
Que el fuego brota en mi interior
Que la musica suene
En mi ultima hora
Que nunca pare ese sonido por favor
Que corra la bebida
Quiero ver alegria
Que nadie llore por mi ausencia no no no
No he sido valente ni he sido inteligente
Tampoco lo he pasado mal
No creo que ahora importe ya una mierda
Si laguna vez pude fallar
Recordadme cantando
Sobre un escenario
Viendo las garas de la gente al gritar
Llevando una sonrisa
Por bandera en la vida
Aunque hubo veces en que me visteis llorar
No he sido paciente nunca condescendiente
Tampoco lo he pasado mal
No creo que ahora importe ya una mierda
Si alguna vez pude fallr
Quiera deiros que he esperado siempre una señal
Vosotros la fuisteis no me he dado cuenta hasta el final
Ven a mi
Dejate llevar
Y volemos juntos mas alla
Y veras
Que nada es igual
Que todo a cambiado de verdad
Necesito oir tu voz hablame
Necesito to calor otra vez
Y volver a tener un refugio entre tu piel
Un hogar en que soñar un solo unstante
Y volvera a creer que eres parte de mi ser
Que jamas que nunca habra segunda parte
Mirame
Se que puedes ver
Alos de esperanza otra vez
Prometer
No lo voy a hacer
Quiero un dia a dia y volver
De nuevo a oir to voz hablame
Necesito tu calor otra vez
Tengo miedo a llegar
Llegar al final
Presiento que todo acabara mal
No hago mas que pensar
Que es lo que tu haras
Creo que no se podra odiar mas
Tristeza en tu mirar
No hay orta solucion
Por mas uqe miro a mi alrededor
Despues de caminar
Por la senda que me trajo aquí
Llego el momento en que debo partir
La niebla sigue ahí
Y nubla mi vision de ti
No espero tener tu compasion
En este punto he de saltar
Seguir mi instinto no se a donde llevara
Prefiero vivir en soledad
Que atormentarme por callar
Asi todo se arreglara
Hoy te alehas lentamente hacia el final
Arco iris el la oscuridad
La montaña hoy a dejado de brillar
Tu hambre de cielo se saciara
Un mal sueño del que quiero despertar
A esos lobos encarcelar
Tu sagrado corazon es del metal
Nadie lo robara
Larga vida al rock'n'roll te oi cantar
Como un latido en mi corazon
Levantandome alzo un grito de dolor
El angel ya cato
Tu alma nunca morira
El cielo e infierno se entrelazaran
Desnudo bajo la lluvia llorare
Y caras en la ventana you vere
En sueños a un dragon you matare
La magia de nuevo si escuchare
La mentira esta en primer lugar
Ya no saves ni de que hablar
Siempre creando confusion
En el mundo a tu alrededor
No pienso caer en tu red
Voy a seguir mi instinto
Creo que ahora ire a por ti
No sabes lo que te espera
Te vere
Cayendo al vacio sin red
Creeme que por tu ausencia yo no llorare
No tener
En tu mano el poder
Sevira para que pienses en retroceder
Solo busco vivir en paz
Contigo aquí no ocurrira
Vas a tener que abandobar
No voy a dejarte respirar
Hoy el cielo me oprime
Las estrellas caen sobre mi
Miro al mar y espero ayuda
Sus olas me dicen que no
Probablemente me pudiera ahogar
Seguramente nada sirva ya
Ni el cielo ni el mar
Quiero tus ojos
Ni el cielo ni el mar
Quiero tus besos otra vez
Yoy el viento me dice
Que tu estrella ya se fue
Miro al mar y no puedo esperar nada
Sus olas te llevaron lejos
Y es que no puedo ni volar a por ti
Y es que tampoco quiero ser sin ti
You se que volvere
De nuevo aquí otra vez
Me puede creer
Quiza no puedas ver
Tal vez no quieras ser
Pero aquí estare
Si un precio he de pagar
Mi alma vendere
Se que estare bien
El dia llegara
Se hara mi voluntad
Por fin descansare
Mirad el sol
Vuelve a brillar
Puede ser una señal
Nunca digais
Que no fue verdad
Algun dia tosos sabran
Que volvi
Por amor
A esta tierra gris
Que nadie vuelva a dudar
Que sin ti
Nunca fui
Alguien lleno de ilusion ya nunca
Volver a marchar
Te encontre una noche
Tu vinise a mi
Juntamos las manos
Me senti feliz
Tan solo un instante
Y el tiempo se paro
No podia ni hablarte
Mi voz enmudecio
Ahora te has ido para siempre
Tu alma se encuentra lejos de aquí
Entraste en mi vida de repente
Y ahora no puedo huir de ti
Mi camino lleva a la deriva
De ella no puedo y no se salir
Siempre te he querido en mi vida
Y ahora sin ti yo no quiero vivir
Todo fue tan bello
Casi de ficcion
Nadie esperaba
Lo que ocurrio
Ya de nada vale
Ni pedir perdon
Te fuiste volando
Hacia otro rincon
Alas de gris sinsentido
Probe a cortar el hilo vital
Urgando el la infecta herida
Para burlarse siempre tan mordaz
Revision de la simpleza
Torpe y servil siempre tu seras
Ya he leido todas tus lineas
El letargo no tendra despertar
Quiero que tu veas
A traves de mi
Quiero que me guies
Desde aquí hasta el fin
Quiero que tu sepas
Que se van a hundir
Quiero tu cabeza
Por si pasa
Si podira perderme otra vez
Entre la niebla de un bosque irreal
Pero se que me tenderas la mano
Y otra vez podre mecer
Mis sueños sobre la tranquilidad
Que me dara estar sobre tu regazo
Ya no tien los bufones
Los buenos tiempos llegan al final
Mi ética se ha esfumado
Sus grandes gestos se borraran
Aquel libro polvoriento
En la hoguera lo quemaran
Mi exclusion del aquelarre
Al unicornio desbocaran
Quiero que tu veas
A traves de mi
Quiero que me guies
Desde aquí hasta el fin
Quiero que tu sepas
Que se van a hundir
Quiero tu cabeza
Por si pasa
Si podria perderme otra vez
Entre la niebla de un bosque irreal
Pero se que me tenderas la mano
Y otra vez podre mever
Mis sueños sobre la tranquilidad
Que me dara estar sobre tu regazoLook at the passed time
Someone hoped
Someone cried
Someone died
There's no mercy in the sky
To scape from the past
To forget my mistakes
And to find
A real reason to live
Victory
In my dreams
You've waited too much time
To grow in mine
I'll go on my way
What I need
What I seek
All I want is being second to none
Temple of desire
May your walls be my kingdom
Temple of desire
Change my life in perpetual fire
Temple of desire
Temple of desire
And it's never too late
To realize your mistakes
And your sins
And to lift up your head
I'll go on my way
What I need
What I seek
All I want is being second to none
Each day I ask to myself
Where's the house of God
Each day I try to find it
But I find me all alone
Air Walls of air are falling down
Now this is what I see
Shade of sin
Walking thru the lies
I'm your shade of sin
Running thru the time
Behind the shade of sin
Walking thru the lies
I'm your shade of sin
Shade of sin
Each day I ask your God
Can you save my life
But I haven't found answers
Cause we are afraid to fight
Rage Walls of rage grown in my mind
Madness destruction evil and pain
Will rule again
Each day I wait for the day
In which I'll see my rising force
Grow in the shade of God
To become the biggest storm
Lost I am lost in this burning land
Where the sun is only a dream
Burns my eyes the rage against the world
There's no one who can move my soul
Until I'll be the king of the world I'll fight
Until I'll live my war goes on and on
Take glory with your torment
The hero call my name
Immortal power never die I'm raging
To sing to all songs of immortallity
My eyes full of fire
They know the secret
My eyes full of fire
To live forever
My eyes full of fire
Dying will be better
My eyes full of fire
Than an ignominious life
My hands will become stars
My breath like wind will ride
My shout will burst the doors of
the sky with my hymn
I don't live for living
I live to be the one
Sometimes I make my mistakes
When I think that I live just for love
Destroyed devastated
Will be who believes in holy God
It's time to open your wings
It's time to know the absolute truth
It's time to throw the mask away
And figt against sorrow and fear
Inside the mirror of soul
You'll find the reflection of your life
It's time to watch inside yourself
And to cry for all you have made
To see into the mirror of pain
And you'll recover yourself
Dance with the lifes of your friends
And fly on the land of sadness
Can you see a gleam of light
Can you see in your mind
The revenge of the spirit of wisdom
I believe in your force
And I'm sure that you can
Fight again without fear
To destroy the selfishness in you
Chains around the time
This is the time to liken our secret lives
You love your God your honest world
And now remember that there's only one way
To break the chains with passed time
Don't listen who tells you remain here
Comfortably you'll slowly die
Cause life means fight
And now we know we fight for us
On the edge of life go back or fly
And now we know this is the time
To change the dreams in daily life
Chains around the time
Break the chains before you die
Scream your rage at the sky
Chains around the time
Break the chains before you die
Scream your rage at the sky
Before you die
My majesty The unknown troubles of the world
Don't touch my mind don't make me afraid
Now that I'm seeing what could be my way
I've found the one who gets me away
Immensity The land that I'll conquer in time
From east to west from hell to sky
And I'll stop when I'll take the starway
To get the name of the immortal
To reach for the sky and search a new land
Of wisdom and hope where stone is unscarred
No devastation there's no domination
In front of divine judgement day
Cause the wind will take me away
No genuflection no stupid reaction
In front of the God of the skies
Cause the wind will take my soul
And will take me away
There's no temptation there are no sensations
I'm living in eternal rest
I'll be dust in the wind
To reach for the sky and search a new land
Of wisdom and hope where stone is unscarred
Wherever the wind will call my name I'll be there
Where the wind like a flame burns my eyes
Where the dreams kissed by fire burn my mind
Where the wind like a flame burns my eyes
Where the dreams kissed by fire burn my mind
Neverending wind
Look at the red sunset
When the sky crosses the Nile
Look at the horizon
God came with his temple
Lost in the mist of the past
The secret reamins
It'll never see the light
Under a century of stones
I'll be eternal
Over earth and skies
I'll be immortal
Till the end of time
Like a raven in the sky
Scanning future with my eyes
With the secret you can fly
Till the end of time
Like a raven in the sky
Scanning future with my eyes
With the secret you can fly
Till the end of time
Building the empire
Reinforcing my old secret
You'll know my power
You'll be my slaves forever
We don't know the destination
Like the tears fall from your face
In a lake of lies they're falling
Lost in labyrinth of mind
I want to know the right direction
To find the promised land
I'll escape to search my destiny
Hear the silent cry of black swans
Swimming in a million tears
Searching in a drop of water
To realize my dream to
Ride on the seven seas of life
In the darkened skies of fear
This dream will last forever
Time to forget the blessed wins
In this labyrinth of sin
Your dream could be forever
Everyone gives right solution
To remove the mortal sin
We don't use their sacred answers
I've already plot my way
We're talking about long and endless
Red blood sunsets fading to pale dawn
Like a shady line between the shining day
And the dark one
We're living hand in hand with God
And having our feet through hell's fire
We're talking with already said words
About places where we don't need hands to touch
And we don't need eyes to see
About forests born on dry roots of dead plants
About rivers flowing through the desert
And here there was a woman who
Was showing her reign to me
The sky was her only border
The look was her only limit
And here there were principles against the law
And prisions for honest people
And tribunals for just ones
And here there was fight between the shining bird
And the white natural circle
And selfmade mothers
Sons born by already dead mothers
And this is our reign our life
Beyond the sky
And this is our reign our life
Beyond the sky
Take me where the eagles fly
And wind displays its force against the time
Where legions come from hidden skies
Vengeance and glory get higher and higher
Like sea and wind we've got the absolute power
Thru the desert and mountains
The warriors are coming
Breaking the silent of desolate lands
Take where the heros cry
When kings and dragons rule to spread their might
If you can dream of this land you'll be my guide
We are the fire that burns in your heart
We are the lords of legion of thunder
No one can live and no one can die
Without laws the legion of thunder rules
The legion of thunder rules
With the almighty crown
Over seas and lands
Like the kings of the world
We'll rule forever 'cause
We're the flames of the blazing blood
We've got a dream inside
We're ready to explode
To let it free
The fragments of glass lay shattered on the floor
Children walk on them so innocently
A shroud to cover her miserable dreams
And the wind cries death
I wander on this dark path
In a night where a spirit cries
Here it is eternal winter
And I feel so cold
And the spirit drifts away Here it is eternal winter
And I feel so cold
And the spirit drifts away
Dead flesh paints such a tortured picture
It bleeds as the others but no one pretty like a corpse
As the words escaped your lips
As a murder embraced your heart
It passed on
Left to question the deaths of the composers
A child wonders of his own fate
But angel and devil remain in dead sleep
She in mask and wound
Gazes at where the dream lies
A thorn sleeps in her eye
She stares into the darkness
From behind her cold stone mask
Once I saw a man crawl
His house built on sand
Praydon't let the insects in
It's left to parcha thirsting man pleads
As promises of rain disappear
His desiccated skin withers
Your life means nothing to me
The world under my feet spins around my bed
As I rest in this jail my mind seeks for death
I can't move I can't talk
I can't see I can't love
I can't feel I can't die
I can't breathe I can't cry
Anger Within
Sorrow is me
Unplug me from life just let me die
Switch me off It's time to lay
I can't move I can't talk
I can't see I can't love
I can't feel I can't die
I can't breathe I can't cry
Anger Within
Inside this lifeless coil
Nothing more I feel
Only waiting for death
I can live again
Wrath is burning me
Rage explodes inside
Faith is not my crime
Pain not Jesus is my guide
The Devil's waiting for you to break
When the mist surrounds your heart
He subdues the souls to dark
You cannot hide to the fog that purifies
In the mist of your thoughts
You fight against your soul
In the mist of your mind
Face your fears lose and fall
Locus ubis abdi non est
Nebula pervenit timor prodet
Tuam mentem protegis
Tamen corpus tuus pabulum erit aeternitatis
You dive into midnight mist
Brave and bold of yourself
But its coldness breaks all your shields
Plunges you into obscurity
In the mist of your thoughts
You fight against your soul
In the mist of your mind
Face your fears lose and fall
Nowhere to run or escape to
The mist is here the fear appears
Lock down your mind
To this coming terror world
Cold days ahead
Faithful moments to forget
Under a veil of nihilism
Nobody acts and help
My entrails shuffle in pain
My tears soak my skin
Efforts done in vain
Here awaiting for an end
Please stop this suffering
Put an end to this killing
Because my death brings us to the dark
And my life is all the light you'll ever see
Ego Terra Mater tua sum
Tu filius meus dilectus es quaem tantum amo
Sed etiam actus tui improbi sunt
Et oculos meos secant
Extremus illae spiritus
A woman dying in love
Her bride looks satisfied
Ecstasy arises and explodes
She knows the truth
Her real nature
She can't down it for longer
Her love consumes her body
Extremus illae spiritus
A woman dying in love
Her bride looks satisfied
Ecstasy arises and explodes
Her lips in silence
Are acts of love
But the pain she carries
Hurts like evil in heaven
When the first drops of red
Dye the immaculate white dress
The black ones becomes blood
With the sound of screams
Playing like bells in her ears
Passion and lust are unchained
This is the better way
They will stand forever
United loved and in peace
Mors principium est
Life denies me a breath of air
I'm alone in this immense sea
I have no age but I'm old
My entire life has been so so short
Since I was born I died
Every day in silence
Mankind rejected me
All my life in the shadows
I think I was born
To die this day
Why should I wait
Why should I live
My existence runs to the white light
Now I'm craving for your mercy
I want anything from you except one act
So please do not resuscitate me
The white light on the sky
Grips my soul my mind
I'm flying through the ether
I'm reaching to Thy side
My trip is ending
The white light becomes red
The devil is at my side
Where the Hell am I
Fear every time I see you
Horror every time I feel you
Trapped in a black hole
Prisoner of a scared soul
Thinking of ways to finish
Craving for an end to this
Forced to be slave
Tears made me brave
Fear slave
Tears from the grave
Desire's born from this doom
False hope that now grows
Once again wounded inside
My being consumed as I die
My last wish
Is to rest in peace
Life's enslaved by egoism
Jewels engraved in death
People's sweat is blood
And soil soaks on it
Bitter reward discovery
Brings suffering and blood
Miracles don't exist
Only scape is death
A bullet will end
This shame
With the new day
Crimson skies fall down
And the greed renews its crime
History remains the same
A gem filled up with pain
Shines like a black star
How much bodies will break
For a desire without end
Red drops everywhere
Black tears out of there
Thousand winters ago
The Moon needed love
She undressed her silhouette
Lust was unchained
Tragedy and Moon
Shadows and light
Phobos cried for her love
And she was pleased
But the Sun wanted her heart
Disaster came to planetary
Tragedy and Moon
Shadows and light
And the war started
Suffering the Light's revenge
All the planets and moons
Were submitted into the depths of Hell
Horror and fear shadows comes
Black Hole the one that will prevail Pray loud
Phobos destroyed by his rage 
Snow will cover all the Earth Ice age
Tragaedia lunaque
Una incorruptorum amantiorum fabula

Tragaedia lunaque
Una incorruptorum amantiorum fabula
Mundi res gestale
Amoris perpetui monumentumNot long agoin mind
we picked our choice
and we gathered together
greeted nature by storm
our bodies layed down
as we fell
And our faces turned
away from the earth
we trembled into the
world of dreams
The cradle of imagination
Our knowledge was complete
all our needs fulfilled
we could not feel
a fairytale so unreal for adventures like me and you being nothing but
shadows of our mortal selves I a way I perceive myself as my own god my
own master and my own slave I am but a thrall towards my own desires Just
when it all seems so hopelessly to break free from what I have done I will
try do it all over again and flow
with the waves like the
sun I draw parallels
between intuitions and
instincts I carried since
dawn when dusk
comes I would like
to see I was wrong
though I still am a
thrall towards my own
desires
oceans of infinity
one shall seldom witness
such forces in motion
one shall seldom take
their part
we join and we
breath genesis and
revelation
whatever that happened as
we came along
for we stepped into
what we had remembered
as the world of dreams
the source of imagination
we crawled out from
our drunken sleep
though we could not understand
from heaven to hell
one shall seldom
witness such forces
in motion
one shall seldom
take their part
we joined and breathed
genesis and revelation
whatever that happened
like an infant still
crawling in it's mother's
womb A jesus christ
whom never left
Not long ago in mind
we picked our choice
gathered together and
greeted nature by storm
from heaven to hell
from all to none
and father to son
My eyes are closed
I feel alone
there is something
inside me
dripping and screaming
how can I feel love
when love was something
I never had
talk to medo you know
me and who I am
I am your flesh
remember me
tell me who I am
and I will tell you
what is behind that
door there is a child
who is waiting for you
No one to touch
no one to hold
I am alone fighting
against this disease
I lost my eyes
I lost my head
I lost my flesh and
my heart
who made me you made me
I lost my blood
I lost my love
I lost my feelings and
I am losing my mind
The child's blood was made
by you do not blame him
the killing were made by you
do not blame him
Closed my eyes left me
aloneremember
A drug composed with
the things that you do
drowning in words though
they never came through
The moment that your senses play a part
when all of them caress a new impression
Somewhere deep within your heart
like qualities of permanent obsession
Can you conquer your emotional delay
can you draw tomorrow's history today
can you feel the tide is turning
can you overcome the yearning
or will you blindly obey
Break throughembrace the light of Kairos
Behaving unwillingly like a recording machine
All these emotional standards reduced to leftovers of a dream
Is everything just like it seemed to be
moments ago who am I where have I been
and how will I know
Have you ever had a date with an oracle
that told you some of her secrets
The only breed in the following term
share them with reasoning creatures
what if and you won't know anything
about it before you doif you have
if the earth was a willow
and you were one too
would earth be weeping
so gentle and true
if i was the garden
whereas you could grow
would you hand me your brAnches
and grant me your love
in between the lines of your storyflowing through
the pages of a book so well prepared the
words leave more than ashes from your pencil
when it speaks of tiny stories that happened
through these years
I swear that your present realitydisillusioned
obscurity will gently wipe away the tears
of wasted seeds
how Can we go through this
with wounded wing before we learned how to fly
how can i control desires
when desires burns on a chilly autumn Night
i will try and make you imagine
the aura where they stand
is filled with little secrets
as written in the sand
Naked as a child at birth
a question in disguise
an oasis in a lonely desert
where lonely unknown lands lie
from here and into infinity
humble and timeless
philosophyyou gently wept away the tears
of wasted seeds
all the days that have left me
and the species i have seen
ahead days will follow
it was only a dream
though my garden is growing
under skies out of blue
and it changes Each season
both in colours and in truth
you should know that a willow
a weeping bed's pillow
until all days are through
the rain that fall on your branches
Just yearning
for a source to feed it's primal need
can maKe your beauty blossom from within
with flowers blowing
in the windand in seasons to follow
These eyes do you hide behind these
cold blue eyes
I know I want to know
The light driven by the pale blue skies
I go where to go
Despised and driven by
these echoed eyes
I know where to go
A sign written by
these tear stained eyes
I go do go
blurred were my eyelines hindering
to touch omnio
so let me belong eat me raw
stick me empty
with your hungry clawsbring me light
can you feel the tension
set me free from this sleep
leave me be to
judge my own creationbring me love
and as I burned my fragile skin
touched omnio
All this can not go on anymore
these thorns
they tear me to pieces
The sign is given your sign is given
I am illusioned
feed my lust and hungermy addiction
the thought of a
naked appearance facing
the rest of the world left me in
chaosa prey without a common address
drowning in salt water can do
nothing at all
I am left here begging for mercy
In this room when I found images of
poetry I lost my deed my shelter and
my pain did they leave you
unstained
you may swallow all my precious lies
you may stay and you may follow me
further down the thin and
crumbling line
I bleed for my loss and hunger
my addiction
though the thought of a
naked appearance
leave in me the wonders and words
Can burdens relieve me from slumber
in unpleasant worlds
Can the essence of bone regard me
rebirth
These eyes did I die behind these
cold blue eyes Did I know
where to go
This light eclipsed in a worn disguise
did glow even though my cries were
driven by
those echoed lies No where to roam
Open my eyes enlightened
the child that
whispered bardo omnio
Let me belong eat my raw
stick me empty with
your hungry clawsbring me light
can you feel the tension burning
The soundtrack of our lives
on an early April morning
may be able to redefine
the standards of this restless emptiness
Carved out of velvet draped in truth
to reach omnio
Let me be strong let me
draw all the lines
that fall upon the floorbring me life
let me feel electric tension
I am greater taller and a thousand times
smaller
From a ghost that told you where to go
to a piece of flesh that need to know
And as I turned my fragile skin
I reached omnio
I have gathered bricks throughout a
lifetime
to build a house where I will live
The door is where I write these words
the window where I forgive
Restlessly I searched the hallway
for the truth of yesterday
But changes cast their ugly shadows
the basement is there host today
is this the omnio
I have been searching forOltre l'infinito
oltre il silenzio
al di là dell'oblio
fino all'uomo
Nascita paradiso primordiale dell'essenza
vita tortuosa nientità estrema
esistenza e realtà
dell'etterno essere
dell'etterno credere
dall'unione amniotica del tutto
traggo simbiotica armonia
e nell' amabile sacrificio
torna inconfutabile la vita
dal dolore del piacere
si compie l' etterno dovere
e immutabile nel suo divenire
torna inconfutabile l'essere
Guarda la vita che danza
con la morte nera signora
giudice e giullare dell' eterna follia
danzagiraballadanza
è triste e malinconico
il tutto torna a me
lontano e vicino
il pianto si unisce al riso
Follia
nel nome dell'ego si conclude l'io
nel nome dell'essere si immortala il cosmo
nel nome dell'io si conclude l'ego
l'energie dissipate per il divenire
che la danza continui
con lei che mi tende la mano
e mi sussurra echi lontani
freddi e caldi della verità pura
etterno misantropico dolore
quiescenza estatica di un'obliata armonia
morta sepolta vita infinita
danza remota di un antico rito
Solitudine antica emozione
passione eterna mistificata
dell'amato fuoco dell'erezione
il fluido concettuale del volere
pervade l'anima subliminata
nell'ancestrale atto del dovere
finita è l'infinita estasi mentale
dall'istinto sorge immacolata
l'ultima processione finaleFalling leaves lost in time 
Regret confounds 
Spring ahead fall behind 
We struggle to turn it around 
Cold horizon concrete and steel 
This is where we lost our souls 
They tried to warn us but greed appealed 
We lost sight of the common goal 
Poor of spirit full of fortune 
They move to the front of the line 
Blind to all but number one 
We pay we slaves to the grind 
One by one we come undone We pray to the dollar sign 
Day by day in cash we trust We live in the killing time 
Too much power too much wealth 
Hey brother can you spare a dime 
Corporate think rules the day 
It's best for the bottom line 
Born to service to serve them well 
The carrot dangles on the merry go round 
Manipulation a way of life 
The wizard will see you now 
One by one we come undone We pray to the dollar sign 
Day by day in cash we trust We live in the killing time 
It's all too much how can it last 
This crazy world turns far too fast 
Anxiety gets in the way 
We hold on tight for better days 
Cold horizon concrete and steel 
This is where we lost our soul 
They tried to warn us but greed appealed 
We lost sight of the common goal 
One by one we come undone We pray to the dollar sign 
Day by day in cash we trust We live in the killing time 
Falling leaves lost in time 
Regret confounds 
Spring ahead fall behind 
We struggle to turn it aroundCold and gelidthis wind carries away my soul and my heart to a way no longer mine
Time is still from a century and my feelings with itclosed aeons ago in a cold crystal that can no longer shrine
Cold are my soul and my lost remembrance that from years drive what remains to a strangedark oblivion
Blood and life don't flow in my white and pale skin
Like a statue disenable to live to love to exist
Strange forces encircle mewith me they join
Sanguis in aeternum funditur
Crescit in mundo vita
Sanguis in aeternum funditur
Mors rapit filios in umbris
Sanguis in aeternum funditur
Crescit in mundo vita
Sanguis in aeternum funditur
Vi Sanguinis ad vitam redeo
Two souls from long moments finally meet each other in a new dimension
Cries my heart and the blood's flowing breaks and melt my ice
A sense of eternal peace of life and death contains my strange existence
as finally a circle already know closes itselfand with it an history
forever carved in life's blood
Sad roundaboutas life passes by
Lost thoughts melted with my memories
and my passionsand my aspirations
all gone
as the roundabout turns around
Like a child laughing and crying in the shadows of a life spent in ignorance
A great void surrounds me while she entangles and absorbs my mind
Unaware of our conditionsilentwe stroll in the garden of sadness and desperation
Nowa passing life will lead to another
And our futile tears are balm drops lost in the stream of life
And our painful thoughts are dead leaves brought away by the wind
But now I must go away far from this perenial wheel
that will turn eternallydriven be each of our stories
Mother I'm lying in the dustI've forgotten what I am
I don't know what I'll be
The day you gave me the first dawn has been for you the last dusk
Along impassable paths I've roamed and now I sense the end
A never grown child comes back to you
A soul too tired because of living too tired to flee away another time
to search a new way without you
Desolated alonein the shadows of loneliness he stares
Only the weight of an immense void in his heart as he looks the seraphic gaze of the angel
Every step is a bitter tear every trampled leaf a torn in his palm
Fallen in the mud he lays cryinga handful of dead leaves in his hand
lurking to reach the statueto touch his lost love only once more
Only the weight of an immense void of handful of dead leaves in his hand
Slowly my body embraces the feet of this statue so cold in a november day
My flesh and my spirit finally chilled
Now I face the endI'm part of youI'm lost with you in an eternal embrace
The final shine of this light eternalthe spiritual union at the end
Welcome my sweet childdon't cry my son because you have suffered too muchdon't cry
your mother forever with you shall be
Windpenetrate in me
Bring this soul far away
Because for too much time my wings have been still
Awaiting the dawnthe light that will be
On this shining ray I want to live eternally
To be the one I was an angel without wings staring at the sun
My forgotten homeland
Blood and supreme virtues burn in this long and intense night in which good and evil fight for the
Absolute Truth
Now has been fulfilled the fate of an ephemeral past that will return
Ghosts and shadows dwell in this immense walls
and to them they dedicate all their ardour
Pride and courage flow in this prime and ancient battle
To it they grant eternal life
An old and ancestral rite has been celebrated in this grandiose fatal place
Is the end and the beginning of a great dream that none has accepted
Or is it an ancient story
And there
Grow power and energy
Destiny is now bornwith itall of usgenerated in an instant in the immense and Abolute Bulwark
To be granted of eternal life
Dark and tearingthe sound of a world that irradiate my dimension
Melancholy and sadnessbehind the veil of this old Earth without hope
This entity approaches me and grazes my life
Destiny attracts it to a new birth
Obscurity and anguish dissolve and with them the distance between the two bodies
A wake of wisdom and purity envelopes the celestial encounter to seal an ancient and arcane joining
The passage is openwith it the hope of all grief's end
My life spent in a moment and my wishes all broken
My false hopes are crumbled in the dustthis presence is finally gone
It will proceed with the comet and lets me alone with its thick wake of tears and passions
Satan I invoke
Lucifer I call
Berith one of war
Hymns of battle roar
Flesh of Christians rip
Blood of feeble drip
Bones are burnt to ash
All in name of Satan
Realm of Christ will fall
Underworld shall rise
Reign upon the light
Ancient rite of war
Beast of fire speaks
Hell's gates open wide
Death of holy sons
Sacred graves open
I am the one that is summoning thee through the powers and the forces of Satan
I am the one that is calling for rites for the gathering of holy burnings
Dark moon in the blackest skies I call upon your presence for wisdom
All in a circle of wicked rites blood of the virgin shall drip tonight
Starlight from the cosmic sea shines upon the blood soaked altar
Unholy fire that burns up high on the head of the ancient horned goat king
Pleasure of the sacrifice brings us might strength of a beast we are given
All in a circle of wicked rites blood of the virgin shall drip tonight
Lord in the heavens we deny followers of you we despise
We are the ones born of fire element of earth you must fear
Now is the time to worship death through the sacrifice of the holy bitch
All in a circle of wicked rites blood of the virgin shall drip tonight
Come to the cryptic tombs hear their call
Fire rises up high from the mouth of Hell
Strong as iron and steel I attack with hate
Dark legions in service of Satan strike with lethal fate
Destroy sons of Christ  Attack sons of Christ
Rise of the sharpest blade prepare for war
Lords of the Heathen ones grant us might
With pride we stand up strong claim our ways
Strike of the morning star obliterates
Destroy sons of Christ  Attack sons of Christ
Exterminate them annihilate them exterminate them annihilate them
Destroy sons of Christ  Attack sons of Christ
March to the sounds of war soldiers of Satan
March to the sounds of lightning sons of Thor
Power of fire and ice inverts the cross
Blood runs down the hills from synagogues
Destroy sons of Christ  Attack sons of Christ
Through the cosmos demons fly as a dark star killing light
Universe without an end opens gates that lead beyond
Oh death take me now may my soul become of dust
Majesty as old as time when beginning was the end
Master of the ancient war where the angels fall below
Darkness of unholy kingdom  shadows of Lord Satan's throne
We of fire wind and moon call to you
I am summoned to your realm where you rise as Lord of Hell
Chanting winds of burning skies moan forever
High upon spheres of glass our majesty shall rise again
Beneath the battlefields burns the fire of the ancients
I call upon the demons Abbadon Berith and Satan
As the blaze of the ancient cult burns the enemy with hatred
Holy trinity of God I trample on your faces
Cryptic tombs in the earth open for the lambs of Jesus
Morning star in the sky shine upon the earth your forces
Big as a moon bright as a star strong like the wind I kill you
To you I bring this ritual  Infernal Evocation Of Torment
As the blaze of the ancient cult burns the enemy with hatred
Holy trinity of God I trample on your faces
Dark flames of the blackest thrones illuminate the skies of a crescent moon
Like the sea with titanic waves enemies of God will sink you
Melancholy moan of mystic wind
Melodies of sadness that sing the hymn
Towers casting shadows over graves of loan
Fire on the torches now dies with gloom
Walking on a path of lonesome doom
Silence of a night when death arrives
Travel through the tunnel when life shall end
Never finding light at the end
Symphony plays music of the dead and darkness sings
Funeral chants wicked lord of song and words of sorrow
Pagans dance holding black torches as a symbol of death
Lonesome tomb summons me to eternal realms
Master Satan king of Inferno
Whisper to me spells that annihilate
Black goat urine fills a human skull
Menstrual black blood drips on the altar
Candles of black made from human fat
Infants crucified throats cut skin peeled
Nefarious dismal orations magical words of the elite
Nefarious dismal orations gather stand and hail
Nefarious dismal orations the sound of Satan's cult
Ancient rites of passage as the members sing
Black nocturnal skies embrace the full moon light
Now I sing to masters that obey my call await
Praise the symbol of Satan's might bow before the darkest light
Hold the torch and chant with pride as the bells chime tonight we rise
Dancing in shadows casting dark spells where the holy ones hide
Mystical fire shining on the altar of the ancient king
Enter the cult follow the ways of the left hand path
Trample on the cross praise the pentagram and all Hail Satan
Bray the horns of shining bronze songs for rites on full moon nights
Far in lonesome woodland realms stands the temple of the cult
Dancing in shadows casting dark spells where the holy ones hide
Mystical fire shining on the altar of the ancient king
Enter the cult follow the ways of the left hand path
Trample on the cross praise the pentagram and all Hail Satan
On the darkest mountain peaks where the black winds carry me
There I stand and sing this hymn to the sounds of infernal bellsLet my total will be done

The congregation has betrayed against the empire captured
I cannot resist my Doom impregnated
The cursed son of Nazarene profanation
Holocaust by the fire of hatred
I'm intoxicated with the cross impiled on my belly
Corporal celebration the beginning of the end captured
I am made to confess all my deadly sins coproral celebration
The fall of the empire the first bell tolls
The beasts start to devour my flesh
Master of the damned damned at his birth
Let the children know their fates
master
Torturer strangled my neck twisted
Bringer of incineration please burn my body parts
My body parts still moving to beg of my lord a blessing
Incriminations I bleed for my lord
by your spell I die your spell is my wish
Incrimination I bleed for my lord
by your spell I die your spell is my wish
I'm the lamb of my lord my lord is Satan
I'm walking the path to the guillotine
The beast arises in my with wicked sickness
The last bell tolls Colloseum is in ecstasy
Malleus Malleficarum Scripture for the torturer
All of the innocent suspects are butchered by the lord of flies
He is called Beelzebuh the tyrant who lost his sanity
Gaze into the fire of nocturne now the ceremonious trial begins
Anatomy of the beast their agonies are his pleasure
Their corpses rip to pieces even God cannot be saviour
Anatomy of the beast anatomized with cult
Soon all their wishes turn into desperation
Disgrace for the creations of God
Foul odor of mangled torsos
Death awaits but the trials continue everlasting
They are captured by the cycle of rebirth
Called by siren enchanting queen of paradise
Gehenna a place for punishment gaze into the fire of nocturne
Dragged intestines are still moving like dying red serpents
Dying but still alive ceremonious trials repeats again
Pulled out embryos they are eaten in their sleep
Children full of hate offering for the lord of flies
Behind the mirror I saw my lamentable fate
Evil lilith blazing red astrologer weeping apparition in my dream
Terrified destined as Baal Amon Amy Gaap Necromancy is my will
Unforeseen unknown under the clouds I collapse
Whe whispered look at the children pregnant women
Nemesis' sickness is eary Gomory is slave of gold
Luxurious way virtue
Sodomize all of paradise capture all of saints
hades' darkage comes
Antichrist's profanation Beelzebub and Satan's lineage
the incarnation of desperate
Rhadamanthus judge Alastor execute at the gate of hell
Lightning strike across the sky all false kings were swept
Under the cross I beg for mercy Alastor's sadness alas
Most evil beast menaces christians butchering them the most evil way
Occultic number of Sun Daemon dark moon of temptation
Obsessed by an unholy sickness
The cries of christians echoed
Satan looking down from Pandemonium
The whole creation is blasphemied and disgraced
Offer the fresh human meat
Infernal cannibalism is chaos
Baphomet smiled after vomiting his intestines
They squirm like grotesque tentacles
They rape all sacrifices
Insult violate
Baptism in blood a violate end
There's no exist for the bound and sacrificed
Bared entrails dangled intestines
Intoxicated by their beauty
Mangled fleshless torsos are spat from their mouths to cunt
They are exposed as the monuments
Blasphemy to the grace of God
Lucifer struggled to devour the fresh entrails
Fresh human meat blood dripping from the fresh feast
In the cursed Sodom a cannibal land
an untrodden lost paradise
Baphomet smiled after vomisting his intestines
They squirm like grotesque tentacles
They rape all sacrifices
Rapture sacrifice
behind the mirror I saw End
When dusk deepened around where once stood eden
Immortality rampant no psalm remains
They ask for sensual luxuries they gasped in primitive caresses
Everywhere is death along the poisoned sea of blood
All the virgins are raped butchered dismembered
Reduced to a torso my lust is drawn with blood
Armageddon they know the end is near
No grave scriptures are burned no request will be granted
The false gods insane
They drooled from their smiles when they saw the blood
They flung their sperm into the womb of the torso
She conceived crations they grew
Painful spawn so grotesque rips her cunt that breeds apart
Breathing beings in a breathless lifelss body
Eat the broken organs remove them with cannibalistic instincts
The jellied substance they spew out the cursed creations are born
The Gods trembled with fear desperate and weeping
The cursed creations grew the Gods felt regret
but too late
My darkened nightmare the visions of forgotten paradise
Ancient gods are buried under the frozen tombs
Cruel reign of fear the ultimate inhumanity
Martyrdom from within as the anatomists are masked black
The darkland I rule I am the almighty new king
I need new sacrifices to fulfill my lust
No shelter from your doom you all shall die by my judgement
I set fire to the forest of eternity
but my mission is far from complete
I must receive
Out from the eternal darkness
Entering the core of his aureole
Born into the kingdom of the damned
I know I must curse those blessed
I am the new unholy king
The unblessed child of my father Baal
I am reincarnated as a symbol of hatred
I rule where their Gods cry
All holy spirits are gone
No Gods shall live no life shall rise
Immorated obsessed a relic of the ancient faith
Diabolic spells they intoxicated
Raped submissive witch conceive the animus
Mutilated womb a creation of incest
Sodomite insult serpents in his anus and mouth
Nymphomaniac hang her upside down and gut her
Drowned in the sea of blood
The sea known as lament
The eternal life they have is an everlasting atonement
The survivors are suffocated by the reek of spoilage
I cannot handle my madness no souls can seize me
I rule the kingdom I am the child of Baal
I am reincarnated as a symbol of despair
Blazing mighty stars dyed red
The witch spawned the child of doom
She writhed around the altar in pain from her mangled belly
I thrusted my scythe and pulled her child out
The carnal rite climaxed
I ate his raw flesh
The world is full of shit
Gamygyn let him know
Hear their Gods crying
They die and are reborn to die
A place their Gods left behind
Bleeding crosses are burned
They are wiped by my vomited intestine
The dark moon is alight but no light appears
A place their Gods left behind
Evil night in rain the sacred rite begins
Rule the cursed creations stride their corpses
Sacrifise and old king betrayal of the wisemen
We praise the ascension of the tyrant
Rip open your womb pull out the unborn children
Hang their meat on a hook offer them to the tyrant
Dig out your intestines to fill an argent tray
Scatter the foul blood dye the altar red
In the sadistic last supper
Tied slowly you die
Butchered and ripped from her cunt
Your rotten meat shredded
The tyrant drooled to see you
He laughed at your painful rotting body
He peeled open your organ crushed
You die stained with shit
The tyrant drooled to see you
Striding a pile of bloody corpses
Born in 1900 born to be a man
My smile is my disguise but inside angry and sore
I think I might go crazy I am feeling kind a weak
I want to be alone I am ready for death
I press the knife into my wrist
And I hear my blood pour out
As the stars come out
Need to meet a god
I am lost in my own world
There is nowhere to hide
No hope in my life
I like to taste pain
My fear is your fear
There is nowherenowhere to hide
Once again I'm praying 'cause I'm looking for a god
I need someone to trust I try to clear my mind
I need some time to think my mind is going blank
Like a tear down on my face I am on a road to death
Questions burning in my mind
Do you love me as I am
With my sins and devotion
Please give me absolution
YeahhhhI gaze into your eyes
Yeahhhhtry to feel your mind
In the light of the day I can see your face
I listen to your voice you whisper my name
II need your help your guiding hand
Pleaseplease give me strength to bear my scars
There's a poison in my brain
You kiss me on my head
Underneath this pale gray sky
Can you tell me your secret
Flames over the cell
Burned by the rising sun
It's always the same
Breaking chains it's time to run
You feelhow in my life was I wrong
You giveme what I could never have
Now that I'm falling
Is it infinity
Oris it a trap
A memory breakdown You feel
You feelhow in my life I was wrong
You giveme what I could never have
Fightwe don't live to find answers
We are here just to question this life
This human life  illusion
Fightwe can't find find a key
Can we reach reality are we
Are we ghosts dust in the wind
Flames over the cell
I'm burned by the rising sun
It's always the same
Breaking chains it's time to run
You feelhow in my life was I wrong
You giveme what I could never have
There is no easy life
When this silence surrounds us
It's raining in my eyes
To live is now too much for me
Fight
Five hundred and fiftyfive
We don't live to find answers
We are just to question this life
This human life illusion
Can we reach reality
Are we ghosts
Are we ghosts Dust in the wind
It's time for redemption
When you're flying away to the stars
I was wandering like a ghost
With no place to run
The net is closing in
Trapped in this dead end
Chorus
The solace the end I
Await
The solace the end I
Await
Take me ohWith your soul I play
Take me nowShe is made of clay
Just a miracleYou are nothing but a pawn now
Life's a giant cemetery
The illusion's to believe
That we can't get out of this place
When we only leave the grave
Wait a minute my son
I'll make your dream come true
You' re nothing but a pawn
You' re in my hands now
Now I can't believe my eyes
Has he heard my voice
This so familiar shadow
Coming from the fog
Thanks my God show me now
Say what you burn in my head
Say what you are in this hell
In the icy world of old desperate souls
The first bullet flew to the wheel of chance
The second one could have been for vengeance
And the last one taken as evidence
Fight I can't fight again
Here is the pain in my veins
Fight I can't fight no more
fight in the light of the fire
In the dead heart of this tortured life
A gun was better than a knife
But what I did
I can't remember
Did I really kill
During December 
In the cold night
The next one was no doubt a stray bullet
Flying so fast in the heat of the night
The fifth was the result of a gangland killing
The sixth shouldn't have killed that poor victim
Down now
I can only move my eyes
Down now
I feel a burning in my heart
Down now
I can't manage to think
About now the dead man could finally be
Since the day you made me die
The witch opened my eyes
And told me Steal his power
You'll rise from your ashes
I feel the earth beneath my feet
I will reach Heaven's gates
And I will face the dark one
And burn his dirty mind
With the passing of time
I will reclaim
My life with her
With the passing of time
I'll be the strongest
I promise you I'll make you cry
And soon you will implore
You will be the king no more
Of your kingdom of pain
You'll end up six feet under
I will dispose of you
You can't reenter my life
You'll be just a bad memory
Since the mournful day she died
I've committed no crime
I'm living with my black heart
Huddled up like a child
Gold dust underneath my feet
I'll reach Heaven's gates
I'm living by the black light
I sense the smell of blood
I remember her dress of blood
My face drowning in there
Just screaming in the black night
Praying not to be there
Heartache pain  all that remain
It's raining in my heart
I can still hear their sad barks
Of the dogs of hell
I can't turn around
Death's ghost is behind
I can't go away
I need to cast off my bonds
I can't live
I can play
By the Devil's rules
But I can't like a game
When the dice are loaded
By a sadistic cheater
I can play with madness
But I can't bring her back
Back to life
My heart spills out all over the floor
I don't want to live anymore
I only stay in the dark
I cry every blessed day
I won't say that I'm innocent
But I've paid for my crimes
I have explored my dark side
I'm very close to death
Looking for a sign
Just can't remember
Walking the line
Between life  death
Smelling the flesh
An incense of sacrifice
He talks of a time
That wasn't my life
He reads in my mind
Things I could deny
Is it a crime
Am I really the chosen one
Here in the dark
Sounds behind me like gun shots
There in the mark
I can read The End
She talks about lies
Of all those past days
She reads in my eyes
How fed up I was
For her it's a deal
No pain no more change in my life
Here in the dark
Sounds behind me like gun shots
There in the mark
I can read The End
When I entered the darkness
I saw the merciless man
He said Come on take my hand
Welcome to my wonderland
When I feel into the darkness
This old man that some call madness
Just said Hey Bring me some heads
Welcome to my wonderland
I'm looking for a sign
I just can't remember
It smells here like sacrifice
Welcome to my wonderland
Here in the dark
Sounds behind me like gun shots
There in the mark
I can read The End
At first I open just one eye
I feel that I'm groggy and I
Can hardly move
Death is sitting next to me
This red face of the woman that
I love more than anything
I can't manage to realize
I fall out of the car and I
I throw up
I gotta know
I gotta ride
If I am dead or still alive
Beyond the night beyond the crash
I gotta know
I gotta ride
If I am dead or still alive
Beyond the night beyond the crash
Beyond the other side
I feel a presence inside me
I can hear No don't be afraid
I am the Ancestor
At the crossroads of eternity
I'm here to protect you because
They have unfortunately died
But you will not be alone
Look for your guardian angel
Believe
When I jump into my car I turn the volume up
I shake my head against the beat then I can feel my pulse
The sign of living fast
Hear my motor purr
Get right get right
The race is my religion the steering wheel my heart
I know I am burning my life I'm sitting near to Death
Screaming at the windscreen
It's more than I can bear
Get right get right
Hear the crushing steel tears in my eyes
Where is my glory I feel so sad
Start to make the wheels squeal I love this sound of pain
Suddenly I felt the wind blow into my head
Then I saw a man
And I heard his voice
He's dying he's dying
It was on a Friday morning
And on a foggy street
On the road I could see
The lorry of Death seeming to rise from nowhere
Alone in the waves of time
Looking for which way is mine
I'm down and Im totally poor
I am the slave of chance
Losing control of my brain
I feel I'm losing my mind
I see the shadows of rain
In the land of illusion
Tell me what you are
You play you say
You lie about her
You play with my mind
Are these streets my only home
Degradation my family
From where comes this wild horse
What choice between these two doors
In this mirror I see my life
In her eyes I see my double
She desires my soul and he craves my blood
The time of sacrifice
Your sins are a kingdom I've seen before
Was I at this time a fool or a king
Light   light of heaven
Flames   flames of hell now
I can't decide where I'll end
End my life
Tell me what you are
You play you say
You lie about her
You play with my mind
Now in the flames of this hell
I forget all of my pain
Ready to take this cold hand
His blood flowing through my veinsThey wipe us out they rip us out
One by one in the dead of the night
Fight for the land fight with bare hands
The auctioned human rights are scorned
Defiance and resistance
Conspiracy fortified
They kill us one by one
and dance in the dark of the night
The ambivalence a double perception
A massacre or a suicide mission
Searchlight kill on the night
Horrors of our motherland
History or mystery play
Obscure oblivion
Searchlight kill
Searchlight kill
Idealists leaders are erased
families were emptied
East and West this mutual blood shed
Truthful lies textbooks are to be fed
Searchlight kill on the night
Horrors of our motherland
History or mystery play
Obscure oblivion
The vultures are calling
They are heroes we were the might
The combing affect our treasures
In the dreadful night
let the parasite speak
out of the womb of sleep
The weak had been born when a darkness spawned
a brainchild of schizophrenic who was dispatched prototyped synthesized
the flux in cortex synapses fail and relapse
the dogma of sickness and remedy collapse
Surgeon slowly burgeon chemical memories and electronic truth
What the fuck means all now
nerves numb psychosis unleashed
a symptom of killing spree
Welcome to my hell
silence endeavors climax
surgery is made to surgeon
fuck you I am the fluid
 blow your head with my bludgeon
Death was before me
I had to cheat to survive
The bed and the chair was all that I feared
Behind the bars of madness and lunacy
It was my life and this fucking fallacy
I fly and fly away
out of the misery
extraterrestrial stories
and brainless melody
Raped and fucked in thresholds of time
whores and bastards in my breeding rhyme
fuck you are mine your death be like a swine
welcome to the hell of my cyborg mind
Raped and fucked in thresholds of time
Whores and bastards in my breeding rhyme
Fuck you are mine your death be like a swine
Welcome to the hell of my cyborg mind
 Motherfucker
The sun bleaches out of the horizon
I see stars in a crimson black
Fiery eyes of the monster I see in me
I know I have to win
The sound of the nature
You hear as the bird's clamor
Bringing down to the symphony of bliss
flowers bloom with a morning kiss
Rise  Rise My soldiers rise 
Rise Rise till The dried leaves fall
Rise Rise  feel the victory in you 
Rise  Rise  And all turns so evergreen
Silent kill A nationwide
A lullaby of matricide
Takeover takeover overruled
Corporeal punishment ensued
The klaxon deaf ears to blood
Riot strikes in a flare
Under black we march
Smokes and gun powders in the air
Hear me I call you
I bring the tide of vengeance
I bring the bolts of power
Bequeath hatred and fear
Doomsday knock at your door
Repentance nevermore  
Terrorize the city
bomb roads blast thunders
I am the bolts of Jove
I am the hellfire 
I am bring the wrath of God
and you will run for lives
This is the Judgement Machine
Ready for impact
Kill 
Kill the killer
Murder
Murder the murderer
Rape the rapist
Rule the ruler
Glory overthrown
with bolts of fucking power
It was so cold when the breeze froze me
I waited till the midnight came
The moon showed its somber beauty
Welcoming you from hell
You wore a blood soaked gown
I held the black rose a resembling of your face
The perfume that you wore
Spellbound my or our desire
I saw the silhouette of her darkness
as the lake ran red and wild
I broke the thousand streams
and the night turned so vile
The wolves had started howling for me now
But I could not run anymore
I had to see you rise again
from the bed made of rock
I would call for the ravens
and they would fly above the sky
wings recovered my body
as I unearthed you
Fluorescence of my angel
come back to portray
the world where I live
recall me back to life or death
Let me tell you through the stories of
The Betaal Panchvimshati
25 pieces of puzzles
Recycling with questions and mysteries
Or you want to hear the nightmare
The tale of the spectral bride
with the bangles beauty she traps you
we call her the mother of all disguise
the Amavashya lore
tales of the new moon night
the Amavashya lore 
the book of demise
Shankhachurni  Fear her eyes
Her bloody gaze and that wicked smile
She is coming right behind you
Dressed as an astounding lie
If you know the plight of the fishermen
where they encounter with a blurry fog
It's Aleya the shadowy beings
and soon they lose the compass and drown
the Amavashya lore
tales of the new moon night
the Amavashya lore 
the book of demise
I knocked her door one day
She though I was her pizza man
But No I crashed and I crashed in so deep
Her young eyes were two galaxies to me
Death cannot do us apart
Eternity will be us
We are the Forever
and I entitle you
The queen of my heart
We are the forever
End is never to come
The Lake ran red and cold
who cares for it anymore
The day has come with a new sun
My angel knocks at my door
Don't take my gravity of anger
I will rip out all the walls
between us if it does
dare to stand
Sweeter than the winter
A light in the dark
I morph myself to her
A newborn me arise
We are the forever
Forever and Ever
End is never to come
We are eternal
We are the forever
End is never to come
Together as one
We burn the rest of the world
Democratic law has bound the world in peace
A peace of scattered deaths
On father's shoulder rise
The coffin of his child
Smiles and kites blurred
into a air strike
Indecent government had to reveal
Innocent living beings in bigoted civil kill
Reach out to fight to rise from the ending days that are beneath veil of clockwork
Coming out of fear to win your land from torments that are done by the despot
Milhemat Sheshet Ha Ya Mim
Six days had plundered voice of the weak
A Thunder that torn
Asunder singular black flag
Again a sarcastic world
Peace sustained in stains
We see the fireworks in view of their night
But not of celebration which was a heinous genocide
Reach out to fight to rise from the ending days that are beneath veil of clockwork
Coming out of fear to win your land from torments that are done by the despot
This silence Soothes Away
As I had wondered what we are really fighting for
Why humanity is ignored
The children cry why don't you hear
The ethereal watcher is here why don't you fear
we are the fallen
in this world alone
Reunite once again
to crush the iron dome
Welcome to the land of questions
Welcome to the isle of lore
Where the veil came crumbling down
There it all began
The germination
Unveiling a cryptic door
There it was revealed
Hopes and aspirations
Unclosing an enthralled door
Escalate the sense
Enhancing to join the dawn
I close my eyes Inis Mona
And reminisce of those palmy days
I moon o'er you Inis Mona
As long as I breathe
I'll call you my home
20 years I have walked your barrows
Years of emulous youth
I followed the path of the wise
There it all was sown
The inspiration
Removing the seven seals
There it was revealed
Enigma of freedom
Unclosing an unseen door
Days are drawing closer
Chariots galloping marching horses
We are legions not of the darkness
We put the evil the in the harness
One of them was stung by our venom
Black lips annexed served the klaxon which
slowly roars
Oh no the damned cant fight us
see arrows 
Looking at the dusty sky
And breaching as we fly
our ships are abandoned
as we fight with our souls
The king has lost his kingdom
countless mightfooled wisdom
in chase of his life
he plays the chess of lies
We were charged for the arson
Burning memories of foul and landlords
Strike the firestorm
Crowley damned and cursed to hell
Gates are open resurrecting martyrs
of flesh and blood skull and bones
covering them with shields and blades
Now they die for glory or be subdued
Holding the axe of war
I fight to defeat the evil one
Only one song that will be means to save the whole world
Till the end of warAcross the plateau no clouds storm the sky
Above the riverbed the world's run dry
I beat the air for those who hear
And through the night my call goes out unheard
I cry for company and get no word
The silent groan God only knows
I stand alone
The wind devides the empty shells below
Deep in the valley night begins to grow
The memory the best of me
From out the shadows something takes my hand
To lead me homeward through a foreign land
The silence grown the palest eyes
I'm the only one
A mother's son a father's pride
How can I run and where to hide
I close my eyes and hope tonight
My healing flesh will be all right
A baby cries another ghost
A different side to claim the most
My blood gone black and down to dust
So save my soul or let me die
I'm still alive
I'm on the other side
Shaken down lovely but cockeyed
No wonder I feel nervous
Lord they don't deserve us anyway
I want to burn these wings
You can see how it's happening
Still they're telling me to smack the enemy
It's killing time
I should have known before
Only bad's half as good as dead
I can't go any faster stuck like alabaster
White as I know
We stand in lines of old staying cold
Swallow all the anger
Releases get away coming down
Across the fields of amber
To the water ocean far below
As the mirror to the sun
The colour of the evening never let go
Hold my stomach keep it tight
They're pulling out the breathing let it go
If you ever change your mind
Don't be caught alone no it's only me
With all the hopes and fears combined
It's hard to care for living anymore
I wouldn't let you down again
Inspired by hunger fired by lust
I sold the children's faces painted gold
Something moving taking hold
Is gathering but never growing old
I did everything I could just to say
Believe me you're not alone
But with the winter in my bones
Oh what else can I do now
It's only me
I wouldn't let you down again
Break back to back lately
Oh and how they moved when I was
younger than this
Get my spirit caught beneath the surface
See me play dead today
I love my daydreams leave my doldrums
Armies of priests
All come to practice their party pieces
Pounding like metal from side to side
To shoot to save
And risk that horizon
No smoke can shield it stays unhealed
Safe in our stillness
At last we see him rise from out the earth
I set the silhouette that leaves me scarred
Lost my condition from the perfect star
I caught the fire can't help but see
There's none to carry on
I knew these plains before the world was mine
With no escape in mind I'll be resigned
Inside alone I know for sure
The future's all gone
When the feeling takes me over what else can I do but run
Through the corridors I follow I shoot into oblivion
If you close your eyes and listen you can hear the children play
I love it when their eyes are watching I'll have it when they disobey
It's a different kind of loving such a dirty rigmarole
But just in case there's no tomorrow I'll dring fire from their souls
If you close your eyes and listen you can hear the children shout
I hate it but I win't be happy till I've turned them inside out
All day long here I go
All day long all day
So the certanty is I can get no air
Getting nowhere at all
Openended and suspended one by one
In the slipstream
And Harvest hold the horrbag
Emotion starts to lag
With panache I keep acrashing
Through the sky
No compassion have I
Kick a kiss of superstition and I cry
Just a guide or I throw
All the panic I can muster
Threatening to the cluster
The hangman's whore so obvious
Discretion's such a drag
But I know his apparatus snows my mind
When it gets too far out
Guard the ribs and fall
I long to catch my breath condemm it all
As the number I become
They count me out a volunteer
See how they run in silence up the belfry steps
Each unaffected by the sight of the blistered skin
Someone to calm me till the pounding in my head stops
Over the tens of thousands find no way out of in
Through the pandemonium My heart is beating like a drum
Barricaded in here crawling's getting creepier
With my head in my hands all the heaven in my heart
Get me out of here let me get away
Let me go from here get me out away
Get me out of here let me get away
Let me out of here let me go today
Helplessly held by the weeds we are grown
I tried talking sense to you leave it alone
I give in to the weight of the kick
So weary of waiting and hoping for this
The two of us alone noone else to see
I promise not to miss you and no more jealousy
Careful of my gender it comes how it goes
Love me tender so nobody knows
Nobody knows the trouble I seen
Each time they asked I said something obscene
The splinters shower down I shelter from the rain
Against the grain against the moon
I waxes and I wanes
No ecstasy sent for taking a line
Right through the stokehold they rip run and shine
I awake and the feeling won't drop
Each time they slam down I swear I will stop
The two of us alone noelse to see
The damage brings us closer to murder can't you see
Here in my rockinghorse house
I keep the curtains drawn
Inside my little head
I hear them screaming out my name
Here in my rockinghorse room
I keep my eyes shut tight
Inside my peepingholes
I know that if they're empty I can sleep
Don't you believe her deliver a shiver to me
Is this what you wanted
I'm haunted my eyes grown cold
I still got second sight
I still can see at night
Here comes the enemy the beast in me
Alive a little more
On my hard shoulder
The warning goes deeper than before
I still got second sight
I still can see at night
She blacks and blues
She wear new bruise
'Cause he beat her senseless
He hit the booze
Whenever she's
Prey to his disease
As she take some beating
Fall to her knees
It's only love he told me so
He's coming home to my bed
I wouldn't bleed if only he'd
leave me along now and then
When did it start
I can't recollect
I'm still alive
if a little wrecked
He makes it so i'm
so old before my time
He comes from behind
it helps him to unwind
It's all right love he told me so
He's promised me no more pain
I wouldn't bleed if only he'd
leave me alone now and then
There goes the siren that warns off the air raid
Then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks
there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Gotta get airborne before it's too late
Running scrambling flying
Rolling turning diving going in again
Run live to fly fly to live do or die
Run live to fly fly to live Aces high
Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over spin round and come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME109's out of the sun
Ascending and turning out spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them I press my guns
Rolling turning diving
Rolling turning diving goin' again
Run live to fly fly to live do or die
Run live to fly fly to live Aces high
Kill for gain or shoot to maim
We don't need a reason
The Golden Goose is on the loose
And never out of season
Blackened pride still burns inside
The shell of bloody treason
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun
For the love of living death
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour the fortune the pain
Go to war again blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for our soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The blind men shout
Let the creatures out
We'll show the unbelievers
Napalm screams of human flames
For a prime time Belsen feast  yeah
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies
The killer's breed or the demon's seed
The glamour the fortune the pain
Go to war again blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for our soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun
The killer's breed or the Demon's seed
The glamour the fortune the pain
Go to war again blood is freedom's stain
Don't you pray for my soul anymore
2 minutes to midnight
The hands that threaten doom
2 minutes to midnight
To kill the unborn in the womb
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
Midnight
Midnight
Midnight
It's all night
As a young boy chasing Dragons
with your wooden sword so mighty
You're St George or you're David and you always
killed the beast
Times change very quickly
And you had to grow up early
A house in smoking ruins and the bodies at your feet
You'll die as you lived
In a flash of the blade
In a corner forgotten by noone
You lived for the touch
For the feel of the steel
One man and his Honour
The smell of resined leather
The steely iron mask
As you cut and thrust and parried at the
fencing master's call
He taught you all he ever knew
To fear no mortal man
And now you'll wreak your vengeance in the
Screams of evil man
He threw down a glove you made the mistake
Of picking it up now you're gone
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords
The choice of weapons is gone
He'll tear you apart as soon as you start
You know you don't have a chance
OHOH Fight for the Honour
Fight for the Splendour
Fight for the Pleasure
OHOH Fight for the Honour
Fight for the Splendour
Fight for your Life
Ready to start the duel begins
the best man wins in the end
A lunge and a feint a parry too late
A cut to the chest and you're down
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain
Feeling the sweat on your brow
The fighting resumes a silence looms the
Swordsman move 'gainst each other
A cut and a thrust a parry a blow
a stab to the heart and you're down
The Angel of Death hears your last breath
Meanwhile the reaper looks on
OHOH Fought for the Honour
Fought for the Splendour
Fought for the Pleasure
OHOH Fought for the Honour
Fought for the Splendour
Fought to the Death
Turn the spotlights on the people
Switch the dial and eat the worm
Take your chances kill the engine
Drop your bombs and let it burn
White flags shot to ribbons
The truce in Black and Burned
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables overturned
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Throwing dice now rolling loaded
I see sixes all the way
In a black hole and I'm spinning
As my wings get shot away
Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
No breaks on the inside
Paper cats and burning barns
There's fox among the chickens
And a killer in the hounds
Questions are a burden
And answers are a prison for oneself
Shellshock in the kitchen
Tables start to burn
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
But still we walk into the valley
And others try to kill the inner flame
We're burning brighter than before
I don't have a number I'M A NAME
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village again
Back in the village again
In the village
I'm back in the village
Back in the village
Back in the village again
Into the Abyss I'll fall  the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night  watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows 
In this Temple
Enter the risen Osiris  risen again
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die I'm a God
Why can't I live on
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
When I was living this lie  Fear was my Game
People would worship and fall 
Drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and
Red wine for the one to succeed me
For he is a man and a God 
And He will die too
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned 
Marbled in stone
A Shell of a man God preserved 
For thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell 
I'll strike from the grave
Tell me why I had to be a Powerslave
I don't wanna die I'm a God
Why can't I live on
When the Life Giver dies
All around is laid waste
And in my last hour
I'm a Slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death
Slave to the Power of Death
Hear the rime of the Ancient Mariner
See his eye as he stops one of three
Mesmerises one of the wedding guests
Stay here and listen to the nightmares
of the Sea
And the music plays on as the bride passes by
Caught by his spell and
the Mariner tells his tale
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice
To a place where nobody's been
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross
Hailed in God's name
hoping good luck it brings
And the ship sails on back to the North
Through the fog and ice and
the albatross follows on
The mariner kills the bird of good omen
His shipmates cry against what he's done
But when the fog clears they justify him
And make themselves a part of the crime
Sailing on and on and North across the sea
Sailing on and on and North 'till all is calm
The albatross begins with its vengeance
A terrible curse a thirst has begun
His shipmates blame bad luck on the Mariner
About his neck the dead bird is hung
And the curse goes on and on and on at sea
And the thirst goes on and on for them and me
Day after day day after day
we stuck nor breath nor motion
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
Water water everywhere and
all the boards did shrink
Water water everywhere nor any drop to drink
There calls the mariner
there comes a ship over the line
But how can she sail with no wind
in her sails and no tide
See onward she comes
Onwards she nears out of the sun
See she has no crew
She has no life wait but there's two
Death and she Life in Death
they throw their dice for the crew
She wins the Mariner and he belongs to her now
Then  crew one by one
They drop down dead two hundred men
She She Life in Death
She lets him live her chosen one
One after one by the star dogged moon
too quick for groan or sigh
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang
and cursed me with his eye
Four times fifty living men
and I heard nor sigh nor groan
With heavy thump a lifeless lump
they dropped down one by one
The curse it lives on in their eyes
The Mariner he wished he'd die
Along with the sea creatures
But they lived on so did he
And by the light of the moon
He prays for their beauty not doom
With heart he blesses them
God's creatures all of them too
Then the spell starts to break
The albatross falls from his neck
Sinks down like lead into the Sea
Then down in falls comes the rain
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen
See them stir and they start to rise
Bodies lifted by good spirits
None of them speak
and they're lifeless in their eyes
And revenge is still sought penance starts again
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on
Now the curse is finally lifted
And the Mariner sights his home
Spirits go from the long dead bodies
Form their own light and
the Mariner's left alone
And then a boat came sailing towards him
It was a joy he could not believe
The Pilot's boat his son and the hermit
Penance of life will fall onto Him
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins
The Mariner's bound to tell of his story
To tell his tale wherever he goes
To teach God's word by his own example
That we must love all things that God made
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man
And the tale goes on and on and onLost in the dark milleniums ago
Where is the place where's the place called home
On fire they rode to flee from the fall
Their future was doomed they've foreseen it all
Mythical world of the ancient empire
secret and hidden but some day we shall return
Ancient calls from anywhere in time
we have to follow the sign
Distant voices  sources unknown
Where to they lead us
Where will we go
On the scent for the lost Coming home
Chasing a shadow in stardust and haze
Where will we find traces of our race
The engines are roaring we're leaving ground once more
is it for real  will we fail like so often before
Ancient calls from somewhere in time
we have to follow the sign
Distant voices  sources unknown
Where to they lead us
Where will we go
On the scent for the lost
Coming home
Mythical world of the ancient empire
is it for real  will we fail like so often before
Ancient calls from somewhere
Star of the old guide us  give us hope
Star
Under the ice
we hide from your stare
buried in grief and despair
We're the debris
the scattered remains
leaves in the storm
who is lashing the world
Destiny calls
extinction of man
will it all happen again
But yet we're alive
unbroken we stand
bannish the conquerer
who's taken the land
We'll be a thorn in your unhuman flesh
there'll be a time for retortion
We'll break the fetters we'll never give in
although it seems our end will begin
Forces united  forces arise
Legions of iron descent from the skies
Dark knight  you'll never defeat
the immortal spirit of freedom
Savior  watch out beware
we will engage
The Forces Of Rage
Starbirds are gliding
on winds of decay
merciless hunting the pray
Infernal machine
the hatchet of war
sharp as a razor
will cut back the claw
We'll be the virus  a deadly disease
the fever is burning inside you
To bring you to fail is the ultimate aim
we'll rise from the ashes again and again
Forces united  forces arise
Legions of iron descent from the skies
Dark knight  you'll never defeat
the immortal spirit of freedom
Savior  watch out beware
we will engage
Free  at least for a moment in time
Years  how many years have gone by
In fury and wharf we're looking above
forging the sword the blade of reprisal
Leaders of man let's ride out again
From fire and ice a blazing star will arise
We'll be a thorn
Forces united  forces arise
Legions of iron descent from the skies
Dark knight  you'll never defeat
the immortal spirit of freedom
Savior  watch out beware
we will engage
The Forces Of Rage
A flash of destruction
like a blaze cut through the night
The heavens on fire
they were glowing in unholy light
Your sudden assault
broke all the dreams of unification
The hunger for power
it's the lash of civilisation
despaired and in pain  all seems so in vain
Fires in the sky
defenceless we stand tonight we will die
Shadows of the end
the Kingdom will fall life it will finally descend
percieve what you've done and repent
Careless we thought
all you do is to bark at the moon
But in the grip of fury
you have conjured
the dawning of doom
is this our fate  wiped out by your hate
Fires in the sky
defenceless we stand tonight we will die
Shadows of the end
the Empire will fall life it will finally descend
Goddess of the seas let us rest in peace
In her cold embrace we will find our graves
Silence will set in  will existance begin  again
Fires in the sky
helpless we stand
defenceless we'll die
Shadows of the end
the Kingdom will fall life will descend
Fires in the sky
helpless we stand defenceless we'll die
Shadows of the end
Atlantis will fall life it will finally descend
descend for evermore
From a fireball we came crossed sea and mountain
We were drinking beauty with our eyes
We were given all to make our own
Let us be left alone
Laid the tasks and paid the price
Everything survives
Crushed and bolted all the grain
After every wind what a stake we're in
It's paying better than the grain
When we talk without amend
We see better men
Deep inside our blood begins to boil
Like a tiger in the cage
Will begin to shake with rageListen life itself
Trying to find an exit
Listen the pace
The pulse grows faster
Beware from beyond
Rises the calm hunter
Death is it you
Death is it you
From far away
You're closing in on me
From the dark world
From the world of shadows
Without any fear
I once chased your being
Back in the time
When I was the hunter
When I was scared
And when I am hiding away
Then you are here
Now I can feel your breath
Somewhere inside
I feel a silent embrace
What do you seek
What gives you the right to condemn
Your cleansing touch I can feel in my soul
Not a warm nor a cold grip around my heart
Good or evil
Lay to waste
I will follow you
Without demanding to know
Where will we go
Good or evil
Is no more
I followed you
Without demanding to know
Where did we go
Relentless command
All have to follow you there
If I am allowed to tell you lies
Only then I will give you my word
If I am allowed to destroy
Only then I will give you my love
An urge for the dark within my shadowland
You are blinding me with all your light
You cannot erase the flaws I have
I can feel the fear you're trying to hide
All my choices they are mine alone
Towards the end I will stand alone
I was born a destroyer
And the waves of heat
Play my role
Time for repent is gone
You're dead to me
You are dead to me
My soul is black as black as the night
Dark demons tear the life out of me
I can't keep fighting searching the path of life
I'll leave you here with a broken heart
Hopes and dreams will fade away
Desperate cries but nothing to say
A thousand reasons to end my stay
Eyes filled with tears falling down no more fears
Sink into oblivion
Depression will guide my path
Obsession brought by the pain
Give me the strength I need
Am I insane
Please let me leave for eternity
Let out my soul please set it free
The essence of me will fade away
The memory as well I certainly can say
Sank into oblivion
Depression guided my paths
Obsession brought by the pain
Gave me the strength I needed
I'm insane
Quick before the night will turn to day
Guide me on my way
I can feel your scent
In solitude you stand
I am following the signs
The eye of light heal me
When all else will wither you will rise
In the dark you will shine
The eye of light
The world that surrounds me has grown dim
The world has become a lonely dark place
Deep in the forest so dark and wild
My Salvation is at hand
If I will find my dear
I will see again the precious light of day
The eye of light heal me
When all else will wither you will rise
In the dark you will shine
The eye of light
Searching in the dark
Where are you my love
When I'm one with the black
Slowly I can feel your scent
A glimpse of light
In the dark I can see your shine
The eye of light heal me
When all else will wither you will rise
In the dark you will shine
The eye of light
Decay of grey in a world of dust
Breathe in taste the ancient air
Softly touch the memories
Thousands of small fragments
In my ancient eyes you can see me dream
Endlessly dreams is all I have
Breathe out inside my coffin
Lonely still remembering
My unattended funeral
I was the last of my kind
I was born a believer
Never to follow a leader
I was born to bleed
Never allowed to be healed
All of you mindless fools
Watching from beneath the surface
Distorted visions from underneath
How come why couldn't you see
All I ever wanted is for you to see clear
I was born a believer
Never to follow a leader
I was born to bleed
Never allowed to be healed
In my ancient eyes you can see me dream
Endlessly dreams is all I have
Deep breaths fills your lungs
Liquid will finally open your minds
And clear your thoughts
It's too late lost forevermore
I was the last of my kind
I'm hiding away from all in a coat of dark
With a darkness so thick and dense only sorrow reach through
The surrounding world seems so distant for me
So close but yet so far away
In silence alone  my tears flow free
Alone in silence  my scars are deep
Feel a chill run down my neck
Feel the fear from within
Screams from silence in the dark
As it swallows me from inside
I can't see the bright white light at the tunnel's dark end
Through the dark I will go tonight until the end of time
I take off my oh so heavy coat I want to feel free
Please set me free from eternity
In silence alone  my tears flow free
Alone in silence  my scars are deep
I hear a cry a distant cry
Closing in from the dark
I can feel yes I can feel
A lonely cry from the inside
The power within words
Is hard to comprehend
Wiped all beauty away
All we use to have
Only words
Till the end of time
Only words
I wish to erase
Only words
For eternity
Only words
One single night
Only words
I wish to erase
Only words
My regret
The words that killed
All the memories
We once shared
Now they are dead
Only words
For eternity
One single night
I wish to erase
My regretFaster than speed of light time is cash time is ripe
For everything we want to be for everything we long to see
Come on come on where do you go Don't look back we need to grow
If you want yourself to thrive just stay twentyfive
Don't get used to the old there's too many to be sold
No time to dwell time to rest we rape time at its best
This crazy highway we call life is just the biggest alibi
To overtake to steal to fool to rape time
Cannot win can't live with it need something to handle it
Just come on give me a hug slip me anabolic drugs
A needle for my way to mars by doping I could reach the stars
Lame excuses show a bit everyone is doing it
Like there was no tomorrow
Don't you cry my friend you cannot hide again
You live to serve my need and will
Take this open door walk on this famous floor
Where many men have failed before
Expelled from heaven I'm king of lost souls never rising
Expelled from heaven I'm king of lost souls never dying
Soon as you're born you're becoming a diamond
And I am waiting to perfect this stone
Rely on proficiency I will make your world
As you want it all needs reduced to the max
Vanity wallow in luxury indifference my favorite sins
If you choose to be on the loose you'll see
Nothing but the whole of me
Expelled from heaven I'm king of lost souls
Expelled from heaven I'm king
Hey are you ready for the show
For all the things you gotta know
For a life of rock' n roll
Hello hello is there anybody out there Hear my call
Hello you look at me and catch nothing at all
Hello it hurts but I've got nothing to return
Hello I sense everything but you don't seem to
I'm just longing for the dark I need a way to disembark
From this ship of endless nightmares
I'm dead yet awake I'm a catatonic schizophrenic
This is worse than death I'm a catatonic schizophrenic
Soothe your will to live I'm a catatonic schizophrenic
Turn of the instruments end my catatonic sleep
Hello hello attacks of madness constantly increase 
Hello you try to hide your pity but I see
Hello see my eyes they show you how I feel
Hello I feel everything but noone seems to
Long ago you felt so isolated
Question like where do I belong
You've tried to take off all idols
Worse than bad alas
There's a lack selfconfidence
In the air about to suffocate
If selfesteem would stink
You were a perfect fragrance
You've got to make it you've got to change it
You've got to learn it You've got to
Raise hands to the sky see the bad times passing by
Raise hands to the sky escape your shadow
Raise hands to the sky make up your mind leave it all behind
Raise hands to the sky escape your shadow
Here you are in life of mysteries
Stranding on the gates yo yourself
Sympathy you're longing for
Means dare to face the real you
Will you go and fight the watchmen of your mind
Would you do anything to fight what makes you blind
Shades of butterflies
A touch of unsettled lies
Invincible mountains left behind
What else can we do
How can we resume
Luck in which we almost drowned
Could we start again
Really start again
I would be there yes I really would
Turn back there for good
Come let us try to find again
What we've lost so far
A dash of jealousy
Too much love for free
Ready was the dish of rage
Truth and honesty
Should be certainty
But we really trampled on
Would a black man let you hunger
Would a muslim even plunder
Would all indians kill my trees
Would polar bears make my land smaller
Would a child mortcage my future
Would a lake refuse my right to breathe
If we exchanged the roles and turned the whole
What if we cared
What if we were prepared
Wouldn't al the pain vanish into thin air
What if we strained We could part from every chain
Would a paradise be a guide of life
Would a fish go angling mankind
Would spider tread us down
Would a coral bank drill for oil
Would a whale eat you for sex drive
Would a pig fatten you
Would elephants and tigers cage you up
A careful walk on broken crystal alibis I dodge a rage she scatter round
A face that hides any kind any sign any traits of weakness
Words break out from deep within showing me again the reality
Of what we have where we stand that we don't comprehend
Together yet alone a wall inside our home
Together we have built it filled it just as we dig deep
To bury unsaid in ourselves a hiding place
To treasure up the hurt the pain but
Let it out let it out free it from the underground
Break her heart take her heart think about a brand new start
Deify deify a rest of hope I can deny
Look at you look at me  Stop stop
Time is running out you reach for life without the light of self control
Time is running out wake up my friend and feel again what's really there
Scars now visible but who is responsible Is it invertible
Can we take back suffering pain the wounds the hurt
We fall into the great oblivion we've unlearned to carry on
We blame it on the me the you the us the we the lust
A remaining peace of trust somewhere in the dust
Unjustly covered by confusion that led us astray
Here at my wailing wall I hope you hear my call
Help us to break the surface Repeat
Here at my wailing wall I hope you hear my call stop the fall
Let it out let it out
Free it from the underground
Think about think about stop it stop it
I don't want to let you go
Don't want to feel the fear when you're not here
If only I could turn back time
I would have taught you even more
Child don't try to grow so fast
Walk slowly through your life Evoke the pats
Willful traps are lurking everywhere
Don't blunder into there be aware
Look at what we've left behind
And get a sense for turning wrong things right
The burden you take on is your fate
Get rid of the hate that poisons minds
I apologize
In a world of violent hearts
Time is running fast
War for breakfast minds are restless
becoming what we are
Dealing with hunger we're all sons of plunder
Feeding the needs on the poor
Climate changes rearrange
A basic thought of earth
Halhearted acting vanity's attracting
But we slowly realize
We're lost in time and space we're wandering we can't be king
We're lost we take all pills we are pretenders of good will
We've lost a way out to humanity and honesty we're lost
Ice is melting water is pelting
Down on poor man's land
I buy you you by me
Digital money seems to rule the world
Declarations of war far from any law
Feed the hate among the beasts
We are sending out our poison to the clouds
While nature's crying out loud
Since was born into this world
I've been longing to take my place
But every chair that I reached seemed engaged
Everyone said I shouldn't be there
If life was a movie and I were the headliner
Would the audience celebrate me
This is one question of thousands and millions
That has been torturing me
I'm digging down down digging down down
Close to the abyss I fall back into habits
In a nutshell  It breaks my fall
Didn't want to hear clever advice
Always thought mine was the best of all
Tried to prove black is white changed the day into night
Hurt without noticing it
In the end of it all remains nothing at all
But loneliness and infinite fall
I'm digging down down digging down down
But when you feel the love is there
You're overwhelmed your hearts aware
These are the days of peaceful life
These are the moments of delight
Over the day my shadow are haunting me
Afraid of the whole world around
Hard on the surface but weakness there under
Flavored with fear to the core
Propel this solitary man in front of us with his corrupted global agenda muttering into his ears
Corporate money stuffed into his pockets to spread his darkened gospel
In the past the crowned once held the covenant to shape and develop a better world
Their influence and supremacy built by generating optimistic and confident perception offerings to their herds of sheep
Time repeats itself and outspoken pledges continue to not succeed the people have renounced trust in ideologies
Safety and protection is the contemporary vow for the role that will reinstall masterdom and control
To rescue us from uncertainty and peril that we are visionless to see or interpret
A threat that evidently needs to be fought in a manufactured waged war
A vile misconception that has unfurled unquestioned while being exaggerated and disfigured
Summon the servants that are chained at the throat by a tarnished chain only devoted to their prosperous fathers
A grip so tight it bruises the neck when the beast exhales the horror's that settle internally
Galloping toward immoral intent with the set bounties on the heads of the righteous
The dismantled bodies given back for validation and gratuity to amuse the gods of fortune
The itching appetite grows as these hounds unearth the leaders and thieve on the lives of the weak beneath them
Aggravation dissolves into a joyous laughter as the oppressors loan vows to benefit the wealthy
And cast down the frail hero by hero slaughtered in vain assassinations of demigods in secrecy
A never ending pattern to cast down the frail and throne the elite
Taken by the benumbed hands of an overthrowing fabricated God
Sadism is fashioned to derive pleasurable and gratifying entertainment among indoctrinated soldiers
Sexually abusive torture is diminished to mere wretched amusement
Ordered to fragment the sanity of prisoners of an artificial war amidst a country of dystopia
The blameless are left in complete shackled isolation left to linger and ultimately wither and rot
Fraudulent peacemakers withdraw any sense of morality to plant the seeds of their own sadistic conceptions
This fabricated God reduces man to nothing more than a pile of waste
With this power he banishes his followers and sentences them to his own personal sins
He masturbates on the scriptures that hold his kingdom together as one and lays it to shame
Taken by the benumbed hands of an overthrowing fabricated God
Sadism is fashioned to derive pleasurable and gratifying entertainment among indoctrinated soldiers
Sexually abusive torture is diminished to mere wretched amusement
Ordered to fragment the sanity of prisoners of an artificial war amidst a country of dystopia
With this power he banishes his followers and sentences them to his own personal sins
He masturbates on the scriptures that hold his kingdom together as one and lays it to shame
This fabricated God reduces man to nothing more than a pile of waste
Falsehood projects from a daytoday instrumental broadcast that flows through the net of mass media
The lungs swell as the puppets speak to the public as their words grow limbs to crawl and give birth to ignorance
Reports endlessly drift and clock reality leaving mass audiences to believe into layers of fiction
The hellish elite pull the vulnerable strings of journalism with the mastery of everyday blood money and ultimatums
The boundless flavor of dominance on the starved tongue gives these kings a mental state of ambitious arousal
For corruption steadily trickles from their fingertips and showers into the pool of forged mental assurance at their feet
The sleeping masses live on in their so called tranquil lifestyle they sleep and wake utterly
Blindfolded in a regurgitated fashion money will always equal dominance above law and above
Government disinformation will constantly leave a nation as a forever
Sleeping giant due to the ongoing voice of propaganda
Epidemic once again uncovers its malignant crown in one instantaneous instant
A man made formula hatches out of its shell to inch closer to suppress the living and breathing
The newborn are nurtured in a world of a dishonest master design
A layout constructed only for the purpose of dominance authority and power
Born as slaves into bondage born into a prison that they can't distinguish with smell or touch
In a world that's been fallaciously influenced for decades
Where the ones who offer solution are secretively the core of this ongoing problem
Architects of control build their herds of municipal infantry with inventions of fear and panic
We all march quietly with open hands into global enslavement
Drown us submerge our bodies in the ocean of manipulation
This nation is forcefully shackled to the fatigued earth it endeavors standing on
Ruled and overthrown by tyranny and dictatorship weakening it at its delicate knees
Liberation is a fabricated expression only uttered by the propagandized swarm of illogical followers
Men woman and children all blindfolded and mislead to believe in a world of utter persuasion
Striking terror in the eyes of the ignorant with public displays of manslaughter and execution grounds
To butcher the enlightened for what purpose Because starvation for power mushrooms upward leaving leaders foaming
Across their malnourished gaping jaws Striking their iron hammers to fuck over the breathing bodies slaving
To conform to a lie build the gates to close the doorway from truth slam the doors on reality
The blameless are succumbing to the ravages of warfare built upon capital and greed
The lords of corruption leave their people to rot in the goreriddened streets of chaos
Education employment and health all stolen from the hands that deteriorate at the flesh
The slaving clench their fists pleading and praying for a redesigned future as they reach the brink of renouncement
Dreading to open the mouth and spill the words of loathing for with this tongue will only bring execution
Hundreds upon thousands all damned at the dawning of life all damned at the opening day of birth
The manufactured gods detach these withered bodies and sell the
Land to the highest bidder of the corporate elite
With death comes revenue piles of profit and wealth all generated in blood
It began under the dictatorship of a dark lord with the mindset of world supremacy set in years past
Our nation picked up the pieces of a slain giant and continued to shape a psychological immorality
Mind control on mass scale in post war endeavors a shameful instrument once used to take over the deteriorating world
Unspeakable experiments cast on the on the blameless with no justification or rational reasoning
Deprivation of food withering the helpless into fading cadaverous bodies corroding at the mouth
Forced sleeplessness causing the brain to malfunction and shut down leaving the patients to fall into mental illness
Immense shock treatment and drug intake injected at the vein to degrade the human body and its weakening organs
Blackening all luminescence to puzzle the mind to create dread of the time that lay ahead
A discharged invasion of the mind a program now Americanized
The bodies of millions pile atop the splintered streets of a now rotting metropolis
Ignorantly drowning in the flames and fumes fabricated by their own doing
As their lives smolder and ignite their faces steadily ripen with immense pleasure
Selfexecution comes with victory selfmutilation comes with utter success
Their perception flickers within the glowing and ignited landscape as they gaze toward the once populated soil
The nations flag cloaks the impure fallen militant bodies fraudulent celebration of integrity
The hordes of the serpentine lord infantry march and butcher the remaining living
Nuclear warfare ticks down as the sirens resonate through the ears of the moribund
Detonation Extermination The fragmented shell diffuses and erupts
A conflagration of infernal horror
The earth slowly rots into a malignant tumor
Breeding no life for the future of the world
In wake of a nuclear war bodies rise from the fractured and decomposing fields of abandonment
Their bodies and faces mutated and disfigured
Still breathing through their brimful lungs
They limp and crawl across the ruins they once claimed on a leisurely ongoing march
Their flesh still burns the skin blackens
And embers into the dimming airWhite bolts of lightning
Came out of nowhere
Blinded the darkness
Creating the storm
War in the heavens
Vengeance ignited
Torment and tempest
Attacks like a swarm
Forged out of flame from chaos to destiny
Bringer of pain forever undying
Judas is Rising
Eternal betrayer
Ice cold and evil
Taking no prisoners
Dark prince of the world
Humanity trembles
Enslaving you sinners
You can't beg for mercy
For none will be saved
The burden of shame
Echos the prophecy
Ascending from Hell
Forever despising
Judas is Rising
Apprentice revealed
Deceivers are crying
My crucified steel
Evangelizing
Judas is Rising
Judas is Rising
Forged in the black country
Under blood red skies
We all had our dream to realise
Driving in that transit
Down to holy Joe's
Used to lose our head
While metal flowed
Nothing held us back or dared to try
Something in our blood
Won't let us die
We built our world of metal
Watched it grow
Fuelled the fury solid to the bone
Gotta deal with the devil
'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel
Rollin' down the mway
Took it to the smoke
Bangin' heads there
'til we all went broke
When we don the leather and the whips and chains
Nothing matters more
We can't be tamed
Fighting through the din and accolades
Turn the phase around with razor blades
Watched the movement grow
Into one voice
Took on all the world
It had no choice
Gotta deal with the devil
'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel
We hit at night
You're in our sight
Then we can feel
What we've been waiting for
Let me hear you roar
Upon this stage
We let it rage
And for a time we leave the world behind
To be with our own kind
Gotta deal with the devil
'cause you know that it's real
Done a deal with the devil
From a heart made of steel
If you think it's over
Better think again
There'll be no compromise
Turning up the power
Feel adrenaline
Move into overdrive
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
If you think I'd back down
Or accept defeat
Brace for the aftershock
Driven to the limit
Take it to the streets
Give it everything you've got
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
Time to come together
Revolution
Living on forever
Revolution
Get ready for the evolution
Here comes the revolution
Time for retribution
You said I could never find a way to ease your mind
That where I'd go you'd wind up in the dust
I tried so hard to have you reach another side of me
Instead you went to nowhere and forgot
So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Desert heat can wear you down
But still I'm rollin' through
Did I see your figure in the haze
I am driven by a thirst to quench myself of love
The sun beats on me for the price I've paid
So I wander on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Yeah
Night road leads me to a town of ghosts
Beckoned by the glow of keresone  tumbleweed
They're calling out they're calling out
Forever more forever more
I'm leaning in the wind
Head bowed down from what I saw
My shadow for a friend
Still some things are worth fighting for
So I'm moving on
Asking where you might have gone
From what I knew before
Some things are worth fighting for
Yeah
Worth fighting for
Born of the sun
Crashed to the earth
Tormented reviled
Engorged hate from birth
Hellions the steed
Bloods on the wing
Claws set to slice
Vengeance he'll bring
Cremating the land
In seek and destroy
Apocalypse slays
Napalm he'll deploy
The beast of a god
Regalled of his race
Prepared to onslaught
And bare face to face
Across the divide
The thresholds in flames
The painkiller rises again
The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to possess us
Out demons out
Blade of the wheel
Cuts deep in the bone
It's gideons quest
To take Satan's throne
The critical mass
And power that they wield
Exterminate all when vermin rebel
A maelstrom begins
To disintegrate
And pulverise all in its' wake
The scream of the demon
There's evil about
They've come to possess us
Out demons out
Born on the other side
Of the track
Gotta get outta here
I won't look back
Born on the other side
Wild as a hurricane
Living in overdrive
Wheels of fire
In my soul
Wheels of fire
Wheels of fire
Let 'em roll
Too fast to give a damn
Stand my ground
No one or anything
To tie me down
Born on the other side
Wild as a hurricane
Living in overdrive
Wheels of fire
In my soul
Wheels of fire
Wheels of fire
Let 'em roll
Ride to live
Live to ride
Wheels of fire forever
Angel  put sad wings around me now
Protect me from this world of sin
So that we can rise again
Oh angel  we can find our way somehow
Escaping from the world we're in
To a place where we began
And I know we'll find
A better place and peace of mind
Just tell me that it's all you want  for you and me
Angel won't you set me free
Angel remember how we'd chase the sun
Then reaching for the stars at night
As our lives had just begun
When I close my eyes I hear your velvet wings and cry
I'm waiting here with open arms  oh can't you see
Angel shine your light on me
Oh angel we'll meet once more  I'll pray
When all my sins are washed away
Hold me inside your wings and stay
Oh angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
Angel take me far away
Put sad wings around me now
So that we can rise again
Here they come
These gods of steel
Megatron
Devouring what's concealed
Speed of death
Crossfired they stare
Final breath
From vaporizing glares
Raised to man oppressed
Sign of persecution
Hellrider
Roars on through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight
All incensed to overthrow
Strong defence
With armaments they grow
By this quest
Their fates renowned
Put to rest
Abominations crown
Time to ram it down
Judgement for the tyrant
Hellrider
Roars through the night
Hellrider
Raised for the fight
Fight undying and eternal
Wheels bring death and
Pain infernal
Honour bound in strength repleated
To no end they're undefeated
Hellrider hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider hellrider
You bought them through their despair
Hellrider hellrider
Your tempered steel relinquished
Hellrider hellrider
You slaught them all extinguished
Wrath of doom
In killing fields
They consume
For valiants never yield
Triumph to the gods
Vanquished of enslavers
Hellrider
Breaking their will
Hellrider
In for the kill
Hellrider hellrider
You fought their battle for them
Hellrider hellrider
You brought them through it all
Hellrider
And so now it comes to pass
By the eventide on mass
See them gather yet alas
They remain still as stained class
For they know only too well
That the story they will tell
Conjures up an ageless spell
Guarded by the sentinel
So it goes forevermore
Ever steady to the core
That the sign that they came for
Waves majestic from the floor
Grey mist drifts upon the water
The mirrored surface moves
Awakened of this presence
Dispelling legends proof
A beastly head of onyx
With eyes set coals of fire
It's leathered hide
Glides glistening
Ascends the heathered briar
This legend lives
Through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternities on and on and on
Lochness confess your terror of the deep
Lochness distress
Malingers what you keep
Lochness protects monstrosity
Lochness confess to me
Somehow it heeds the piper
From battlements that call
From side to side it ponders
Impassioned in the skirl
This highland lair of mystery
Retains a lost world's empathy
Resiliant to discovery on and on and on
This legend lives
Through centuries
Evoking history's memories
Prevailing in eternity
Your secret lies safe with me
This creatures peril from decease
Implores to mankind for release
A legacy to rest in peace and on and on and onLeaving the club 8 beers swallowed 
Staggering straight to your car 
Don't waste no thought on your recklessness 
Knowing your home is not far 
Starting the engine shift to first gear 
Invulnerable you are 
Gaining speed with every second 
You are the highway star 
Run  faster 
Taking the corner devilstyle 
Finally risking it all 
Tires are losing the grip on wet leaf 
Clenching the wheel as you skid 
The engine's roaring one last time 
You're watching the tree coming near 
Never been afraid of dying 
Pain is your only fear 
As the blood runs 
Out of your countless wounds 
You realize you'll die 
Live fast 
Die young 
You just got 2 minutes to live 
Cut off leg broken arms 
Trapped in your wrecked pile of steel 
Percieving that you are unable to move 
Pinned behind the wheel 
Still conscious massive pain 
Watching your live passing by 
Even if help comes it will be too late 
Make yourself ready to die
Dwelling on memories 
Drowning in sorrow bothering you 
From inside they're crawling 
The Anger you can't hide 
Palefaced mindclones 
Imprisoned dignity 
Infected sanity 
Rotten egos 
Rotten to the core 
Cold isolation 
The last resort that keeps you breathing 
Just guided by instincts 
Aware of cunning penetration 
No one's servant 
Solid dignity 
Healed insanity
Welcome to a beautiful nightmare 
You can't escape 'cause it's reality 
Marching through a wasted land 
Dead bodies pave the way you walk 
Seeking the unknown 
Once again you kill the nameless one 
Waiting for the next command 
Just another bloody massacre 
I once was your victim 
You splattered my brain 
With violent oppression 
I now will return 
Back from the grave 
Live undead 
Evil reborn 
Live undead 
Meet me in a moonless night 
I suck your blood and eat your entrails 
Feasting on your lifeless corpse 
I gnaw the meat off the god damn bones 
Though it may seem a little late 
I enjoy the bitter sweet taste 
Of dissipated revenge
Another usual day in your life 
There you sit and wait to finish work 
Imaginations of subhuman kind 
But no one sees through you and your secret within 
As you knock on the door 
Your blood starts to boil 
Enjoy the pain you want more 
And you will never recoil 
Bow down now 
Obey 
Show obsequiousness 
Remote controlled you stalk through the streets 
As you know your aim and your aim is the pain 
Bondage gear and the lady in black 
And when you feel the whip it's like heaven on earth 
As you knock on the door 
Your blood starts to boil 
Enjoy the pain you want more 
And you will never recoil 
Bow down now 
Obey 
Show obsequiousness
Don't move 
Lucky You won You survived
Suddenly I found myself 
Running out of lies running out of excuses 
Here I stand no apologies 
What else can I give 
To cover the betrayal 
That's the living in me 
Suddenly the truth is staring 
At my face your face his face 
Can't go on with this shit 
Running out of time 
Got no time to lose 
Here I'm standing got no ideas 
The truth they say will never come 
Here I'm standing got no stories 
The fairy tale has just begun 
I leave you now with another lie 
As I always pretend I am here 
Right back to where it all began 
Another circle ends 
Another broken heart
I found myself today 
Trapped in this bed 
My hands tied feet tied 
A hole in my head 
Nothing left inside my brain 
I don't even know my name 
I feel I see I smell 
This is my living hell 
What did I do why am I here 
No answers 
What would you do 
When all you knew is dead and gone 
You look around 
What you see makes no sense 
Feeling strange 
You realize you had a total blackout 
I am still lying on this plank bed here 
My inner self filled up with fear 
A spark of memories 
Becomes a flame 
A syringe needle in my vein 
Three tubes  liquid  that hose 
The end seems very close 
I woke up for my own execution 
I can't believe that 
I will soon be dead and gone 
The drugs work make me weak 
Make me dead 
Feeling tired 
I realize I'll have a total blackout
My life is changing so fast I can't explain 
I know what it's all about nothing seems the same 
A look at my past life than drying all my tears 
Passing the gate this is the hour of our fears 
Waiting my whole life why should I take care 
No one is waiting do I have to be there  
Leaders of our time just standing behind 
Fighting a war I can't ignore 
Future oppressions 
Forgotten displaced designed from a thought 
Now my last hope I'm praying to god 
What is behind this imaginary wall  
What is behind it  I don't know at all 
Future oppressions becoming more clear 
This is a warning so you must take heed 
Watching and waiting how deep I descend 
Is there deliverance in the end
Don't move 
You're dead
Thursday morning 6 am 
Waiting for the only train 
For my girl a kissgoodbye 
Tell her there`s no need to cry 
Get off the train into the plane 
Flying to the sun 
Hot like hell great hotel 
Longing for some fun 
Primal mission poolbarcheck 
Alcohol shall break the neck 
Both barmen look like suckers 
Just one word motherfuckers 
Madness surrounds 
hitting the town 
Just some tourist stores 
Back to the hotel 
a few more drinks 
Next days will bring more 
Poolbar drinks for free 
Sunna macht mi hie 
Morning fart shall blow 
Ritual in Rhodes 
Wake up with the morning shine 
Just to miss the breakfast time 
Sandwiches and coffee white 
All inclusive  that`s alright 
Down on the beach 
sun is unleashed 
Skin is turning red 
Back to the poolbar a lot of drinks 
Make us sleep like dead 
Poolbar free drinks kick 
Sun just makes me sick 
Morning fart still blows 
Ritual in Rhodes 
Rent some Harleys hit the road 
Cruising all along the coast 
Sun is burning from above 
All that`s left is one red scarf 
Centercourt calls just some old balls 
Afternoon sun on our skin 
Jump in the pool 
swim around the bar 
Having a few more drinks 
Poolbarkeepers suck 
Never playing rock 
Hate inside us grows 
Ritual in Rhodes 
Disco overdose 
Ritual in Rhodes 
Morning fart still blows 
Ritual in Rhodes
Get up at the usual time 
Packed bag in the corner of the room 
Breakfast  the day`s starting well 
Rushing in by the ringing of the bell 
Now my time has come 
And my job has to be done 
Don`t move it won`t help you anyway 
Get ready for my judgement day 
Highschool death 
Bullets flying through the classroom 
Ripping virginal flesh from the bone 
Blood spills from the teacher`s head 
He tortured me and now he`s dead 
Outside the parents cry 
Cops are waiting to come in 
Kids are screaming trying to run away 
This is my private judgement day 
Highschool death
I O'Brian of the Black Horsemen forbid this sacrilege
You all know that this Demon Child has Abigail's spirit 
Inside
But what you don't know is
That she is the reincarnation of my stillborn halfsister
Her spirit is not EVIL nor is it GOOD
All it wants is to make things right again
So spare this life through which revenge can be mine
And Abigail can find her final peace
I O'Brian have spoken
Let it be done
18 was yesterday today she was
A woman in every single way
Abigail was wathing in the forest where
The darkness it seems to be alive
It was hours ago that she left her home
The chapel in which Black Horsemen saved and raised her soul
And now in the darkest night a storm was born
And Abigail she did not know she was its prey
In the storm itself a monster came alive
Chasing Abigail lightning from the sky
Ah then her face turned white
Never did she see the EYE that cried
Raindrops on her head weeping for the dead rain rain rain
Turning red
Oh no  Let me go back to my home  Oh no  Oh
God he looked away the night the storm it came
And Abigail was drawn into the rain
Rain was pulling on her hair
To where there is a mansion THE LAIR
Lurking in the dark when lightning struck again
The mansion showed itself in silhouette
Ah rusty iron gates
This is where the Little One she waits
Raindrops on her head weeping for the dead rain rain rain
Turning red
Oh no  Let me go back to my home  Oh no  Oh
Seeing the little one knowing that she was a ghost
Abigail wondering why she was
Mummified a lantern in her hand
And in the light she saw a name Cound de La Fey
Mansion in Sorrow mansion in the dark
Maybe tomorrow the Devil's mark
The gates were locked from the inside
And Abigail was sure to die
Then Little One went straight through her body
And the gates they opened wide
And Little One went up the stairs to the old oak door
Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark
Maybe tomorrow the Devil's mark
Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark
Maybe tomorrow the Devil's mark
Lightning was striking the trees all around
Abigail still in shock awoken by the sound
Run better run run better run after Little One
Run better run run after Little One
But Little One had gone gone to the beyond
Mansion in sorrow mansion in the dark
Suddenly the door was open Where have you been my dear
I'm Brandon Henry and I serve the master here
Through a maze of gloomy hallways and candles black
Safe from the storm she followed the man with the shaved head
They went in in to a room that was like a shrine
Jewelry and dresses too in cabinets made of glass
Portraits on the walls 18 in all
A strong scent of old perfume and then there was THE HAIR
Long black lifeless hair
Curtains of back were inside the room
Shutting out the light the light that always hurt his eyes
There was nothing bright in this entire mansion no no
Except for the candlelight the light and the fire that burned real slow
Oh Miriam why did you have to go and die
Curtains of black were inside the room
Abigail was not alone there was someone else in here too
Come closer dear said the shadow in the wheelchair
Stand by the fireplace so I can better see your face
Oh Miriam why did you have to go and die
The shadow could not believe the likeness in her face
It looked as if his Miriam had come back from the grave
I am Count de La Fey and you are
Abigail she whispered and shivered to the bone
Can I he said Can I can I call you Miriam
Miriam or Abigail is fine
You can even call me Lucy for it is just a name
He struggled out of the wheelchair
Since his fall many years ago
Now he could only walk by a cane what a shame
Don't move Stay where you are and then he was right behind her
Touching her long black hair he was breathing much harder now
Then he grabbed her head
In the pain she screamed as he
Yanked out a lock of that beautiful hair oh dear oh dear oh dear
He quickly struggled across the floor to a smaller cabinet
Behind glass door it said To My beloved Dear
It was then he started to compare and she saw the other HAIR
In his twisted mind she was back but why
I must retire my dear in order to prepare
You should do the same tomorrow an heir
Mommy mommy mommy mommy
Later that Night in her RoomAbigail was drifting off to sleep
All of what she had seen Today was hard to believe
Then the screams of a child in pain creeping deep into her brain
Then the screams of a child in pain she cannot find her mommy
And that's a shame
Abigail was quickly on her feet
Down the stairs and into the dark Abigail was following the sound
And there she was THE CHILD
It was clearly a ghost the ghost from the gate in the storm
Little girl tell me who you are
I am your spirit twin from years ago I'm LITTLE ONE
That brought back memories of Abigail when turning six
Sneaking out of bed like she always did
Hiding in the dark listening to the men
Tell their stories from way back then
She remembered the story of Jonathan
And they'd been talking about the Little One
Then the screams of a child in pain creeping deep into her brain
Then the screams of a child in pain she cannot find her mommy
And that's a shame
Abigail she knew she had to stay
Saving Little One and breaking the chain breaking the chain
Wake up Abigail midday Henry was at her door
The Count would not rise 'til the afternoon and lunch was for two
So they talked about Miriam and then Abigail said
What about Little One
Henry froze Oh you mean our ghost
Downstairs on the lowest floor
That's where you will find THE DOOR
Beyond which there ware slippery stairs
Leading down to the crypt
And Little One sleeps there during the day
But at night she'll rise searching for her Mom
Don't you ever go there at night it's a sinister place
There's so much pain so much death so much nothingness
When night time came on the second day and dinner it was done
Jonathan's headache it was gone
Miriam please take my hand then his mood really changed
Time is right to produce an heir
Playing along with his eerie game she followed him up the stairs
Up to a room where love they would share
To a room that smelled as if Miriam was still in there
Jonathan was a hideous sight
So Abigail she hilled the candlelight
What was to come should have never been done
She was blocking her mind from his awful thing
In her mind his moaning became
Nothing but falling on slippery stairs
Falling and crying crawling and dying
At the end of the stairs
Her eyes turned black in disgust
Hating him more with every thrust
And then it was over before it begun
He was done oh what a man
The only time he would call her MINE
The moon is outside but it can't get in
Almost dead from his nightly sin
Jonathan is deep asleep a perfect time to visit the heep
Down the halllway to the lair down down the slippery stairs
Abigail is in the crypt a lantern in her hand
The secret of the crypt
A coffing made for a child wondering who is inside
Oh Abigail and off comes the lid
The smell is sick
Mummified infront on its side
A name was cut deep in the lid with a knife
And it said Abigail
A silvery necklace was round the mummy's neck
It had wings and was sharpened round the edge
What are you doing here Henry had come in unseen
Abigail pulled on the necklace and the little mummy's head
Was separated clean from it's tiny neck
Then up up up up into his throat
Twisting and turning it oh she couldn't stop
Brandon Henry was going down in a pool of blood
He was on the ground
There's an eerie glow in the crypt down below
Mummified infant on its side
Gotta go gotta run I'll be back for you Little One
In the crypt Abigail's twin is searching for a home
Abigail's twin is searching for her Mom
But Mommy's in the floor and it's made of stone
Her mommy's in the floor and she doesn't know
Oh she doesn't know she doesn't know
Will she ever know
The storm was gone but dark clouds still hung around
The perfect setting for things to come late afternoon
She was still in bed after her visit to the crypt
Someone was calling Henry's name
Or was it only in her dream
A dream of breaking glass glass cutting into flesh
Rain turning red blood running for the dead
Again she heard a name it was louder but the same
Jonathan was fighting his way out of bed
 Where is Brandon Henry and why is he late
 He didn't feel very well today
So I sent him back to bed and there he'll stay
But I my dear will cater to your needs
For you I will be the hand the hand that feeds
Abigail obsessed with her revenge
Her old spirit was back
It made her remember her dream of broken glass
Use it in your scheme the broken glass
Broken glass crushed into sugar glace
Making dinner for Jonathan Abigail was having fun
Would it be romantic dinner or slaughter of the lamb
Would broken glass be cutting deep deep into the flesh of a man
Dinner was enjoyed by candlelight
And Jonathan was wearing his
Funeral suit it put him in the right mood
Whatever it took he would do
He was in love he was in love again
He was in love he was in love again
But Abigail would soon feed his love away
Feed his love away
Dinner is served
In the dark she was so beautiful and white
Abigail was glowing like a diamond in the night
 I love you Miriam
Oh my God my stomach
 That hurts there it is again oh what pain
It's like someone's cutting me with a knife
This is more than pain
 Ah ha ha I put broken glass in your dinner dear
It's only getting worse from here
Time has come to say hello to fear
No more hiding from the sun count the minutes as they run
Run away with life itself
 What's wrong with you Miriam
I'm hurting please help me
 Ah ha ha NO NO you're gonna die
This is so much more than pain feel the Devil's rain
No more hiding from the sun count the minutes as they run
Run away with life itself
 I can't believe you're doing this to me
My God I'm bleeding through my mouth
What was that Oh No
 What you did to my mother trying to kill me inside of her
Miriam she died alright but I'm still alive
I was the sister of your father's in another life
The father you never knew who saved me years ago
And now I'm looking at his son
A man and his wheelchair living in the past
No room for life only the dark
I was so close to the end I will never forget the coffin and nails
But little Abigail is back again
So young and beautiful while you are living in the past
A past so dark there is no room for life itself
And all I see when I'm looking at you
Is where EVIL always LIVED and ruled
You almost killed me and now you must pay
A man and his wheelchair living in the past
No room for life only the dark
Do you even know who the Hell it is
You are keeping in the crypt Do you
Fear and twisted hate then the feeling of being betrayed
Overwhelmed him
 That child is part of ME
He had to get up get up and out of the wheelchair
But without his cane Oh he didn't stand a chance
The cane was in her hand she used it to push him back
Push him in the chest she was ready for attack
Then a quick blow to his wrist four five across his back
One last one hit him in the neck
 I can't believe you're still alive
My God she screamed I'll teach you how to die
This should light up your worthless little life
Open up your eyes
Then she lit the torch
His eyes were burning pain she wanted to hear him scream
And this was not a dream
Abigail was out of control
She was laughing at his every scream
This was no more the clean revenge it should have been
Abigail was feeling like the ruler of Hell
The joy of causing pain
The wheelchair was really on fire
In the middle of dying Jonathan's charred body was
Falling down
Jonathan is dead
And Abigail is watching his wheelchair burn
The flames lick the wooden floor
Spreading to the curtains and then the draperies on the wall
Higher and higher they go
I am the fire I'm eating everything
I'll bring this mansion down through me they all must come
Spirits flying through the air
Spirits crossing over to the other side
To rest in peace and never die again
And to be with long gone friends
The ghosts of those who lived here in the past
They will use the flames to leave this EVIL house
Abigail is watching the spirits and the flames
Dancing hand in hand around her long black dress
Oh around and around they go until they touch
Abigail is on fire
Spirits flying through the air
Spirits crossing over to the other side
To rest in peace and never die again
And to be with long gone friends
There is no pain as Abigail is eaten by the flames
Her body starts to fade emptiness is growing inside
Slowly she's leaving her body behind
And the spirits are right by her side
Oh no here she goes her spirit is in the air
The others guide her to the flames where they all will disappear
Spirits flying through the air
Spirits crossing over to the other side
To rest in peace and never die again
And to be with long gone friends
But Abigail forgot one thing
Her own little twin
You could see the fire burn you could see the colours turn
From black to no return
The night began to cry rain from the sky
As the mansion died
Oh no it died oh no it died
Deep down below fire would not go
The crypt is still alive listen to the child that cries
I wonder what is wrong
It's so damp and cold in here could this be the home of fear
There's something in the dark that should be left alone
As if it had a grave of it's own
There's a body on the floor I hope there is no more
I think I'm stepping in blood
Too dark for me to see a dark you only feel
Dark that always must be
I see a child now I'm blind where did she go Oh no
Deep down below fire would not go
The crypt is still alive listen to the child that cries
Where did she go She must have slipped into the dark again
Not too far away I see a light
And there is Little One standing by the wall
The lantern in her hand is lighting up the coffin on the stand
Oh
I used to know your sister your eternal spirit twin
Oh but Abigail was way too busy with revenge
And now you're stuck in here on your own
A lonely soul who'll never ever find a home
Oh No
She cannot find her mommy cause mommy's in the floor
And she doesn't even know who her mother really is oh no
Only I and a few others know who her mother really is
The Countess The Countess The Countess
Mommy Mommy
Oh she cannot find her mommy
Mommy Mommy
Cause she's buried in the floor
But it's NOT your mommy you're looking for
IT'S YOURSELF
I wanna go home it's so cold down here
I don't like the dark
Where are you Mommy
Mommiiii
Will I ever see you again
Please come back and take me away from here

Mother Was Struck By This Infallible Idea
If She Could Paint My Portrait I Would Remain Immortal
And I Could Hang Downstairs Above The Fireplace
A Little Girl In Lace Not A Single Trace Of Crime

For Every Stroke She Painted A Little Life Was Ended
At Last I Felt So Weak I Could Not Even Speak
But In That Fatal Portrait My Spirit Came To Lfe Again
Oh Molly

MommyMommy
I'll Destroy YouI can't recall a night like this now all has gone amiss
In the silence there's no peace Only fear that cannot cease
Don't tell me I'm alone in nothingness
In my mind an approaching shape calls me on again
With no hope I stumble on I can only pray they were wrong
The Badlands loom ahead Dark and unknown Deep and wild
Driven out with no return Deviation our only crime
Their time will come in its turn
Pride hatred united into one
Nothing changes A creed I've seen before
And now in squalor two brothers reap what they've sown
When all of a sudden silver threads come floating down
Watch thou for the mutant The Devil is the father of deviation
Keep pure the stock of the Lord In purity our salvation
The norm is the will of God Blessed is the norm
Watch thou for the mutant
They descended from the sky Slowly strangling all life Beyond our darkest hope
They came So far away And changed our lives
When they brought us home Not our own A memory from my childhood dreams
We live again
Stillborn world Free and strong nature's son
Who could dethrone him The Feral King
Sweeping through the twilight of a dimming sky
Falling fire blinding panic stricken eyes
Falls with crashing thunder into his domain
Rending all asunder
All that he knows is dead or dying
All he sees around him now is change
Lord no more Empire turned to dust Fear takes hold
Who are these strangers What do they know
Where will I go I must resist
Let them have their fires Let them have their machines
Usurpers thieves and liars soon to choke on their greed
Vermin race See the face of your doom
I shall steal silent to where this began
Into my empire buried now by sand
There I'll wait Sit in state For my time To come again
Buried deep in stasis poison from within
They could not expect this Closer to the kill
I am one
Sire and son
Of the earth My rebirth awaits
The Feral King
Solar breath A monument to excess softly brushes my face
And burns too soon Wounds on cue Nothing to show
And yet you know Pride undone the way is lost
One last time before we lay these ghosts to rest
Petrified and self exiled I would throw myself into the sun
I am too sick weak and tired and I know the worst is to come
Under one unblinking eye cursed to live yet doomed to die
The universe under its own weight contracts and folds into its final fate
What am I I should have perished
But I'm all alone now All around me is void
How could it be that all creation lies in me
For eons I linger or maybe a fleeting moment
Something is building Wonder and resentment
Deeper and deeper I owe existence nothing
Mocking my fury creation takes root and explodes
I had the chance to create a perfect form
Devoid of malice Of peace and beauty born
When all was silent I could have stopped it all
Yet in my anger I only brought forth the storm again
The cycle begins And as I fade my last thought is only regret
In depths that pull ageless in the void before time
They come across an aged oak Now drawing close
Skinless fingers grip the trunk The sleeper wakes
Dappled light throws silhouettes on a dilapidated wall
Through scattered leaves the scent of an unwelcome dawn fill the senses drained of comfort warmth and hope Waking stupor fades too soon
And she's alone again A spectral form A tale of loss to tell remains untold
When memory finally fades what of the lost
If their voices cannot be heard alone they'll walk
And hunger for release Gone but not at peace
The lives that they once lived haunt them still
What kind of cruelty awaits beyond the waking world
Illumination denied to chosen few
Uncomprehending Without an ending
Purgatorial wounds never heal
For the whole of immemorial time that slides slowly by
They are hoping without knowing why they cannot die
In one enraptured host beasts and men collide
Voices sullen thoughts morose they soon fall into line
Subdue my mortal anguish
With vapid animals that feed on my decline
Where now is the prize promised in our name
As far as I can tell we've paid enough in shame
In tatters and voiceless like cattle
Wait in line patiently for the cull
One more injustice and two more wounds to heal
A legacy of blood that oils tyrannic gears
Wear your shackles lightly
Live in fear of reprisal or pay with your life
Enough is enough
Life is more than toil and duress
Now for better or worse
With no loved ones to pay for my mistakes
I can focus and make good my escape
If I fail then I will not die in vain
Either way I'll never follow again
Into the cold Out of the fold Under grey skies
I'll run 'til I die
Pursue my tracks Follow my bleeding feet A shot rings out
My final moments in verdant fields of green
At least I tried and died alive A peaceful smile etched on my faceBunga Bunga
Bunga Bunga
Bunga Bunga
I'm a moola junkie
Bucks run through my veins
Daily cash infusions
Dough is my cocaine
I'm a crook I'm a fraud I'm a cheater
In my tinted high end limousine
All the gread and the risk and the gamble
I'm a money made machine
The demon sleeps
In you and me
But he won't do
Forever
Do you like money sex and power
The everlasting law
Money sex and power
Gimme more gimme more gimme more
Do you like money sex and power
The never ending game
Money sex and power
I'm insane I'm insane I'm insane
I'm a horny engine
Powered by the drive
Greed for satisfaction's
Keeping me alive
All the whores and the sluts and the bitches
With their chambers of twilight and sin
All the lust and the zest and temptation
Very well then I give in
The demon sleeps
In you and me
But he won't do
Forever
Do you like money sex and power
The everlasting law
Money sex and power
Gimme more gimme more gimme more
Do you like money sex and power
The never ending game

Fell light flashing in the night
Peoples of the world stand side by side
We'll have ourselves a final ball
Seals break evil is awake
Get another drink while planets quake
Dance with the dead 'till skies will fall
And when stars will burst and mankind's been erased
Far far away we'll say we seized each of our days
Operation Supernova
We will dance 'till the party's over
For the first time for the last time
Now the day has come
Operation Supernova
Hold the line while the end comes closer
All the lovers all the haters
'Till the work is done
Sky's clear now the end is near
We just keep on groovin' waste no tear
All elements give what they got
Stars fall collapse to the core
Putting in my favourite song once more
As wild winds blow me to the gods
And when stars will burst and mankind's been erased
Far far away we'll say we seized each of our days
Operation Supernova
We will dance 'till the party's over
For the first time for the last time
Now the day has come
Operation Supernova
Hold the line while the end comes closer
All the lovers all the haters
'Till the work is done
Ohh
Operation Supernova
We will dance 'till the party's over
For the first time for the last time
Now the day has come
Operation Supernova
Hold the line while the end comes closer
All the lovers all the haters
'Till the work is done
Heads up
My bomb is on the way
She loves to be my lighter
This time
I blow her right away
Tonight she's my igniter
I'm a mean war machine
And my weapon is obscene
It's known as strongest fighter
Need no red light to thrill
No explosion overkill
My light's still shining brighter
Ohhh
Are you crying for more
Can't wait to fight the battle
Because sex is war
Ohhh
Are you crying for more
Sex is war
Sex is war
Sex is war
Blood boils
My flame begins to rise
The fuse is getting shorter
Can't stop
She goes off in the skies
All night I find no quarter
She's narcotic for my mind
Makes me deaf makes me blind
She causes sweet delusions
As the countdown resounds
All the walls are shaking 'round
We bang in great profusion
Ohhh
Are you crying for more
Can't wait to fight the battle
Because sex is war
Ohhh
Are you crying for more
Sex is war
Sex is war
Sex is war

When stillness and desert once covered the land
When Rock was a dark horse no Roll was on hand
A brand new species world conquer the place
Shocked rocked shook the musical base
Where one has been stillness now ear splitting sounds
The hell bells are ringing kickstarted hearts pound
In rivers through wastelands adrenalin flows
Moves thrills hits my body and soul
Dinosaurs are still alive
Dinosaurs they will survive
Please my mind and make me jive
Dinosaurs are still alive yeah
The world was besotted with glorious noise
Paradise cities and attics with toys
This flush made them lose all their fear of the dark
Killed their pain as fast as a shark
But even the keenest of heroes will fade
The mission is done but it's only their shape
Their legacy's saved and the spirit will last
Gods of Rock a singular class
Dinosaurs are still alive
Dinosaurs they will survive
Please my mind and make me jive
Dinosaurs are still alive yeah
Scratch me  bite me  kill me
Still on the loose no excuse
She blacks out the daylight
Caught in her squeeze cannot breathe
When she holds me real tight
Sly evil eyes suck me dry
Walking on the wild side
Hell what a treat head to feet
When she fights at first flight
Scream shout  knocked out
Still she wants more
She's a killer killer killer
She's after me tonight
She's a killer killer killer
She's eating me alive
With her wild and hungry roar
She is screaming out for more
She's a killer killer killer
One's not enough never stop
She's aiming higher
Roaming the streets with her cat eyes
As bright as fire
Claws made to fight gonna spike me
I can't defy her
Led by the thrill of a kill
There's a beast inside her
Scratch me  bite me  kill me
Scratch me  bite me  kill me
She's a killer killer killer
Cold heart black soul
I'm a nasty little guy
Vicious antic
'Cause I got the evil eye
I'm seeding the sleaze
And injecting the beast
As ever forever as ever forever
Don't waste your time
This is the deal
I will debauch you head over heels
But when I'm done I end in smoke
As ever forever as ever forever
The devil he may care
So catch me if you dare
We are we are we are
Hot stuff
We are we are we are
Real tough
We are we are we are
Sleaze deluxe
Sleaze deluxe
We are we are we are
Great shit
We are we are we are
Steel gift
We are we are we are
Sleaze deluxe
Sleaze deluxe
Ohh
Untamed ill famed
Got a mind that's so obscene
Bare meat sick deeds
Love 'em dirty love them mean
I'm spawn of hell
And take you under as well
As ever forever as ever forever
Just like a blitz I'm striking in
I'm wicked spook
Spreading vice and sin
Before you see I'm miles away
As ever forever as ever forever
I want it I need it so I'll make sure I seize it
My cross line will see it crash bang
I always beat it
Cold booze and hot lovin'
Is what reloads my power
I'm sorry dear darling
Already have my sights on you 
Close  up view
They call me egoshooter 
I'm shooting for the thrill
I'm an egoshooter 
The living overkill 
Like an egoshooter 
Infinite fire mode 
Call me egoshooter
'Till you are off the road
I'm an egoshooter
New highscore no fair play
My joystick moves the right way 
Babe don't you believe me 
Join in and play my mad game 
Next level on reset
I want you maiden targets
I see you you feel me
I'm sure you just want me to score
This means war
It feels good here six feet under
And I still wait and wonder
How could I stay there all the time
In my grave it´s warm and cozy
It´s safe no one disturbs me
I feel fine until the end of time
I´ve got some sad girls some bitches crying
Some pour souls more that are whining
Six shots in the back thanks for the attack
It feels good it feels fine this place is mine
This place is what I find it´s all mine
It´s my home I´m alone no one controls
This place is six feet under six feet under
In some nights I think of lifetime
Sunlight and how the Stars shine
Bit by bit I forget ´bout it
But I guess I´m feeling happy
Unstressed and sometimes sappy
On my own here on my wooden thone
I´ve got some sad girls some bitches crying
Some pour souls more that are whining
Six shots in the back thanks for the attack
It feels good it feels fine this place is mine
This place is what I find it´s all mine
It´s my home I´m alone no one controls
This place is six feet under six feet under
It feels good it feels fine this place is mine
This place is what I find it´s all mine
It´s my home I´m alone no one controls
This place is six feet under six feet under
Had a lot of guests here
A lot of flesh to chop
Each with a special flavour
And each with neck and crop
Welcome just step inside
My meat machinery
Don't be scared 'cause fear tastes bad to me
My name is Hannibal
Hannibal the cannibal
My name is Hannibal
and I want you
Let me pay your dinner
Look so frail and weak
Dude just use a service
Cause I want juicy meat
Now we come together
on my barbecue
Hot and spicy
Main course
That is you
My name is Hannibal
Hannibal the cannibal
My name is Hannibal
and I want you
I'm ticking like a ticking like a ticking
like a time bomb
ticking like a ticking lika a ticking
like a bomb
My name is Hannibal
Hannibal the cannibal
My name is Hannibal
and I want you
My name is HannibalThis is your first lesson in stress relief
Breathe  
Everyday I'm feeling like this
Everyday I am high
Settle down and have a smoke son
Tell me what's on your mind
This is getting to be so frustrating
Getting high is helping my life
I am not a criminal
Exhale  
Now don't you feel a lot better
Do you feel cleansed inside
I can tell you're stoned son
It's time to restart your mind
This is getting to be so irritating
They want to arrest me cause I get high
I am not a criminal
Not guilty
Skin of gray eyes of darkness
In the shadows bloody victims die
Satan Nocturnal Blasphemous Nosferatu
Demon spawn so intriguing
In the dead night you won't see it
try to find the demon's red eyes
He is from the 7th gate of
Hell Hell Hell Hell
With the fight in the night twisted pain
Cover eyes cause you think you're still alive
Run Run Run Run
Blood Blood
Comes out at night avoiding the light
to hunt and feed on victims
Lusting for blood craving the flesh
and internal organs
Blood
With the fight in the night twisted pain
Cover eyes cause you think you're still alive
El Chupacabra
I'm writing a suicide note
and you can't pull me out of this
my depression is too dark
And you can't pull me out of this
my depression is too smart
God can't pull me out of this
my depression is too obvious
I can't pull me out of this
my depression is too pissed
But I can tell you all of this
I don't care if I will be missed
Writing this suicide note
Inside my head I am better off dead
Something's possessingdepressing me
I don't know what it is
It constantly destroys and toys with me
This life is getting me pissed
Dead dead dead dead
dead dead dead dead
I'm fighting this suicide note
I knew it all
All along that I was gone
Do you think this is easy
Do you think life is easy
Now I am frozen in life preserved in Hell
I'll stay all night
Why is it that I wear this straight jacket
and the reasons for what
A slave for your gain scapegoat for the pain
It's selfishit's sicknessit's fetish
Open your mouth two barrels down your throat
bullets your last meal
I hate life I hate you
Reprimandedfor your stupidity
Embarrassmentfor your blindness
How do you like the taste of this life
I'll end your life
You've reached the end now here's your prize
A gunshotmy vengeance
A gunshotmy hate
Your demise will be  by my hands
Strap you to a chair
Beat you brainlessly
Cut you up than leave
Now you bleed for me
Your demise will be  by my hands
Fatal shots are launched
Evil found its place
behind the blue eyes
of this very face
You will bleed for me
What is it I can't hear what you say
Can't hear what you say
What is it I can't hear what you say
the guns are in the way
And there is laughing
You don't even exist
Deny everything nothing is real
Rely on no one opportunity steals
Tighten your collar and loosen your belt
As the rich get richer the poor go to hell
Close your eyes drown in the flood
Cover your lies drenched in blood
Scratch at my skin tear out my brain
Scream to the heavens call me insane
Black from disease sick of screams
Scared of words and TV scenes
Deception lust children raped
Sick of life no escape
Greed
Nothing to lose money to gain
Smell of sex endless pain
Deception Betrayal Lies
Cracked out whores killing friends
No remorse walking dead
Under the skies above my sheets
Visions of saviors and rotting meat
Hardcore dreams and twisted thoughts
Happiness cannot be bought
Life is like a pressure riot and my head is caving in
You wanna see me stoned you wanna cough a little
You wanna trench pill zones you're gonna puke a little
You wanna hold my hand you better be a giver
You know in this game I am a helpless lifer
You wanna know my strength you're gonna feel some weakness
You wanna invert this you're gonna get some sickness
You wanna get inside you wanna make it clearer
You wanna see denial look in the lying mirror
Is this the way you like it Is this your honesty
Invert the perfect kill dust Insert it into me
There is no god that walks beside me
Controversy Anarchy has taken over me deep inside me
You're gonna get real stoned You're gonna get uplifted
You have to give me your soul You're gonna get enlisted
You're gonna feel agony until I am finished
You're gonna lose everything but you'll never miss it
Darkness calms my soul
Depression wraps around my face
Shovel the pain that won't escape
Look at me now I'm paranoid
Searching to find to fill the void of
this horrible life and I'm a mess
Will the numb phase ever change
The fears have started to mate in me
Leaving me blind and shaken up
And now I barely feel alive
Look in my eyes I want to die
So sick and tired of I'll try
Watching me live my selfish life
It's right before my eyes filth and hate not disguised
A virgin's sacrificed bleeding eyes homicide
It's a snuff porno film watching sex as they kill
It's an uneasy sight antichrist rape at will
Shocking to believe and it's on the screen
all this raging and torment nothing to me
This is disgustingly entertaining to me
all this screaming and torture nothing to me
It's right before my eyes rape and death not disguised
It's a snuff porno film watching sex as they kill
Destroy
I am dishonored disheveled of what I see
I'm watching  
I am dishonored disheveled at what I see
I'm watching pain
I am dishonored disheveled at what I see
now fuck it
It's right in front of me and it's on the screen
I can't believe I saw the soul rise right from
the body and this tortured soul Hell has
took its toll as I take control of my cock
I'm jerking off to all the blood on her
face you just can not tell if it's real or fake
I guess that's why I watch the rape
scenes over and over again getting off
mouth taped shut raped her raw
blood on cock knife in twat turn this off
Murderthere's blood on the windows
Torturethere's blood on the flowers
Perverthis head's now his football
Guttedguts exposed for all
The asshole is a virgin his guts will rain in blood
One more pet homicide take all your pets inside
The asshole is a virgin he's now an amputee
Intestines used for a noose the killer's on the loose
Murderthere's blood on the windows
Guttedguts exposed for all
Everythingeverything is covered in your pet's blood
Can't fight the urgethe urge to kill
Smiling is projectilethis belongs to no one loose in the world
Feeding off of other's confusion
Sober and broke fearing the institution
Mental painProminent are the scars of yesterday
Mental painProminent are the scars from all the years
Don't leave your pets outside
The meaning of lifethe meaning of what
Just remember that the way he thinks is not like you
It starts like this when I wake up
Everybody's gone smiles turn to dust
Nausea sickness blindly shaking projectile vomiting
quivering
to me everybody sees when they look at me
never what's inside of me no one pities me
no one's helping me It's always only me
animosity overcoming me It's so depressing
scarring me Novocain to me fucking killing me
solitude
I am deciding ignore me blindly
It's satisfying to know I'm dying
Vulgarly jaded existence faded life is naked
severing
searching me it's in back of me
now in front of me it's overwhelming
satisfied so sadistically It's destroying me
You know what I mean insulting me
nervous wrecking me redefining me
it's right in front of in front of me
and inside of me it has taken me
down
you are not the only one who sees life through screwed up eyes
I sever the health sever the nerve
Sever the stem at the root
I sever my wrist sever my life
Sever myself at the throat
Life is ending I'm not sorry for the mistakes I have made
I am real from disasters in my mind
Subconscious unknown cost
Rage Rage Rage Rape
Insane aggression mutilate obsession
trying to forget her younger years
Insane logic hidden in the closet
Burning learning her weakest fears
Darkness is priceless pain gives her pleasure
Cutting herself does not shed a tear
Burning the flesh black vomit through a flashback
Her mom's been gone for 13 years
Raping hershe's feeling himHe's forcing in
She tends to mutilate herself because her
life's gone wrong
It feels like ecstasy that razor blade
is her god
She thinks her life is over but she can't
hear the call
Of another selfabuser that has been pushed
too far
Hate Hate Hate Rage
Backward regression mutilate confession
trying to forget my younger years
Insane logic hidden in my closet
Burning learning my weakness and fears
Darkness is priceless pain gives me pleasure
Cutting myself I do not shed a tear
Burning the flesh black vomit through a flashback
My mind's been gone for 13 years
Destroying medeep inside of meI'm wearing thin
If you try to come inside you might lose your mind
This has been inside me for a very long time
It's just now being told life is cold like this razor I hold
And I am so thankful to have lost all selfcontrol
I woke up today it was fucking disgusting
upon opening my eyes to the light of day
nauseated by the world's pathetic state
the feeling of the hand that has you by
the spine is tightening its grip and destroying
the very emotion of this lackadaisical lifestyle
that finds itself repeating over and over
the life it is not meant to have
the smell of vomit still lingers in the
nostrils society is decaying and descending
into one big useless rut and with smoke
burned smiles I face toward the sky
this life is fucking disgustingEure Majestät dies ist der Kopf des Verräters
Seine Gefolgschaft stirbt im Frost
Mit gebrochenen Knochen und offenem Fleisch
Die Propheten verkünden eine neue Zeit
Das Licht wird und begleiten
Auf unserer Reise zum Ende der Welt
Dieser letzter Schwur wird hier nicht verhallen
Mein Herz wird verloren sein an jenem Morgen
Für die Hoffnung
Für die Freiheit
Abends ruhe ich unter Bäumen
Wenn das Rot der Sonne in meine leere Brust strömt
Für die Kraft in der Nacht und am Tage
Für die nächsten 1000 Jahre
A sky painted in the scarlet bends over me
I remember I still feel the greatness
The enchanting plain cloaked in silence
Walk the dim lane that bears so many memories
As trees sway in hazy dusk
Past landscapes devoured by darkness
Oh this wistful atmosphere grasps my heart
When I touch transient rapture
When I long for life
I shield myself for some blithe days
and peaceful reverie
But yet sorrow is unrelenting and it recurs
My tears fall for you  mother earth
My tears fall for you
Our anguish is divine love
For the loss of eternal life
A life in mayhem
Calm my fear in soothing dreams
And long promenades
As I watch how the birds leave
To forget all the painful knowledge
Just for once
I don't belong here anymore
In fear I perceive
I vanish into a cold sword
The red streams flow everywhere
A grey curtain and rain everywhere
Bury me inside the fields where grass grows tall
I will be gone with the morning fog
Come wrath cover me sweetly
In your arms I could sleep
I cannot sleep
I will never sleep
I will never see you again
Mit der Stille die nur der Abend hervorbringen kann
seufzt der Wald ein letztes Mal
Nichts als dunkle Gebeine bleiben von dem
was einst ein Meer aus Flammen war
Wie blutige Tränen fielen die Kleider der stummen uralten Bäume
Eins sangen sie zum Lied des Windes
der von weit her kam
um sich im Meer der Farben zu baden
Das Rauschen seiner warmen Worte ist vergessen
Nun bringt er den sicheren Tod
Ich atme den letzten Hauch des Lebens und nehme in mich auf
was bald vergeht
I close my eyes outside in the rain
As the day draws to an end
In darkness death lurks silently
And fear crawls and caws behind me
I will wait for you by the fire
When you approach the glade
Together we'll watch the dance of the flames
That reminds us of old and precious tales
At dawn we will wander over the hills
When mist rises from the dale
With the gentle waft of the gale
The air smells like great forgotten times
When eagles reigned the empyreal sky
And wolves roamed through moonlit nights
Versteckt in den Wäldern
der Zeitlosigkeit
bin ich endlich ich
in der Einsamkeit
Fühle die stürmende Nacht
die Stille die erwacht
Dann der Gesang des Windes
Luft mit Macht
Tanz der Bäume
Bald ist der Wald ein Meer
und es sind keine Träume
Für mich ist niemand mehr
Der der die Erkenntnis nicht kennt
Immer wieder schlägt meine Faust
ins Nichts in den leeren Staub
Weit entfernt von der Zerteilung
im Licht der Heilung
finde nur ich mich
Keinen anderen Weg sehe ich
Wie schnell das Feuer wieder entfacht
wenn die Phantome flüstern
Wie aus grauen Träumen erwacht
das Nichts mich umarmt
Ewiger Zorn
Lebensform der Leere
Erhebst dich über allem Sein
Eine Doktrin der Lügen
ersticke dich selbst
Verschlinge deine Zunge
geniesse die Langsamkeit
Enter the path that leads astray
Up the hills passing the forest gate
Walking the steep and stony way
Beside the forbidden sphere
A sphere of delightful gardens and open graves
An old desolate lodge hidden and fenced
There comes the wind that caresses the trees
That caresses ourselves as we lurk in the moonlight
Maybe we know the craft of the night
As we listen to the sounds of life
Drowning in grainy darkness
We are composed here
Absorbing eyes cannot see this key
I'll burn a mark on my chest
To create an increase of happenings
A footstep that regains its place
One way belongs to each of us
An entire sight in this role
This excuses of life
Will guide you into
nothing
After all mirth will respire
With every fall age will come
And return to the beginning
After all mirth will respire
With every fall age will comeSo what if it's 1999 
I've sworn that life should be all mine 
And so I sold my soul 
To achive that one and only goal 
And see those empty eyes 
Just people expecting compassion 
For their cries 
Just the cattle in an endless stream 
Expect to be heard above the screams 
To bleed again 
To cry again 
To bleed again 
To bleed again 
To cry again 
To bleed again 
And see those empty eyes 
And then just realized 
How the unjust defies 
Their own godgiven lives 
And so you'll bleed again 
And so you'll bleed again 
You say they will save you 
I say they'll rather kill you 
And then not have to reed 
The offspring you breed 
Cause there is no god 
There is not one to trust 
And if that's what you believed 
How clearly you've been decieved 
How clearly have you been decieved 
And see those empty eyes 
And then just realized 
How the unjust defies 
Their own godgiven lives 
And see those empty eyes 
And then just realized 
How the unjust defies 
Their own godgiven lives

I see exactly what it is he despise 
I see he thinks it's a matter of size 
And to me that's no fucking surprise 
I feel the world with my enemy's senses 
I stare with hatred through his eyes' lenses 
I hate it all all that I see 
I think it's all out to get just me 
I try to love but it's hatred I feel

It's time for the seven o'clock show 
They can tell all we need to know 
Fresh footage from another war 
Much bloodier than what we've seen before before 
There are people who've seen worse 
They were present where the devil cursed 
Their camera the all seeing eye 
Let the world know the truly defiled 
The truly 
The truly defiled 
The truly 
The truly defiled 
Back at home we see the show 
But nothing more than they want us to know 
It's the edited truth of war 
Entertain and restrain me some more some more 
There are people who've seen more 
Seen the grinding teeth of war 
Fed their children to the warmachine 
And done things you wouldn't believe 
They are 
The truly 
The truly defiled 
They're the truly 
The truly defiled 
Byt they don't know 
Who the fuckruns the show 
The same who are building the weapons 
Own broadcasts for warring reasons 
Byt they don't know 
CNN runs the show 
The same who are building the weapons 
Own broadcasts for warring reasons 
They sell they sell they sell they sell

Pain can eduacte you 
Make you breathe a certain way 
Make you sense life 
Make you sense life 
So when the needle penetrates 
And leaves the mark behind 
It's the only thing aside from scars 
On my body you'll find 
Those memories from my past 
Things I've dealt with before 
It's just my way to make them last 
My skin is my own epitaph 
And in the future 
Always cherish that day 
When I set it all straight 
And learned to breathe a certain way 
Hate can make you numb 
It can eat out your soul 
It'll kill you it'll kill you 
So when you feel that hatred inside 
It's time for a new direction 
And I'm not talking religion here 
A silimar infection 
I'm talking talking about you 
I'm talking about your new tattoo 
Those memories from my past 
Things I've dealt with before 
It's just my way to make them last 
My skin is my own epitaph 
And in the future 
Always cherish that day 
When I set it all straight 
And learned to breathe a certain way
I'm a sight for sore eyes 
You can tell how I feel 
If you try to save me 
You'll know it's for real 
I flushed it all down the drain 
For a real kind of low 
And I know the highway 
Taught me all I wanted top know 
You say I'm just a dog 
And I won't argue on that 
I kinda like them furry beings 
At least they know where joy is at 
You say I'm not human 
That too I can't deny 
To me the entire human race 
Are rats in disguise 
A sight for sore eyes 
But I made something of myself 
I can stay in the open 
Never told a lie twice 
To me that's a real token 
So when it's time to say goodbye 
And travel beyond 
I'll wear my happy face 
So you remember me when I'm gone 
A sight for sore eyes 
A sight for sore eyes 
A sight for sore eyes
It took so long to see 
To learn to believe 
And I know you're hurting 
I know how it feels 
To cut yourself from the other world 
Be relieved of your strings 
It's just heartbreaking 
It's so mindeating 
But was it worth it 
Just tell me what you think 
Burn inside forevermore 
You have to move on now 
But remember the past 
Just cherish what it taught you 
Make those memories last 
Let them in let them in to haunt you 
But was it worth it 
Just tell me what you think 
Burn inside forevermore 
You have to move on now 
Just let it grow within you 
Just let it inside 
In time you'll know that 
It was the best for you 
But remember the past 
Just cherish what it taught you 
Just make those memories last 
Let them in let them in to haunt you

For the human race 
You will see 
There is nothing we can change 
Life is fragile 
Life is fragile 
Life is fragile 
Life is fragile 
I do think 
That if the planet was alive 
Not just lived on 
But with a pulse inside 
She wouldn't care 
Or even know 
How we all got to be so fucking low 
When facts are faced 
For the human race 
You will see 
There is nothing we can change no 
Life
It's about to happen 
It's coming now 
Will be revealed 
Life's mystery 
It's about to happen 
It's coming now 
Will be revealed

Feed the fire of anger and hate
For a moment you will taste
The evil that your mind can create
Trust  deep in your soul
Hate  you can't control
Discipline of hate
Spread the world of death and shame
Discipline of hate
Forget your god become a slave
Organized
Like flocks of cattle you share
The same ideology
Rock bottom for life in society
Trust  deep in your soul
Hate  you can't control

No guilt no pain no sorrow
In this head
In the eyes of god you seek
Forgiveness
Free yourself
No reason to be afraid
You have to follow your own way
So you can finally feel
The bliss of serving your own will
No life without awareness
Only pain
Spend so much time in madness
A mistake
Time to change
No longer wasting the years
you must shed all your fears
Before it comes to an end
You must bow the
Truth  in your spirit
Truth  in your mind
Can't  avoid feeling
The massive force of the mind
No guilt
In this head
In the eyes of god you seek
Forgiveness
Time to change
No longer wasting the years
you must shed all your fears
Before it comes to an end
You must bow the
Truth  in your spirit
Truth  in your mind
Can't  avoid feeling
The massive force of the mind
Truth  in your spirit
Truth  in your mind
Can't  avoid feeling
The massive force of the mind

Fire consumes everything around

Ice melting
A virus spreads
In time humanity is dead
All is lost
Gods are gone
Religion never sees the dawn
Losing time

Imminent the pressure of a perfect prophecy
I can see it as a growing possibility
Sacrifice the day to find
The end is born to cleanse mankind

Raise your soul
Here in the light
Of darkness end of times
There I see
In front of me insanity
A bitter life to seek revenge
A bitter end
I'll turn my back to what I lost
And make amends
Raise your soul
Here in the light
Of darkness end of times
There I see
In front of me insanity
A breath of life we will ascend
And without end
Embrace all life respect the earth
For what is worth
Raise your soul
A bitter life to seek revenge
A bitter end
Raise your soul
In the mouth the taste of blood
On the hands the trace of hate
Words cut sharper than a blade
Attitudes that time will dictate
You can't hide  from me
Take off your mask  for me
Show yourself  to me
Now you are  my enemy
From the eyes a tear drips
In the heart sadness beats
Words don't mean anything
Attitudes you can't understand
You can't hide  from me
Take off your mask  for me
Show yourself  to me
Now you are  my enemy
My hate unveils the mystery of your flesh
In your decay a reason to celebrate
On your knees
You look to me and you perceive
The sight of death is so alive
In the mouth the taste of blood
On the hands the trace of hate
Words cut sharper than a blade
Attitudes that time will dictate
You can't hide  from me
Take off your mask  for me
Show yourself  to me
Now you are  my enemy
You see Sinistry
Your eyes Monopolize
In you there's nothing left to gain
Securing endless disarray
You're lost you're blind
Fascists control your mind
Civilization
Slaves to the TV
A revolution
Burns inside of me
You see Ignorance
Your eyes Innocence
Born in the sickness of their hate
Media strives to reinstate
The fear to dream
Reality to be
Civilization
Slaves to the TV
A revolution
Burns inside of me
You see Sinistry
Your eyes Monopolize
In you there's nothing left to gain
Securing endless disarray
You're lost you're blind
Fascists control your mind
Civilization
Slaves to the TV
A revolution
Burns inside of me
Now I hear my internal voice
In my visions just my mind
How can we end this darkened misery
Abandoned dreams lost in time
Walking forcing my soul to rise
Letting go of the past we create a new paradise
Destiny embrace immortality
Rising up no fear in my eyes
Die Die Die
I now know why
It's in my eyes
I'll never die
Envy breeds your disgrace
Slowly leading you off your trail
Rise up once again for your life
A chosen path that we will not fail
Die Die Die
I now know why
It's in my eyes
I'll never die
Now I hear my internal voice
In my vision just in my mind
Walking forcing my soul to rise
Destiny is in my eyes
Die Die Die
I now know why
It's in my eyes
I'll never die
He descended the stairs of illusion
And opened the door of conceit
He sat at the table of falsehood
To devour a banquet of deceit
He tasted hypocrisy
Spat on the plate of misery
Drank the liquid of domination
And for dessert slavery
He left in search of wealth
It was part of his stubbornness
To get in the street of greed
To overrun benevolence and kindness
He tasted hypocrisy
Spat on the plate of misery
Drank the liquid of domination
And for dessert slavery
He entered the tower of power
And ordered with no pity
He proclaimed himself owner of the world
With a streak of cruelty
He tasted hypocrisy
Spat on the plate of misery
Drank the liquid of domination
And for dessert slavery
Dark soul Owner of the world
Dark soul Owner of the world
Dark soul Owner of the world
He tasted hypocrisy
Spat on the plate of misery
Drank the liquid of domination
And for dessert slavery
Sit on the chair
I feel the change inside of me
What was I
What am I
Now I can see
Closing my eyes
Judgement time
Last memories
Last life
My spirit flies
I can believe
Is this insanity or sanity
Where is my soul
In the last world
In my head
Many questions
The light is coming
My past is a mistery
It's my reality
Closing my eyes
Judgement time
Last memories
Last life
My spirit flies
I can believe
Is this insanity or sanity
Where is my soul
In the last world 
With a nod of his head
And a wave of his hand
Pain and blood covering my eyes
It's the reign reign of lies
March Destroy Slay
Crushing breaking my brain
March Destroy Slay
Under his command
Nations fall before his might
Lay shattered at his feet
That is their plight
He will never accept the light
March Destroy Slay
Crushing breaking my brain
March Destroy Slay
Under his command
Reign of lies
March Destroy Slay
Crushing breaking my brain
March Destroy Slay
Under his command
You feel so lame why was I wrong
Such a bad choice to fight me alone
There is no change you could have known
That in my fists lie is your doom
There is a cause for everything I do
My growing anger now devouring you
Seek for the truth
Seek it in you
You know the shit I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear
I feel ashamed and don't know why
I ever trusted a shit like you
There was no change I could have known
That in that friend I had a foe
There is a cause for everything I do
My growing anger now devouring you
Seek for the truth
Seek it in you
You know the shit I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear
I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear for you
You reap what you sow
I had to bear
Thousands of stone eyes seal my fate
Woth rotten mouths full of hate
Feeding my poison
Serpent's hands
Give me a silver goblet
With the devil's brand
I feel my body enter a shell
Closing my eyes
Living this hell
I check my calendar
There are no appointments
i cover great distances
Between past and present
Returning from a tunnel
To once again behold the light
I'm stuck in my body
Immune to wrong or right
I feel my body enter a shell
Closing my eyes
Living this hell
I check my calendar
There are no appointments
i cover great distances
Between past and present
Returning from a tunnel
To once again behold the light
I'm stuck in my body
Immune to wrong or right
I feel my body enter a shell
Closing my eyes
Living this hellWaking up at night with unstoppable quivers
Raw meat the only way to stop my shiver
Keep their remains in the fridge for my next fix
Don't want old bitches I prefer young chicks
Nibble on her perky tits like strawberry jelly
Extinguish the hunger in my famished belly
Chewing my way below her mangled waist
Her clit and labia with such delicious taste
Munching on fingers as if they were fries
Using a fork to peel out your swollen bloodshot eyes
Need to consume humans to achieve my high
My ultimate trip comes as you slowly suffer and die
Shivering in abstinence for human flesh devourment
Out cruising for hookers in my rusted van of terror
Flashing dollar bills to get your attention
You'll soon meet your maker in my chamber of horror
Don't ask your savior for divine intervention
Blunt force trauma with a hammer to the head
Strung up on meat hooks and left for dead
For some weeks you'll hang there to rot
My own private slaughterhouse is what I've got
Need their corpses to be putrid and smelly
Time to empty all the bowels and your belly
Cold steel piercing dead flesh
Gut you like a slaughtered pig draining the blood
Entrails pouring out as the tub gets over flood
Time to cleanse my fucking soul
Now I need a bath in this oozing pool of gore
Now I must feel
Their insides on my skin
Masturbation with fermented entrails
Start to rub my cock with a handful of innards
Shooting my load into the abdominal cavity
My orgasm is great
Beaten and sedated naked on the table
It's hard to scream with vocalcords disabled
Drugged up and ready for my grotesque experiment
From neck to feet covered in piss and excrements
Time to die filthy bitch
Stuffing her juicy crotch with a rusty twelve gauge of mine
Don't need no lubrication her menstrual blood works fine
Fucking her tiny asshole while I squeeze the trigger
Both barrels blazing so the cavity gets bigger
Her mangled cadaver gets my juices flowing
Rape torture and sodomy is what keeps me going
Tits blown off and lying in chunks on the floor
Yet my urge is not satisfied I hunger for more
Smashing your fucking face
Raping your bleeding mouth
Peeling out your eyes
Sluts like you I despise
Double barrel penetration
Get ready for my backshot penetration
Double barrel penetration
Uterovaginal mastication
Abduction is the way I start my day
Finally all my planning has paid off
Eager to dismember
Your skin so sweet and tender
Strapped to the chair
Degrading you right to your face
Gagged
Puking all over the place
It's time to finally shut you up
Stabbing you viciously
Watching your face was priceless
Blood Splattered Satisfaction
I dealt you away repeat
Good  Now your times up
Preparation has paid off by  Never quitting
Disposing of your body was a pleasure
No one will ever find you
I'm sure they will look hard  but only I know you're in my backyard
Razor to your mouth cutting away lips and tongue
Forcing the remains down your fucking throat
Regurgitation commencing mixing blood with puke
The stench of it all fills me with such delight
Ramming my swollen member up her butchered twat
While I decapitate her with my sharpened axe
On her severed head I'm soon ready to cum
Bury my face in her entrails the fun has just begun
A perverted sensation fills my mind
To murder fuck and mutilate every bitch that I find
First I mutilate
Time to masturbate
Then I ejaculate
Ramming my swollen member up her butchered twat
While I decapitate her with my sharpened axe
Snapshots are taken to feed my inner demon
To be spread out later and covered with semen
Covered with semen
My basement is filled with oozing piles of the deceased
Ready to fulfil my twisted and perverted fantasies
Sensation comes over me as I start the insision
From her neck down to her perenium with surgical precision
Torso is randomly punctured with a sharp butcherknife
All wounds I fuck in ecstasy the thrill I recieve is so intense
Her sweet blood as my lubrication
First I kill them then leave them to decompose
Before I start the dismemberment
Aroused by the stench of their putrid innards
Kill you gut then I fuck you
My necrophile urges is overwhelming
The remains dissolved in acid
Cunts and tits are kept as trophies
What choice have we but to worship the sun
Else the idolatry of beauty and the myths of transformation
For a life already laden with every species of failure
A grasping hand is cracked and leathery to the tough a voice
Cries not to be abandoned
A final mirage enchants
Blood engulfs the eves
Wending through the cycles of mania
1000 tiny ropes drag a body to the ground
The canvas of the dream a filthy tattered rag
The gods gigantic in power
Swing after swing of the iron axe
Shoreline conflagration as I take a last look
Exile through wastes of ocean
Last flames that engulfed my world
Breath of life and cloud
Black clouds which obscure
And devour celestial beings
Cosmic feast
Dizzy from all forms of blood
Beast god man
All screaming
Agony in collective ignorance
Called upon by thyself
Thyself being a part of all life
In the sickness
Quarantined in pure paranoia
There remains no monuments
To our vanity
No cenotaphs
To subsumed glory
Buried by the weight of years
We fashioned fate from the tyranny
Of thought
And the failure of noble intent
The failure of noble intent
And the great river of our blood roars in protest
Tributaries swallowed by the
Grim god of silence
The god of silence
Relentlessly we wove the skeins
Heedless of our doom
Lashing to our lives
The promise of failure
And I will build within myself
A monument of flagellation
I will silence my tongue
And sacrifice myself to the empty vault of the firmament
Humming separately away
Left inward with untrained process
Towards separation
From the path that bleeds towards creation
Persistence of the morose
Murder thy kingdom of ash
Self deceivingly stretched upon nails
A forceless act
Science is a god
A tool like all gods
Connectivity to the open sky
Beholding the kingdom of earth
Strangling in vines
Crawling through life's incessance
Insect messiah body and blood
Mutual sustenance
Human blood on rotting leaves
Clot and freeze
Into fetid venous ropes
A groaning pulsing mesh of shackles
Engrams overlay anew day of Ashura flagellant march
To mock our impotent cries to bind
And now this bed is a tomb
And home's threshold gives only a sinking chill
Because no matter what it ends this way
With me taking your body to the fireY'all know about sixtynine
Burnin' bones and bedside time
Once again we meet tonight
Get that touch of a magical night
We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break through the ice
You give us fever
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
The time is right for a ride tonight
To be with you I'd risk a fight
My stick is tight my blood is hot
Let's do it right here on the spot
We're gonna hit it
We're gonna kick it
We're gonna break through the ice
You give us fever
You give us sweat
You're gonna make us live it twice
Tonight long stick goes boom
Tonight long stick goes boom
Just got outta high school actin' like a jerk
Ain't got no money ain't got no work
Scratchin' 'round for beaver
Scratchin' 'round for bread
No friends no convictions
Man it's like you're dead
Bad boys  rag dolls
Ain't gonna let you down
Sex machines and rock 'n' roll queens
Turn the spotlight on
Pick up a guitar kick out a sound
The music is hard and the music is loud
Got one helluva band one helluva show
That's one thing you all should know
Bad boys  rag dolls
Ain't gonna let you down
Sex machines and rock 'n' roll queens
Turn my body on
Oh Alright
Come on now   
Get a life
Get a life gather up
Flat on my back in a hotel bar
With the sound of a jukebox in my head
Wonderin' how I came so far
Truth be known I should've been dead yeah
Cruisin' around in a beat up car
High noon comes in a four door saloon
Spending the night with a ten dollar whore
Private hell in a padded room
Playin' the outlaw
Takin' the back door
Playin' the outlaw
Listen kids to the story so far
Never get caught with a five ace hand
Don't shoot the man with the iron star
You can bet the hangman won't understand
The judge's wife don't ever cheat
But her daughter's body can bend the law
Can't stand the lovin' can't stand the heat
Life's for livin' and that's for sure
Playin' the outlaw
Takin' the back door
Playin' the outlaw
Playin' the outlaw
Takin' the back door
Playin' the outlaw
Playin' the outlaw
Brother around 
My mother was a bgirl
My old man was a tramp
Some folks say they conceived me
On a landing ramp
I was only fourteen
Took to petty crime
Stole from supermarkets
With this girlfriend of mine
Now I'm nearly twenty
Sick in heart and brain
Haven't got the courage
My life is down the drain
No roots no home no country
No hope no faith no luck
If there's a God in heaven
He doesn't give me bucks
No selfrespect no honor
No family no cash
No church and no religion
I'm only human trash
Now I'm nearly twenty
Sick in heart and brain
Haven't got the courage
My life is down the drain
American Woman stay away from me
American Woman mama let me be
Don't come a hangin' around my door
I don't wanna see your face no more
I got more important things to do
Than spend my time growin' old with you
Now Woman I said stay away
American Woman listen what I sayayayayayay
American Woman get away from me
American Woman mama let me be
Don't come a knockin' around my door
Don't wanna see your shadow no more
Coloured lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes
Now Woman I said get away
American Woman listen what I sayayayay
American Woman said get away
American Woman listen what I say
Don't come a hangin' around my door
Don't wanna see your face no more
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your ghetto scenes
Coloured lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes
Now Woman get away from me
American Woman mama let me be
Go gotta get away gotta get away now go go go
I 'm gonna leave you woman
Gonna leave you woman
Byebye Byebye Byebye Byebye
You 're no good for me

Gonna look you right in the eye
Tell you what I 'm gonna do
You know I 'm gonna leave
You know I 'm gonna go
You know I 'm gonna leave
You know I 'm gonna goo woman
I 'm gonna leave you woman
Goodbye American Woman
Goodbye American chick
Standing at the station
Waitin' for the train
No money for a BLT
Can't afford the plane
Sat me down in a smoker
Rolled me up a jay
Time is up runnin' hot
This boy is on his way
I'm on the run I'm on the run
Loaded like a gun
I'm on the run I'm on the run
Silver bullet to the sun
Meet a million people
Tell me what to do
All the slimy leachesyuk
Make me feel so blue
But the booze in the bus
Hot legs round the neck
State to state coast to coast
Hey guys I'll be back
I'm on the run I'm on the run
Loaded like a gun
I'm on the run I'm on the run
Silver bullet to the sun
I'm on the run I'm on the run
Loaded like a gun
I'm on the run I'm on the run
Silver bullet to the sun
I wanna kiss my baby in a Cadillac
Drivin' by a chauffeur sittin' in the back
Johnny you can drive us anywhere
Cause I need time before arrivin' there
Drivin' through the city to the concert hall
Headin' for the sound I hear some rock 'n' roll
I told the driver come on let's go through the door
I wanna do it to the music but I need some more
Hey now backseat rock 'n' roll
Hey now do it with your soul
Hey now backseat rock 'n' roll
Hey now do it with your soul
Drivin' through the hall straight ahead to the stage
The music's growin' high upon our lover's cage
She's rockin' me and I'm rollin' her
People peepin' through the windows I don't care
With your soulYou showed me things the secrets of your eye The magic circle
That glows and shimmers always through the night
A promise spoken of wonders I could do A chain unbroken
A road so straight but only for a few
The sun was black the day was dark as coal Not unusual
I saw the hours as something I could throw away
But there I saw it the writing's clear as ice My soul was aching
Now I knew my home and where to go
Devil Sun  Yes I like your way
Devil Sun  I'll always be your slave
Devil Sun  You got so much to say
Devil Sun  You command I obey
You showed me things the secrets of your eye The magic circle
That glows and shimmers always through the night
A promise spoken of wonders I could do A chain unbroken
A road so straight but only for a few
Do you know that I like your craft
And we shall go you will lead the path
Do you see I'm the newborn son
And I praise the god the Devil Sun
The serpent crawled the way up from his underground hole
Bitter unfulfilled quite nasty and old
Wants everyone to drink his toast the poisonous chalice
And we listen like hypnotized to the snake and his talk
You rise from the ashes to the beauty of grace and delight
I know deep inside it's done with mirrors and smoke
You fill my apartment with magic and treason beware
I see your lizard eyes in every man we must all take care
And the serpent said Richness
I'll give it now to you
Just keep on what you're doing
To the devil his due
I'm everywhere the great lord
I see every sin
No matter how you hide behind your doors
I will always sneak in
In every single corner of the world yes there you are
You're spreading your feathers like a god a true superstar
You fill my apartment with magic and treason beware
I see your lizard eyes in every man we must all take care
Bitter and fucked up and blue
You know the serpent is you
Spreading the poison you can
Venom's black in every man
Snake of Christ you do us wrong
Oh serpent with a deadly tongue
Bitter and fucked up and blue
You know the serpent is you
Apocalyptic on Sundays I am
Before the altar of boredom I kneel
I plow an even deeper furrow
In grief's eternal wheel oh god
I sink faster into despair
And sorrow is my only reward
I can't hear music no more
Not a single black stupid chord
Swimming on a lazy afternoon
In a sea of doom
And I cry me a river of dying angels
And I try to be strong
I'm afraid of the sunshine that tries to reach me
Now it won't be long
The well of pain and gloom
The sea of doom
All those heartaches stole my world
The shit of a life time should have been gold
I put the blinds down go back to bed
The lair of numbness the losers keep
I sink faster into despair
And sorrow is my only reward
I can't hear music no more
Not a single black stupid chord
Drowning on a lazy afternoon
In a sea of doom
There's a dead man in my bed
Got no legs got no head
Darkness lackeys underneath
Satan's offspring licks my knees
A ring of demons around my bed
Curse the life that I have lead
Something nasty's soiling my sheet
Spawn of evil at my feet
Horns and claws rotten nose
Hell is sucking on my toes
A ring of demons around my bed
Curse the life that I have lead
As I fill my life with fear
I clearly see the end is near
Satan's smell is in my room
A place to sleep becomes a tomb
Demon voices speak as one
Hell is fire shit and sand
We come from the sewers to pirate this fat land this hour
We march in the streets of skulls to take back what ours
White thrash of the south
We shake the foundations of power with lead and with force
Burn the pillars of greed let society fall
Rebel rousers drunks and punks and brave invaders
We plague the cities with fire we are in control
Storm the bastions with metal and rock'n'roll
The oceans of oppression the killing hand
The black flag of vengeance rise over our land
Anarchy warning a note from the underworld
The pirates of the heart are sailing to steal and destroy
Rebel rousers drunks and punks and brave invaders
So no one's nice enough to paint your face
With red or blue or black or white
A snapshot of your truer you
To show you what no mirror can do
I do it myself but I don't like myself
But if anyone knows you know yourself
Can I come close enough to rescue me
I'm pretty sure what the colour will be
Will I stay sane will I be framed
Will I look cool will I be ashamed
Nightfall dark or morning bright
I think I'll choose the colour of night
I paint me a picture with depressive strokes
Selfportrayed in indigo
I paint me a picture with depressive strokes so bold
Selfportrayed in indigo
Grey's the skin  hanging eyes
Sick and thin  not so nice
Uncut nails  hair has died
Stressed and frail  I look so tired
Here you are discolouration
Can't believe that this is me
A bum and freak abomination
Forget about all vanity
Canvas tales of seven sins
The fucking face of an evil twin
I look like horror look like fear
Like I haven't slept for a hundred years
When I die  when I am dead
Bury me  when life has fled
In return  I give to you
A little gift  of black and blue
Sing a song  party on
Have one on me  drink and breathe
In the days  that will pass
Remember me  who I was
We're on the road to hell
Down without brakes
Betrayal and cheaper lies
Whatever it takes
I play my evil games
And you you play yours
A conspiring and spying witch
To win the cold war
Evil I do Evil you see
My feelings are true
And more evil you will be
I burned down your soul
I killed all your needs
I hate all your flaws
But more evil you're to me
Together we reach the darkness
Too close to evil
Your hatred was vast and black
More evil than evil
You took me to hell and back
A nice little trip
Then showed me a soul to rip
Apart bit by bit
Evil I do Evil you see
My feelings are true
And more evil you will be
I burned down your soul
I killed all your needs
I hate all your flaws
But more evil you're to me
Big is the empty
A very special place
Where nothing happens
In the milky haze
There is no action
And no ones here
A whole lot of emptiness
Fills my sacred sphere
Don't say I exist
Don't say that I preach
I cannot be reached
In this state of blissI hear the ravens calling to you
Oh soulless creature violent death
Scapegoated blame laid upon me
I'll be damned to take what's left
The root of the problem
Has been buried too deep
By the time you get to it
Problems will have surpassed the end
Dig them up
Or let the pendulum swing
I put my hand to your heart
And let the bullet burn your blood
You seem to me death incarnate
Raper of life killer of love
There is no choice
Crash into mirrors
Visions in the pieces
Comprise a whole picture
Energy is cheating
Insomnia for months
There is no choice
Cannot count fingers
Multitude of memories
Left in a stupor
Sobriety out of boredom
Insomnia for months
Structure was never solid
I built it earthworn
As these old days rust
And new ones come
It's said and done
As these days fade away
And new ones sway
It's all been done
Falling towards gravity's end
As these days stay still
And some of them kill
It's said and done
This new dawn is callous
This time is not for us
Bring forth forever silent tongues
End of day wake of dawn
This time it's not calling
Our numbers they are falling
Bring forth forever silent tongues
Seeds of scorn are planted
Tribulations are hanging
Humiliation congeals
Minutes stutter unknown awareness
Nonviolence that is nefarious
Forbidden hunger age is hunting
Inhumane encounters
Minutes stutter unknown awareness
This time we are certain
A cloud draws color running red
I'll bury my hands in black water
Undercover where they've bled
Oh reconcile these actions
In tune and unaware
Where is my matchmaker
Tell me how you live your life
Cold cool flesh killing night
Without warm light becoming nothing
I watch the falling embers beckon
Come inside come to me
Unaware of this growing tension
The stillness quips at your retreat
Where is my matchmaker
Tell me how you live your life
Cold cool flesh killing night
Without warm light becoming nothing
Oh reconcile these actions
Covet it's murk and bleak relief
Casting fuel into the fire
In it we find the truth we seek
Streets lined with blood
Sleep no longer rests
Try to tune it out
This is no love generation
This is the town I live in
It is an American tension
Nature's predators live through death
Your neighbor killed big brother
Dim away the world
Whitewashed away
Waking symbols rest
Human interest repressed
We are not victims
We are someone's enemy
We all have to blame someone
Because fault is never personal
This is the town I live in
It is an American tension
Nature's predators live through death
Your neighbor killed big brother
Immersed in confusion
Drag out this unwillingly
This soundwave is paused
Uneducated adornment
Agenda of truth
It is a lie
There is none
Fact or fiction
In between
We want to build
An explanation of contradiction
Spinning wheels
Unwelcome home
Do not smile
It's not prescribed
Momentary hallucination
Well adjusted
The new insane
Locked into moments seen through and through
Like darkness shining on you revealing and weeping
I try to
Try to see things through and through
As darkness cloaks the sun I seem the only one
Brick anchors in wet sand
Carry through tomorrow's end
Lines of life carving hands
Clear the patch claim the land
Years of thought trapped inside
An unstable judgement
Perception of severity
Insidious eye
Without sight
Crossing wires
Perception of severity
We are together never alone
Some other time
Place my hand unto you
Feel no shame
Hover and suffer
Over one
Lost ending soul
One reason to fall
Is to rise
Break down break down
One false move
Everything changes
No second chance
Thought not to walk alone here
Where all things die
Witness the sameness of will
Where all men cry
Farther and farther away
Into long ago
Soft yellow halo inside
Keeps me alive
My own reflection subsides
When I look to you
Written and noted by none
Fade out into
I drift farther away
Into long ago
Witness your hollowing eyes
Find time to die
Long ago
Fade too slow
Fall to life
Motion goAn eye for an eye a heart for a heart
That's the way that we play
Up in the cloud where's angels fly
You take my breath away
Your love is my heaven
Now I'm going that way hey hey
And when I get there
You know I'm gonna stay stay stay
You're the dream of a lifetime
Whoa yeah
You're the dream of a lifetime
Yes you are
Caught up in the roles that we play
It's foolish game
There's nothing we can't do or be
If we want it the same
If I had all my chances
To look you away hey hey
Now when I find ya
you know I'm gonna stay stay stay
You're the dream of a lifetime
Whoa yeah
You're the dream of a lifetime
Yes you are
You're taking our words
You turn them inside out
You're stealing our words
For something to write about
It's a secret joke to you
To twist the facts all upside down
Front page fallacy
It's time you hear from me yeah
We're gonna turn you  inside out
You'll twist and turn  inside out
It's time you learn  inside out
Fear for your integrity
You can't hear
What we're trying to say
We're not marionettes
It's our turn to play
Sitting on your throne of greed
Trying to take our thoughts away away
Stand up for the cause
Cause we're all here to stay yeah
Inside out inside out
Now it's a secret joke to you
To twist the facts around around around
Front page fallacy
It's time you hear from me
We're gonna turn you  inside out
Turn you around  inside out
It ain't like it sounds  inside out
I'm the one who speaks for me
We're gonna turn you  inside out
You'll twist and turn  inside out
That is why I sing this song
I know I'm right and you are wrong
Inside out 
One winter night hear the call
Look through her burning eyes
He saw her face a distorted blur
Like a dream that never lies
Fade away to black
Never Never coming back
She's a Shadow in his mind
She's a Love he'll never find
Haunting scenes causing you pain
Making you realize
Climbing the walls going insane
Never to see her eyes
She's a vision in the night
She's a diamond in the firelight of love
She's a vision in the night
She's a memory of a clouded mind
She's a vision of love
One winter night she held his hand
Making him lose his mind
He turned around nowhere to be found
He knew he'd never find her
Light the fire of love tonight
You know I've always had you in my sights
But I finally have the chance to love you
So picture perfect in the light of the stars
Played so close but I want so far
Got struck by the poison of Cupid's arrow
But tomorrow comes the sorrow
Like a story book
It only took one look
'cause last night it seemed
Like things were picture perfect
Want your sudden love every night
I dreamed you'd be got to love you right
But I find it so hard to even approach you
As the stars find your lovely smile
Your fangs like devil were sharply filed
Got to question about your reputation
No longer love you like the way I did
I'll never be a fool like that again
It only took one night
To prove your precious point
Did you think that we could just be friends
Yeah yeah yeah picture perfect
Hey hey hey picture perfect
Last night it seemed
Like things were picture perfect
A long time ago
Like a fool I thought I could love you
The more that I tried
The more that you lied I believed in you
You say you can get
Any man that you want
But keeping one's a different story
The more that you get
The more that you want
The more that you get
The more that you want
And I'm the one to give you some
You break my heart
Just feed on the tears that I'm crying
When we make love
It's all we can do but you're lying
Oh yeah you say you can get
Any man that you want
But holding on's a different story
The more that you get
The more that you want
The more that you get
The more that you take
It's time that I steal your heart away
The more that you get
The more that you want
The more that you get
The more that you get
The more that you take
The more that you want
Down and out like a fox on the run
My baby's gone now I'm the lonely one
On top of that it looks like I'm going bald
My friends are two faced and my moneys gone
I got a ticket when my car broke down
A rainy day now what else could go wrong
Now who's the judge
Whats my crime
Ain't no sentence but I'm still doing time
Cause Misery
Misery Loves Company
Cause Misery Misery
Misery Loves Company
Cold and hungry like a dog in the street
I get a raw deal everyone I meet
All I want is some loving and a little respect thats all
The poor get nothing while the rich get fat
Start living good the IRS takes that
I kinda wonder if theres really any good at all at all
So whats it like
To have a smile
Id like to have one but its not my style
Nobody knows when there's cloud in the skies
When there are tears in your eyes
Nobody knows when you're hurting so bad
So if they had 
Far away where the hills turn to plains
I sit and I wonder where you are
I dream at night of the memories that we share
I feel your touch I see your stare
Nobody knows when you're down and out
Nobody cares what it's all about
When it comes to you babe
You know I'll always be there
It just seems
Nobody knows when you're down and out
Silent words a whispered song
Will you still love me when I'm gone 
Now nobody knows what you really matters
Only fools who don't belong
Nobody knows when you're down and out
Nobody cares what it's all about
When it comes to you babe
You know I'll always be there
It just seems
Nobody knows when you're down and out
And in my dreams it never seems that
Nobody knows
The hammer falls under the neon skies
The city lights reflecting in my eyes
Roll the dice a turn of the wheel
Its my turn to call
If it weren't for hard luck
Id have no luck at all
Hard lucks got a hold on me
I bet against the odds
Hard lucks coming down on me
Its in the fall of the cards
Hard luck
The nights my savior she keeps me in the dark
A bad shot it seems Ive missed the mark
Like salt in my wounds
It burns me up inside
Nowhere to run to now
Nowhere to hide
I got some hard luck
It's comin' down to hard luck
All I got is hard luck
Yeah
Somewhere in my mind
Is the fear of growing old
Deep inside my heart
The warmth has turned to cold
My tired eyes slipping away
Tired life
Waiting in the dark
To take his shot at me
Father time's a cruel man
Will I resurrect
Or will I even know
Sorrow is the master plan
Lie in bed at night
Will there be another day
Body aches in pain
Things they don't seem quite the same
Nobody cares No one to share
Tired life
Waiting in the dark
To take his shot at me
Father time's a cruel man
Will I resurrect
Or will I even know
Sorrow is the master plan
Too late  for crawling on your knees
Too late  too late to beg me please
Forget the things you said to me
No way  to ever change my mind
No way  no way to find the time
To change the feelings we once shared
Now I'm laughing in your face
I'm laughing I'm laughing in your face
Too bad  I found my pot of gold
Too bad  too bad you're getting much too old
To play your silly games with me
Look now  at who believes in who
See how  the tables turned on you
Let's see who's smiling now
Now I'm laughing in your face
I'm laughing I'm laughing in your face
And now I'm on the rebound
And I've found my own space
You're feeling rotten and forgotten
While I'm laughing in your face
And now I'm on the rebound
And I've found my own space
You're feeling rotten and forgotten
While I'm laughing in your face
In your face
I'm laughing I'm laughing in your face
I'm laughing I'm laughing
I'm laughing I'm laughing in your face
Laughing in your face
File driver detects
Thoughts of the sinister son
His velvet tongue is black
Black as the lies
I accuse him of murder
By noon he will die
Surgical death logical fear
Cult of denial
Marked souls now impaled
They only stab from behind
Virtual tribes proclaim
War to the world
Defending the inhuman
A pact from above
Surgical death logical fear
Cult of denial

Act of arson trapped inside
Deed of pyromania
Act of arson skies ablaze
Naked bodies licked by the flames
Crematorium time to die
Total mayhem none survived
Feel the smell of human steaks
Bones and blackened skin and ash
Demoralized the world tonight like one with the dust
Struck by temptation to steal the light
The flaming dice will roll tonight no chance to adjust
It's the inferno of one man's rite
Fire starter incubates
Man of madness pervert faith
Fire starter masturbate
With erection celebrates
Institutions feed his mouth
Better off lobotomized
Save your money stop to fake
Here's the verdict exterminate
Demoralized the world tonight like one with the dust
Struck by temptation to steal the light
The flaming dice will roll tonight no chance to adjust
It's the inferno of one man's rite
Demoralized the world tonight like one with the dust
Struck by temptation to steal the light
The flaming dice will roll tonight no chance to adjust
It's the inferno of one man's rite
From above it's falling down
Chilling me a punisher of lies
In my head a photograph
I see clear now I don't need them
And still the rocks will roll
But why don't I
Another hopeless goal
Take it back
Offered me a pot of gold
Here you are your entrance from the cold
Paradise can turn to Hell
Stop to preach 'cause I don't know you
But still the rocks will roll
So how could I
Another heartless soul
Take it back
Now the deal once made is gone
Waking up the dead of my life
And still the rocks will roll
But why don't I
Another hopeless goal
But still the rocks will roll
So how could I
Another heartless soul
Take it back
Lost generations detectors of technical steel
Surrounded by serpents imprisoned by spinning the wheel
Divided disciples chaotic machines virtualized
Now resurrected conducting the start of their rise
Clones of fate

Absurd and outrageous but sharp like the edge of a knife

Steal the eye from the blind
In the last temptation of the sky
They have burned the bridges of forever
Now as I wonder why
Shadows of tomorrow pass me by
Will I ever walk among the strangers
Someone whispered my name
Someone cried out in shame
Another sleepless night
Life on the edge of the razor
No place for the sacrificed
Minds ride escape the erasure
A travel in time
Take the fire from the flame
In the final raging of the rain
Look around the pagan of desire
No one asked me my name
No one suffered my pain
The desert of my heart
Life on the edge of the razor
No place for the sacrificed
Minds ride escape the erasure
A travel in time
Life on the edge of the razor
No place for the sacrificed
Minds ride escape the erasure
A travel in time
Life on the edge of the razor
No place for the sacrificed
Minds ride escape the erasure

Balance of insanity
Union behind bars
Reunited scenery
Now show us where you are
Revolution mind intrusion
Antidote of war
Army's multiplicity
The prize of life will soar
It's all too late atomic slave
It's all too late toxication rave
Serpent in euphoria
Brainwashed drained and gone
Hide behind polluted clouds
The chaos has begun
Mass confusion no solution
Interstate disease
Failure of conformity
Scrub my bleeding knees
It's all too late atomic slave
It's all too late toxication rave
Pay the fee too your life
Welcome to ecstasy
Permission to try
Now pay the ticket to life
Goodbye to courtesy
We do or we die
Balance of insanity
Union behind bars
Reunited scenery
Now show us where you are
Mass Confusion no solution
Antidote of war
Failure of conformity
The price of life will soar
It's all too late atomic slave
It's all too late toxication rave
Now as the rope's getting tighter
Now as the envy is here
Where are the drugs to determinate the fear
Raped by the senses inside you
Taken by people who hate
Backyard of life or reflections of your state
High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking
Come to the circus infernal
Come to a market of hounds
Just place a bid human cattle all around
Needles injecting your body
Needles to stick through your flesh
Buyers of death will you pass their final test
High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking
High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking
High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking
High profit collide
Slave hunting time
Trail of trafficking
Here now burning ambition
Scenes from the highway reborn in a strange land
I am the ultimate killer time is on my side
I drift 'cross America
I walk on bloodstained soil
Nightmares to arrive
Embrace your fear my love
Your eyes see no compassion
No one can tame what's unleashed here inside me
Road kill now my redemption death is salvation
I drift 'cross America
I walk on bloodstained soil
Nightmares to arrive
Erasing lives my sun
I drift 'cross America
I walk on bloodstained soil
Nightmares to arrive
Embrace your fear my love
A chaser of delight
A jewel of the night
Danger games of mine
Now tell me is it far
Memories for me they are
Glaciers of my mind
Soultaker
Soultaker
Prepare to meet your maker
Soultaker
Life has turned to hell
I'm dying for your trust
Glory and lust
Rape me one more time
Enthroned by my desire
Selfish a denial
The psychic sea dried up

I got a knife in my locker
I got a gun that is mine
I am a boy on a mission
I don't know why but you'll die
Hatred's my fuel
Hiding in the shadows
Violence my tool
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuel
Cursed by the fools
Hiding in the shadows
I make the rules
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuel
Why do you sigh after others
Why would they cry over you
Why do you hate my desire
Why is my time running out
Hatred's my fuel
Hiding in the shadows
Violence my tool
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuel
Cursed by the fools
Hiding in the shadows
I make the rules
Hatred's my fuel
Hiding in the shadows
Violence my tool
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuel
Cursed by the fools
Hiding in the shadows
I make the rules
Bleeding but the hatred's my fuelI thought i knew you so well
I thought i knew you but you were a liar
Empty words without truth
Someone came along believed
You blew wind
In your sails so there's no
Justice after all
Can't you see you're wrong
Sins of a father
This time you can't get out of it
Sins of a father
Feels like i'm under a spell
Feels like i'm under a spell and i'm falling
Shattered by the things that i've learned
It's time to stand up
Straight realize repent
All you've done and be forgiven
By your son
Can't you see you're wrong
Desert wind blowing hard seeking
Shelter ry to hide
On the run got to make it blinded
By the dust
That that fills my eyes
On the move wihout water defying
The demon star
How long can i take it how far
Can i go
Feel so alone now as the time's
Gone by
I can't believe you're gone
As i ride through the storm
Running for my life i see no end
To it all
They took her life as they
Stabbed her through the heart
And that was yesterday now i'm on
The run in arabia
They stole my soul in the middle
Of the night
I've got to find a way out of
This nightmare in arabia
Nights are cold days are warm out
Here in this wasteland
Running around 'round in circles
Lost in the dunes of neverland
I've got to drink i need water or
Else i will surely die
How long can i take this how far
Can i go
In my dreams you're always there
I'm here all alone i see your face
I stand before you the one you
Search for
Called out my name within your
Dream
Standing before you i'm the
Saviour i'm the key
You're locked inside and can't
Get out
I'm here to help you
There is nothing you can do
You're the victim you're the fool
Caught in a nightmare
Nowhere you can run
But you will never be alone
I am the scarecrow
In your field of dreams
I'm here to protect you
You've got to believe or else
You'll fall
Deeper within inside yourself
Stand up and fight it
There's no time for second thoughts
And if you want to break free
I'm here to help you
There is something you can do
you're no victim you're no fool
caught in a nightmare
time to make a turn
and you will never be alone
I am the scarecrow
in your field of dreams
i'm here to protect you
just like a scarecrow
here inside your dream
and i will protect you
Reach for the sky pray to god you
will not die
and there is no reason for you to cry
listen up stay cool don't take me
for a fool
'cuz if you don't you'll soon no why
I'm your darkest dream come true
i'll fulfill your destiny
if you won't play by my rules
i'll take your life if you stand
in my way
I move in the shadows like a
spider in it's web
looking for my prey strike as the
time is right
in the streets at nightwell
proected from the light
i take what i want and i steal
anything that i like
Reach for the sky pray to god you
will not die
listen up stay cool don't take me
for a fool
'cuz if you don't you'll soon no why
Oh hear my warning and listen up
open your eyes and begin to see
an evil spirit has risen
an angel of death that brings
misery
He's taking hold of us all
he's gonna make us fall
Sooner than you'll realize
who can you criticize
judgment day's closing in
have you confessed all your sins
In disguise playing he fool
but step by step he's taking control
Sooner than you'll realize
who can you criticize
judgment day's closin in
when did it all begin
sooner than you realize
who can you criticize
judgment day's closing in
have you confessed all your sins
Lost in the faces part of the
street half empty pockets
and draggin your feet
the man with the answersgives
you a rise
half way to heaven you don't ask
the price
Now you have what it takes to be famous
you're wiser
you know the road that you're taking
a little more to get you started
halfway through the sea your parted
you're breathingbelieving
Nothing's free he's got
youthrough the veil of sadness
nothing's free and put you on thr
road to madnes
no deal opened up the big decision
nothing's free and it has put you in a prison
can you pay the jailer
A wonderful servant yours to command
grows to be master your life in his hand
a beatiful loverthen the divorce
coming down fastereach landing gets worse
The night was cold and damp
a chill in the air
a vision from the past or were
you really there
the shadows made me see
unclear hake with fear
i was paralyzed i felt hypnotized
by your stare
The ghostly sound of silence not
a single breeze
your face appeared before me it
made me freeze
my heart was beating doubletime
out of line
was it just a dream or could it
be i was loosing my mind
Someone out there
the window i saw through
could i believe it
the face i saw was you
There was a point in time when we
had been so close
now there is nothing left what we
share is gone
please leave me alone
In my loneliness you're haunting me
i just can't take it not anymore
i'm in deep distress please set me free
i just can't take it oh no more
As quickly as you appeared you
faded out
you left me trembling cold
i wanted to shout
loved you once i can't do it
again i'm going insane
if i could turn back time maybe
you still could be mine
When i think of the times
that i wished that i could have
been you
was i really frightened 
never turned a hair playing the
field like a king
you were a diamond in a coalmine
were you just living out that song
and whose fault thaat you got it all wrong
so falls the sungod as you were
Taking on the world
somehow the world just knocked
you over
taking on the world
we thought you were flying you
were really
dying goodbye
It's so hard to go up to a friend
when defences are down
wheen he is a rival
were you just too proud
to show us what we couldn't see
only survival and a lifeline
you could have used a helping hand
you could havegiven me one chance to listen
so falls the sungod as you were
Do you know you're grown up
when you know you know nothing at all
starting out from zero
when you've watched your friend
falling apart from inside
you saw a hero not a falling angel
if looks could kill you'd kill on sight
when all the time you were
freezing in sunlight
so falls the sungod as you were
Surrounded by silence pictures
within my mind
standing on the linestanding on
the borderline
to insanity
I hear the sound of my heart
drowning all my thoughts and i
can't see
things clear anymore
i hear the sound of my heart
clouding my mind
Searching for answersout of control
tell me what's gone wrong
searching for a sign 'cuz i'm
loosing control
feel i'm letting go
Lost in a time and place can't
seem to comprehend
where can i find where can i find
the answers
for the questions i have
I hear the sound of my heart
world is spinning around and
i feel so alone
i hear the sound of my heart
standing at the crossroads
don't you know i'mA cascade of lightning startles the firmament
A thousand black hooves clatter
Upon the mountain
Grey plume of dust
Red flag of blood
Blue shining blade of sky
Spark with no cause
Wound with no sword
Fresh skulls and supple bones
Golden helm of radiance
The incantation uttered by no one
The call to arms from nowhere
The message from the clarion
Resounded across deaf hills
Men awoke
And sprayed their blood upon the earth
Spark with no cause
Wound with no sword
Unseeing eye
Blood mixed with blood
O sail of skin tumbling in the air
Blowing anywhere
O absent law
Chattering useless teeth
Secreting quiet sweat
Mysterium
Mysterium
Mysterium
O mirror that does not reflect
O fire that illuminates nothing
But itself
O shadow of what never was
But seems to have been
And to have been lost
Mysterium
Mysterium
Mysterium
And the yoke weighed heavily
Upon the neck
And the tractors placed their tracks
Upon the cowering soil
The arrow cast
The bow pulled back
The arrow cast
And the chains were linked to other chains
Forged obliquely freeing no one and everyone
Ecstatic rite
Divide the father
Ecstatic rite
Divide the father
From river to sea
The waves sing and shine
Untrained unrestrained
Desiring nothing
From hill to vale
Form gives way to form
The steam shall give birth to a glacier
The heath shall give way to sand
Bone shall become tusk
Hair shall become nail
Tooth shall cling to skull
Being shall become
The eternal return
Of fire
Asphault shall flow like water
Forest shall crowd out the worms
Nothing ever began
There was no dawn
The heat chars
The cold stabs
The wheat shall give way to chaff
Bone shall crack against bone
Being shall become
The eternal return
Of fire
False horizon
Pointing nowhere
The sky is not blue
The air is not crisp
Brother sister
Tear through the forest
Brother sister
Tear through the forest
The sun doesn't set
Its bronze rays do not
Sparkle in the water
They do not brush against my lashes
As I stare
Like a statue
In vain the ironwrought tower
Pierces heaven's dome
In vain the muscle tears it's fiber
Ten more fibers blossom in its place
They tried to plant a flag
Behind the void
In vain the moat surrounds the castle
Mud skulks across its bed
In vain contraction
In vain expansion
In vain our kinds seeks total order
There is a fissure at the heart of being
They tried to plant a flag
Behind the void
I force through the opening
I claw through veil after veil
Absent purity
Painted dawn
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
I choke the apocalyptic trumpet
With my power
Resounding though the arcangel
Like marrow
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
Absent purity
Painted dawn
The future is nowhere
The past is gone
Renihilation
Renihilation
Renihilation
RenihilationOut of the corner of my eye
The hand full of life
Abandon what you lie
But never live to die
One love one life
You better look to find
One love one life
I call on you I'm gonna travel
To the end of the night
One love one life
I'll start anew I'm gonna travel
To the end of the light
One love one life
I call it one love one life
Call it one love one life
You're low and down with life
I long to see you shine
I'll wave to you my life
A sense of time and pride
One love one life
You better look to find
One love one life
I call on you I'm gonna travel
To the end of the night
One love one life
I'll start anew I'm gonna travel
To the end of the light
One love one life
I call it one love one life
I call it one love one life
Call it one love one life
One love one life
One love one life
I call on you I'm gonna travel
To the end of the night
One love one life
I'll start anew I'm gonna travel
To the end of the light
One love one life
I call it one love one life
I call it one love one life
Call it one love one life
Out of the corner of my eye
The hand full of life
Abandon what you lie

All I do is starring at the door
Like a little child I clean to miracles
That will never come true
'Cos you've gone forever
Another day without your smile
This empty space you left behind
I wish I could forget you
with every bit part of my life
I've never thought that left
can hurt so much
that I couldn't  you go
But it seems I see you everywhere I go where I go
I've confused I'm feeling in complete now
That you take away a part of me
Oh I've tried to fight that feelings
Oh no no no
Just as ever let's be
Another day without your smile
This empty space you left behind
I wish I could forget you
with every bit part of my life
Another day without your smile
This empty space you left behind
I wish I could forget you
with every bit part of my life
Why did you go Why did you go
Why did you leave me Why did you leave me
Oh please come home Oh please come home
I can't survive
I won't survive
without you
I can't survive without youIn this mask engraved I'm under a masquerade of thunder
Callling out you wonder who I am
I can hear you screaming to the bells I'm ringing
Pardon me you're dreaming I'm your nightmare's end
I'm a lost child facing a confrontation
I'm just a figment of your imagination
I'm a snake in the grass offering temptation
I'm the master of disguise
I can see you watching from the corner of my eyes
I'm the master of disguise
I'm dressed to kill tonight
In a blaze of glory I'm another story told
In a schizophrenic scene
I'm a mad creation dressed in black mutation
I'm every mother's dream
I'm a lost child facing a confrontation
I'm just a figment of your imagination
I'm a snake in the grass offering temptation
I'm the living image cast a shadow blackened passed
The mirror of our lies
In this theatre of cruelty obscurely under wraps
The curtain will arise
I'm the master of disguise
I can see you watching from the corner of my eyes
I'm the master of disguise
I'm dressed to kill tonight
I'm the master of disguise
I'm the wolf in a pack of lies
I'm the master of disguise
My eyes see inside myself
Look away look away look away
The sky is black and so is my heart
I'm afraid I am pain I am death
I'll be your fool
I am your slave
But one false move and you're blown away
Action speaks I will die for you
In the end I pretend I was cruel
You're all inside me don't try and hide me
Cause I am you and you are begging me to stay
I'll be your bad guy
I will portray
But one false move and you're blown away
I call she says
I know you're there
I can hear you breathing
It's you again
I know it's wrong
My time is gone
I can feel your touch
Right through the phone
I got your number from the TV screen
Said if you're lonely just give me a call
Cause I'm only a hotline away
We got the girls so hot and sweet
The cherry filled here your talk is cheap
We'll bring your lonely nights to life
I feel your fingers touching me
Through my line
You seem to say all the right things
In time
Love is a crime
It's stealing my soul and my mind
Love is a crime
You get what you get love is blind
Love is a crime
It's stealing my soul and my mind
Love is a love is a love is a crime
You get what you get love is blind
They say I can't love girls like you
But what do they know
Leave that trash alone
I know you're more than just a voice on the phone
Your words they leave nothing to hide
On my line
I need to hear your voice inside
My line
Love is a crime
It's stealing control of my mind
Love is a love is a love is a crime
You want and you watch you can't find
Love is a crime
Love gives on the take from behind
Love is a love is a love is a crime
Behind the line she's all mine
Love is a love is a love is a love is a crime
Love is a crime
Love is a crime
Love is a crime
Lies in the pouring rain
I taste who you are
A stranger with life to bleed
I'm bleeding you dry
Cry out the unspoken
The devil's in disguise
Life flows into my veins
From angels in your eyes
Sins of the flesh
Lust in my breath
No one must ever know
I own your soul
Tears in the sunlit sky
I know what you dream
There's one hope for you and I
I am what I seem
Cry out the unspoken
The devil's in disguise
Life flows into my veins
From angels in your eyes
Sins of the flesh
Lust in my breath
No one must ever know
I own your soul
Sins of the flesh
Innocence blessed
Trust me you're not alone
Anymore
Cry out the unspoken
The devil's in your eyes
Life flows into my veins

Trust me you're not alone Trust me you're not alone

When the moon is full
And the hounds of hell
Are howling in the night
And the church bell gives an angry yell
There's a screech of pain
Under a broken back street light
I feel her sweet pain
When there's phantoms in the night
Strangers in the night
In the darkness there
Hiding in the unlit
I know she's here I know she's here
Lovers at first sight
But I've never seen her face
She comes the stroke of midnight
To pray lay my soul to waste
She keeps calling my name
I can feel her near
She keeps calling my name
I can feel her stare
Strangers in the night
A softly whisper stare
The smell of sweet perfume
Scent in the air with lust and care
She comes for what she needs
She is my wildest dream
Sad wings against my body brush
I am her human touch
She keeps calling my name
I can feel her near
I keep hearing my name
Whispered breathless
Phantoms
Come save me a dream
Phantoms of the night
Phantoms
Come stay with me Stay with me
Phantoms of the night
She keeps calling my name
I can feel her near
I keep hearing my name
Whispered breathless
Phantoms
Come save me a dream
Phantoms of the night
Phantoms
Come stay with me Stay with me
Phantoms of the night
Phantoms
Come save me a dream Come on and save me a dream
Phantoms of the night Of the night of the night
Phantoms
Come stay with me Stay with meCome on and stay with me
Phantoms of the night
Please don't stand in my way
I can't play this game no more
I don't see things your way
And I know one thing for sure
I won't give up a little sadness
I need to fill my life with madness
Cause you're never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye
Never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye
Please don't stand in my light
I've got time to pay tonight
You know I've stayed too long
I must seize the day before the day's long gone
I won't give up a little sadness
I need to fill my life with madness
Cause you're never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye
Never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye
Say goodbye
So here I am
Don't misunderstand
So here I am
I've got no plans
But I'm alive
Cause you're never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye
Never too young to die To die
Never too young to say goodbye To say goodbye
Cause you're never too young to die
Never too young to say goodbye To say goodbye
Never too young to die To die
Never too young to say goodbye To say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye
We sleep at day we feed at night
We catch the flight
We taste the wine and life's a scream
And love's a bite
Silence breaks through the air
Eyes of flame burn my stare
Can't resist it's way too strong
Come where only you belong
And be one of us
One of us come taste the wine and fly away
One of us last boys alive we die to play
One of us come taste the blood of life with me
One of us be one of us I know the way
We fear the sun worship the moon
We've come undone
We've sold ourself immortal youth
Nomads we are one
Silence breaks through the air
Eye's of flame burn my stare
Can't resist it's way too strong
Come where only you belong
And be one of us
One of us come taste the wine and fly away
One of us last boys alive we die to play
One of us come taste the blood of life with me
One of us be one of us I know the way
I could make you believe I could make you feel
I could be any one I want to be it seems so real
What do you want to see the villain is black
What do you want from me to deceive
I'll fill your eyes with broken dreams
It's a psychodrama caught in a web of mystery
Psychodrama this is the place where my eyes can
Feel the pain they inflict on me
I'm a killer at large on your movie screen
What do you want to be the hero in white
What do you want from me to believe
I'll fill your eyes with shattered schemes
It's a psychodrama caught in a web of mystery
Psychodrama there's no escape from what you see
Psychodrama trapped in my world deceptively
Psychodrama come inside with me come inside and see my world
It's a psychodrama caught in a web of mystery
Psychodrama there's no escape from what you see
Psychodrama no matter what you pretend to be
Psychodrama in the theatre of cruelty
Psychodrama you'll lose your mind insanity
Psychodrama in this land of obscurity
There's hope in he night
When eyes are ablaze
They've turned out the lights
On my way through the maze
I sold you a vision
But I sold out too cheap
And I'll never know which way do I go
Oh I'm in too deep
Tragically I wonder always underground
I'm waiting in the wings
I'm watching for a way to make it out
I'm waiting for the wings
Take a chance you'll believe in me somehow
I see things clearly now
Time has changed me
I am a creation now is that a strange thing
I know that you need me oh I'm waiting I'm waiting
Nothing's the same not even my name
Oh this whole thing's been staged
Magically I'll appear without a sound
Somehow we'll make it through
We got nothing to lose
Just take a chance
In this theatre of cruelty
I'm the living page of mystery
No turning back I'm inside your head
Time to roll over and play dead
Cut to the chase scene the hero's amazing
Degenerate millionare filthy rich crazy
Sinners and cowards and hypocrites creedless
Powerless lost double crossed
Here to eat us alive
We can survive they can't make us they won't break our stride
We can survive never lay down and die
Roll over roll over
Roll over and play dead I said
Roll over roll over
Roll over and play dead
Sluts are your lovers the streets are their haven
Their dreams all died hard when their pumps hit the pavement
Comas and golddust and promises promises
Whitecoats and cutthroats they lied
No place to hide
We can survive we can fake it they can't take our pride
we can survive never lay down and die
Roll over roll over
Roll over and play dead
Roll over roll over
Roll over and play dead
Under the rose you pass me by
It only goes to show I'm a visual lie
You know that's how it goes
Under the rose
Standing in the shadows behind the scenes
Understudy zero you never noticed me
And I know you can't hear me
Yeah you know that's how it goes
Under the rose
Well the villain is the hero and I'm torn dirty and mod
I've gone from scorn to sensation cause I'm great at being bad
I got the world in the palm of my hand
I break out the beast and make 'em understand
Never turn it down shout it out loud
And I'm feeling strong I can take it
Yeah I'm feeling strong we can make it through
So turn it on we got the power
Turn it up we got the power
We own the night if you follow my lead
Hide in plain sight we'll make the suckers bleed
Never turn it down shout it out loud
And I'm feeling strong I can take it
Yeah I'm feeling strong we can make it through
So turn it on
We got the power
Turn it up we got the powerHelp me sort my anger
You decide which battles to fight
You're my helper
You're my keeper
There's a thin line 
You must never ever cross
When you get there
I will tell you
Not to treat where you do not belong
You do not cross my path
Or you will face my wrath
Do not belittle me
Or I will crush your cranium
There is no diagnosis deep enough to cover what is wrong with me
Come show me the side of your truth
The bitterness makes me blind
Lead me towards my inner self
To see what's hidden inside
Sentiment
What's my story
Sentiment
Where's my glory
Great divide
The canyon between us all
So deep inside
It's rooted inside our soul
Now and then and forever
In our hearts
In our hearts
In our hearts
Gimme shelter
Gimme weapons
Gimme all your money
And your soul as well
I will keep you
I will kill you
I will torture you beyond what's possible
You opened up the door
To evil uncontrolled
So little you can do to stop this flood of violent art
My brother save yourself
From this malevolence
To analyze this shit is far beyond your capacity
Come show me the side of your truth
The bitterness makes me blind
Lead me towards my inner self
To see what's hidden inside
Sentiment
What's my story
Sentiment
Where's my glory
Great divide
The canyon between us all
So deep inside
It's rooted inside our soul
Now and then and forever
In our hearts
In our hearts
In our hearts
End this sentiment
All the work will make it worth it
End this sentiment
No collapse will ever be worth it
Facing defeat after defeat
Sacred hopes vanished in haze
But with your mother we stood as one
It didn't kill us it made us strong
We walked through hell but we came back
An iron faith leading our heart
Nothing could destroy this will
And we fought 'til victory
Welcome Vikroria you are my flesh you are my blood
Welcome Viktoria angel of light you are my pride
Welcome Viktoria you are my flesh you are my blood
Welcome Viktoria angel of light you changed my life
The hallowed day of your birth
The fight seemed lightyears away
In the moment you saw the light
the darkened spell was slain
Now I feel like a wolf
I'm the guardian of the pack
No one shall do you harm
I'd kill the one who'd mistreat you
Storming the gates to purgatory we are riding the storm
Raise your fist in victory we hail the blazon stone we march on
A whole life branded by tunes of steel
It's in my heart and in my blood eternally
Hail to the free hooray to the wild
Gave me force faith and pride
Glorious and legendary tales
Branded the whole metal age
We are branded and exiled prisoners of our time
The brotherhood's our guardian we are rebels at heart  'til we die
The big brother I never had at my side
Through the dark and in the light guiding my life
Hail to the free
Chains and leather it's metal 'til death they call us renegades
Dorkas can't tame libertalia the heart of the wild and free
Hail to the free
Forever in our hearts
Legacy of the wild
Forever in our hearts
Legacy of the wild
Blackest heart diabolic souls
Their tongues spit venom and evil
Insane fools spread the blood
of innocence  flowing gore
They want women to be their slaves
And religion to rule the law
A return to middle ages
Where democracy is unknown
The dark crusade  servants of hell
The dark crusade  heirs to the damned
The jihad  we'll fight it back
We're no slaves to religion
Worst liars  manipulation
In fact they spit on the Koran
They want a world where freedom dies
Where religion is policy
A return to darkest days
We left since centuries
Listen brothers the war is won
The oppression has been slayed down
We took the sword for a noble cause
Hail and glory to our fallen ones
We've seen their empire fall we've seen the tyrants crawl
Our freedom was born through our blood our faith was our force
Hold your banners high
Proud towards the sky
We hail pagan glory
We hail victory
Hail
Greet the sunrise for it reveals
A new age where man is free
To trust and pray whom he wants
No iron fist to rule the law
There's no god below a cross sealed above wood and stone
He's everywhere and in each believer's heart no murder tears faith apart
Out of the dark origins not well known
Sacred heart for the cross we honour
Mighty and great warriors ready to spill the blood
For the heretic ones have to die a new age is now to rise
Through the holy fire
By the holy steel
Through the holy trial
The age of the warrior priest
Then we returned into myths of time
Thousand secrets  forever left behind
Our legend still lives on mixing true and false
About our lives our gold our realm and how we died
We are rooted in the underground  to metal we're bound
We've sworn the oath and honour it's way the cult of steel we hail
Gift from the gods precious and pure a force to guide our rules
We are the masters we are the slaves following our aim
Slaves of steel
Slaves to metal
Slaves of steel
The wolf division
No mainstream crap but true and raw  the way how should sound metal
The underground breed of legions preaching the iron
We are together all as one to defend our gold
No one will ever make us change  fight for the metal reign
The coastal raid on holy island
A new age baptized in blood
The monastery of lindisfarne is in flames
Death came from far far north
Heathen hearts viking hordes
Bloodbath in the temple of god they crushed the cross
Heathen horde
Pagan fire on holy ground
The slaughter of Northumbria
Foretold the viking age
Conquerors with heathen beliefs and faith
Pagan hearts praise values and honour
Spit on the cross and holy evil
The legacy in the hearts of the free today
Too weak to fight against god's servants
Women that wants to live or witches of Salem
They are innocent
The burning stakes of holy lies
You you can't decide
You have no right
To torture and kill in the god's name
Do it and you will never hide
The truth will find you you will be cursed
Words of the witch like the storm
Listen to them They will curse you
Words of the witch like the flame
Will burn your soul will kill you
Consecrated ground will not host their bones
People fear the holy priests
No one will help them on the gallows hill
And again way too young to die
Words of William Stoughton
You Giles Corey
You will be pressed
To death by stone
Bridget Bishop
 guilty to death
Martha Corey
Satan's daughter
you will die too
The snow covers Bavaria
Giving a mystic aura
To the cemetery I enter
Headstones rise through the snow
Like soulkeepers in the fog
Seem to prevail your rest below
Farewell farewell dear old man
I cannot believe this was the end
I like to believe you're roaming around
Close to her first steps watching her proud
I don't know if there's god above
But I know you entered the great hall
Having an eye on all our beloved ones
I'm sad she'll never meet you
In her blood is a part of you
The scythe of time felt much too soon
Black crows picking up the flesh
From dead bodies lying all around
No descent burial place here
Their mortuary drape is the fog
Flesh is sacred cannibals roam
The instinct to survive
Caves are the new homes
Technology's far behind
Choirs of the damned echo in the dark
Like Armageddon's lullaby
Souls of black sent a mark
And doomed the world to die
The red button's down
Now it happened finally
This insane world is laid waste
Destruction is complete
Survivors creep through ruins
Gazing at chaos complaints and death
Rulers achieved the prophecy
Foretold since thousand of years
No more colors darkness reigns in the sky
The judgement day of a race doomed to die
First came a fireflash
Then ashes obscured the sky
Fires burned the whole cities down
And the ground reveals a no man's land
The hour zero
First came a fireflash
Then ashes obscured the sky
Fires burned the whole cities down
And the ground reveals a no man's land
The hour zero
United clans organize
The post holocaust
To come through the fight
The dawn of mankind
No more colors
First came a fireflash
Thousands of years
Now have passed
Unbelievable technology
Power and glory
Rule the game
Driving some bastard rulers insane
Man will never
Escape his fate
Nuclear war begins again
The order
Screamed with hate
Push the red button down  now
The red button's down
Now it happened again
Another world laid waste
Destruction is complete
The greed for glory
Deep in the heart of men
It was forever and evil will be
Damned is the legacyWith my broken legs I'll cross these miles
With my wounded chest I'll embrace you
With my frozen hands I'll warm your skin
And feed you though I am hungry
With my torn wings I'll crawl to you
With my ripped lips I'll kiss your mouth
Making me your frozen angel
Have some littel tears
To seize this darkness
Another drop of blood will promise
That we wont ever leave
These tears joy you will remember
And every kiss wont fade away
Just take me and let me bleed
Let your angel purify the way
I knew you and i know
The distance between the flames
The places to grow without
And the places that miss our names
Sometimes it feels too cold
When the flames about to sober
Insane they will be
Around you
Around you I'll be
Around you I'll be free
Take me and let me in
Inside your heart i am burning
Step by step to eleven years
Crashing past and slaying fears
By two numb souls and a rose
Torn rose for every year
And now I want you
my dark girl
11 will be the time
Of these times of mine entwined
Your face with sparks of light
These pregnant clouds of moments wont carry the burden forever
And someday the rains
Will heal us
Relive us
Atone our sins
And stop these sad melodies
Carved on my forehead are the meanings of your drippy name
And sticking on my tongue is the taste of your hidden beauty
Glorious tear in its way to touch the cold air
In its journey to reach the solid ground below my existence
Rid my wings from distance
And turn the other page
Birds with torn wings are the humans
Flying too low and crashing down
Chanters of autumns
Callers of long winters
Dismembering the wings
Trying to wash away the blood
That tainted our ancient flesh
A dawn without sun
A winter without coldness
I raise my eyes to the skies
And whisper my July
The heavens answer me
And rain blood over me
The color of night becomes crimson
And no grief on my wings
Sing from the tower of souls
And watch my spirit free
A shroud of winter appeared
i saw her eyes
Life is circles lead to you
Wild journey with no return
Five fingers are not enough
To cope it with a smile
Glance the dark in me
Just one single color black
Like my past like my love
An everlasting nightmare
So blind to see my present
So sad to make a smile
So mad to look ahead
So damned to going on
The smell of the past
Caves my bleeding lungs
To smile is to forget
And to forget is to die
Find a place for them to feel safe lock them up away from us
Beat them with fists and bats tear them down to make them ours
Their thoughts aren't what we approve of can't give them back their
rights
Our way is the right way follow us or die
Haunting aiming
Have fun with their fear
Bleeding begging
No life is to spare
Leaders of the world
Takes no chances enemies will bleed
Steals the life of the weak
Our way will conquer
Can't allow the wrong opinion won't allow for them to speak
Rips their tongues out of their mouths free in speech we don't believe
Haunting aiming
Have fun with their fear
Bleeding begging
No life is to spare
Leaders of the world
Takes no chances enemies will bleed
Steals the life of the weak
Our way will conquer
The race will be all the same everyone will be the same
Weed by choosing the right men killing the one who's left in the end
Haunting aiming
Have fun with their fear
Bleeding begging
No life is to spare
Waste allot purify my loss and regrets
Domination leads my life
Slaughtered people slayer I
Weirdest thoughts understanding is not my game
Pain blackout your eyes will bleed
Slaughtered people slayer I
Ripping open learning you
Aim to wisdom better man than you
Mending my frustrations all thoughts on myself
Takes no notice in others pain
Wasted bodies master I
My fist crushes faces spilling blood for them
Crushing dreams of future fighting is my game
Wasted bodies master I
Ripping open learning you
Aim to wisdom better man than all of you
Innocence makes progress need no cause to slay
Weak victims make no difference just easier for me
Everybody is hating me
Molesting makes me stronger I need the smell of blood
Wants to drink it from them drain them in the mud
Everybody is hating me
Ripping open learning you
Aim to wisdom better man than all of you
I've lost my mind to others lost my senses to all that's left is
instincts for me
So don't tell me I'm psycho you can't judge my deeds all I'm doing is
following my needs
My inheritance is leading me
All I'm doing is for me death duty
Forces leading me demanding all my acts no mind left to tell me wrong
You don't judge beasts for killing say it's in its genes the same
genes is running me
The smell of blood wakes all senses
Leading me in my dismemberment
The haunting still arouses me
One step closer to damnation
Getting stronger standing on my own
Rejecting weakness I am the leading soul
Making my way through permissive living the choices I make is based on
myself
All the killing is of necessity my death instinct is leading me
The number of acts is nothing
The instinct of death is everything
The haunting still arouses me
One step closer to damnation
Getting stronger standing on my own I am the leading soul
Rejecting weakness I am the leading soul
I say my life is over all seems to point that way
My senses all are dead I'm leaning for disgrace
Feeling like a corpse 
My body wasted source
Falling down to my rest
Finally I've reached what's me
I'm told my hope is no more I can't care less
I've lived my life for this day this oneday was my goal 
Final this I like
No life the end is here
Falling down to my rest
Finally I've reached what's me
Some people will hail this day the day all their hate die
Relief's from years of disdain I will reveal their luck
No more times of rage
The butcher has met his grave
Falling down to my rest
Finally I've reached what's me
When I show my skills to the world everybody is amazed
I'm the champion of the human race the winner of the race
Leading leader of the people 
Master master of the world 
King the world is my kingdom 
I own the earth 
Everybody wants to be me see the world through my eyes 
They all want to be worshipped feel the glory every day 
Leading leader of the people 
Master master of the world 
King the world is my kingdom 
I own the earth 
Kicks down on my slaves who feed me 
Murder everyone who stands up to me 
Torture is my way of leading 
Worship worship me 
Leading leader of the people 
Master master of the world 
King the world is my kingdom 
I own the earth 
Kicks down on my slaves who feed me 
Murder everyone who stands up to me 
Torture is my way of leading 
Worship worship me 
I rule my people with their fear I'm playing god for fun 
Their agony gets things done for me their pain is what I own 
Leading leader of the people 
Master master of the world 
King the world is my kingdom 
I own the earth 
Kicks down on my slaves who feed me 
Murder everyone who stands up to me 
Torture is my way of leading 
Worship worship me
Well I'm mourning now I'm hating meet my anger sorrow
I'm searching for what I need I'm using acting
My weird mind controls me
Entertains me and depresses me
Fear some scare some
It will kill some will it kill me
I'm searching for my inner understanding selfishness makes me 
Satisfied stronger I'm detestable cumbersome
Violent thoughts are cleansing
Smelling it will touch your greed
Loneliness is happiness
Best friend my self
Reach inside empty soul tear apart molest myself
Feeling strong powerful Sovereign free of choice
Reaching for my throat strangles with itself
Tearing me apart finally I'm one
Silence emptiness
Happiness restlessness
Feeling free left alone
Hating me hating none
Smell of fear comes to me
Getting aroused starts to need
Starts to hate starts to live
Will end it death will give
Hate underestimated Anger makes you focused
Begging weak revenge will feed your needs
Never think of others never compromise
Set your self at first Self seeking on your own
Tearing me apart finally I'm one
Found myself finally I'm one
I fight for my right to destroy my body I torture my body the way I feel
Needles and pills I use all I want with razors I stab myself bleeding out
Spilling my vain makes my life brighter draining my body from years of black
Anaesthetized I seem almost normal with drugs in my veins I'm stronger to all
Using using everything I got
Carving my arms to forget
Forget everything I've seen the past will be
Erased from my mind drained with chemicals
No one shall call me useless even if that is what I am
They aren't got the right to reject just because I've choose this way
Using using everything I got
Carving my arms to forget
Forget everything I've seen the past will be
Erased from my mind drained with chemicals
The day I die will be my first day and freedom is what I prepare
My chains shall be broken by poison the poison I inhale for emptiness
Using using everything I got
Carving my arms to forget
Forget everything I've seen the past will be
Erased from my mind drained with chemicals
The first time I came close to death was in the beginning of my change
The reaction of my body stroke my soul like nothing else
Senselessness mends all that's weak
The pain I felt pushed me to seek
Tortured by my past I went just deeper in my vain
Strength by what I found I couldn't wait to see the end 
The dark side of mentality
Deeper than all I have seen
Weed rest waste gone
Stab blow choke free
Reached the gate
I reign my end with possibilities of making it original
The greater I fall into sleep remembrance increase
Sacrifice of life to be 
Remembered to those left behind
Weed rest waste gone
Stab blow choke freeCONFUTATIS MALEDICTIS TRAGEDY STORMS HIM WHEN DEMONS SPARE HER LIFE AND
ALL DISCOVER SHE HAS A DEMONHEART DEMONHEART
Feeling trapped in with the slimy creatures now close to being killed
she soon revealed her forgotten sad past first to herself they smelled
her flesh ready to be devoured but something happened they moved away
seeming to be frightened sparing her life Shocked again she opened the
gates of her tragic past and bloody images came back to her mind
She remembered the old mission the dark comet's goal beyond the suns
the flight through that black hole
CONFUTATIS MALEDICTIS TRAGEDY STORMS HIM WHEN DEMONS SPARE HER LIFE AND
ALL DISCOVER SHE HAS A DEMONHEART DEMONHEART
She lived again in some frames of sorrow that evil journey planned by
the Arias' exploring section to find new worlds But all that they found
beyond their system was the black portal depths of oblivion came back to
their world once opened it Arkan and the other warriors who observed the
scene could not feel the same way now about that girl
He moved to her taking her hand running fast away from his old friends
all for her he loved her
CONFUTATIS MALEDICTIS TRAGEDY STORMS HIM WHEN DEMONS SPARE HER LIFE AND
ALL DISCOVER SHE HAS A DEMONHEART DEMONHEART
She's ready to turn off her life's flame to free all his people from
hell but no he doesn't want to accept this solution preferring to
think of how he can escape Hundreds of them are now coming friend is
now an ancient word there's no place left to hide in this white icy
dungeon no way to survive of the close shadows' fall shadows' fall
And so she made her choice seeing Arkan fooling himself with lost hopes
She left her lover's arms and crying she started to run away to
them
She looked at him praying 'forgive me' but he could not answer at
all she was gonna be killed by the mass of those riled now screaming and
trying to stop all their pain 'cause she would have been surely tortured
by all of those religion's fools he was then obliged to shoot his
princess to avoid the brutality of his now dead old friends
She was now lying there dying in a lake of ice and blood while he
embracing her was killing them with his red eyes
WHEN HER BLOOD RAN THROUGH THE DARK ICE THE SURFACE BEGAN TO TREMBLE
QUAKES AND THUNDERS CRASHING EVERYWHERE THIS IS ZAEPHYR'S TRAGIC
DOOMSDAY WHAT WAS UNREVEALED SO EVEN TO THE PROPHET OF THE LAST
ECLIPSE LAST ECLIPSE
No trace of life around What happened to his ancient town He hopes it's
not a dream but the sun is now lighting him
WHEN HER BLOOD RAN THROUGH THE DARK ICE THE SURFACE BEGAN TO TREMBLE
QUAKES AND THUNDERS CRASHING EVERYWHERE THIS IS ZAEPHYR'S TRAGIC
DOOMSDAY WHAT WAS UNREVEALED SO EVEN TO THE PROPHET OF THE LAST
ECLIPSE LAST ECLIPSE
Arkan's friends were now convinced they knew the real truth just her
sacrifice would have been real hope for the Zaephyr's salvation The old
Vaikaris so spoke these were his own words from her sad arrival he was
sure that she was hiding something
She is the portal of cosmic evil all demons live in her alien breath She
keeps the seed of the far oblivion and for all this she's condemned to
death
BLACK REALMS' MAJESTY LIGHT MY SAD DESTINY MY DEATH MAY FREE HIS WORLD
CHAOS WILL NOT USE ME ANYMORE
Arkan stopped her bitter words with a kiss so warm when she asked him to
let her die there in the embrace of that frost She could not accept the
truth She was the cause of all and knew evil now was using her as
passage for its coming
The eclipse is the sun of its newborn kingdom the demons the soldiers of
this dark war It wants to conquer the holy planet it wants to rape the
spirit of love
BLACK REALMS' MAJESTY LIGHT MY SAD DESTINY MY DEATH MAY FREE HIS WORLD
CHAOS WILL NOT USE ME ANYMORE
I will die in his name to close the portal to free my pain

En Benalúa de Guadix
un nuevo Cid Campeador
intrépido y aventurero
una frase nos dejó
La fusca sobre la barra
del puticlub en el que entró
echó el cerrojo a la puerta
¡Esta noche mando yo
Esta noche manda mi polla
Esta noche el jefe soy yo
Esta noche manda mi polla
Ponte otra ponte otra ronda mi amor
Se llevó solo un lagarto
un morao ni lo trincó
Su delito es el de todos
¡Hasta los huevos de tó
La justicia siempre ciega
con el pobre se cebó
cuatro añitos a la sombra
¡Hasta los huevos de tó
Esta noche manda mi polla
Esta noche el jefe soy yo
Esta noche manda mi polla
Ponte otra ponte otra ronda mi amor
Asesinos salen sueltos
mil corruptos indultados
Si el papa está en los billetes
impune ante los juzgados
Si en vez de un chatarrero
un rico monta el fregao
habrían cerrado el caso
y ni dios hubiese hablado
Esta noche manda mi polla
Esta noche el jefe soy yoY aquí no habla ni Dios
Y hasta los huevos de tó
Y aquí no habla ni Dios
Y hasta los huevos de tó
Y aquí no habla ni Dios
Y hasta los huevos de tó
Apenas catorce años
cuando yo lo fui a comprar
muy nervioso y excitado
no lo sabía ni usar
Una bella dependienta
sonriendo preguntó
¿Tú sabes cómo se usa
Tuve que decir que no
Así es como se utiliza
Se lo puso en su pulgar
sonreía y me miraba
no se te vaya a olvidar a olvidar
En el sexo como en todo
se te queda la lección
si te explican bien las cosas
Como mi primer condón
Esa bella dependienta
fue a la puerta y la cerró
Ya sabes la teoría
pues pasemos a la acción
Se deshace de la bata
¡Qué cuerpo madre de Dios
Se me acerca y me susurra
¡Ey tigre ponte el condón
Yo acabé en la misma gloria
ella quiso confirmar
¿Te pusiste la gomita
Mírala en mi pulgar mi pulgar
En el sexo como en todo
se te queda la lección
si te explican bien las cosas
Como mi primer condón
Si Dios todopoderoso
ha de ser tres a la vez
Yo que tengo cama grande
quiero lo mismo que él
Y si los magos de oriente
fueron tres para adorar
Unir tres cuerpos calientes
será la cifra ideal
Tres fueron los mosqueteros
Tres veces Pedro negó
Tres los cerditos del cuento
Tres siempre es mejor que dos ya ves
Ménage à trois
Porque la vida es muy corta
Ménage à trois
Haz tu sueño realidad
Ménage à trois
Que nadie es dueño de nadie
Ménage à trois
Porque eres la libertad
Trio de ases si juegas
Si estudias regla de tres
Tres uves cuando navegas
Tres seises soy Lucifer
Tres veces la serpiente se enrosca
Tres deseos pedirás
Y tres cojones me importa
lo que digan los demás
Tres fueron los mosqueteros
Tres veces Pedro negó
Tres los cerditos del cuento
Tres siempre es mejor que dos ya te digo
Ménage à trois
Porque la vida es muy corta
Ménage à trois
Haz tu sueño realidad
Ménage à trois
Que nadie es dueño de nadie
Ménage à trois
Porque eres la libertad
Hoy la iglesia acaba de decir
que es aborto asegurado
la pastilla del día después
que eso hay que condenarlo
Muchas preguntas llegan hasta mi
el condón se ha disparado
si ha todo le dicen que si
el mundo esta condenado
un abogado por favor
o un jurista reputado
expertos en legislación
ayúdenme que estoy liado
Mil dudas me asaltan
quien me las puede aclarar
todo apunta que hasta el papa vivirá con satanás
Bis
Es homicidio la mastubarcion
prematuro o premeditado
canibalismo es el sexo oral
¡cuantos viven en pecado
un angelito acabo de asfixiar
con el condón que me he puesto
es abandono de un pobre menor
la marcha atrás en el lecho
y así pensando estoy fatal
temo que mi alma se pierda
pues practicando el sexo anal
cuantos bebes he mandado a la mierda
Mil dudas me asaltan
quien me las puede aclarar
todo apunta que hasta el papa vivirá con satanásThreshold of Pain
I'm the master of pain
The one that drives you insane
Chosen to be my little toy
Come to my world and enjoy
As I play with you my little game
Your body hooked limbly to the frame
Pinned on a pillar your dripping remains
When I take you beyond the threshold of pain
Slowly I'll take off your beautiful skin
Cut off your tongue and do you in
Suck your tasty blood drop by drop
There's no fucking way to let it stop
Die you helpless bastard
For I command your breath
Cry you helpless bastard
As I demand your death
Threshold of Pain 
Threshold of Pain 
Abusing your body without end
Until it's more than you can stand
When you stop screaming and wondering why
My fun is over I let you die
Die you helpless bastard
For I command your breath
Cry you helpless bastard
As I demand your death
Now you see me now you don't
You are me and I am you
When you bleed I feel the pain
I'm your dark half
The sparrows fly again
Harbingers of the dead
It's me they're coming for
Get me out of your head
From the living to the dead
They're here to fly me away
Slowly I'm falling apart
I'll make you write then I can stay
It all began so long ago you ate me in the womb
In hospital I passed away now I've risen from my tomb
Your head starts to ache again the birds begin to sing
This time you can't flee me nor the terrors that I bring
Your career is built by me
Still you deny my existence
I kill all those who defy me
Tried to tell you but you don't listen
By the time I'm done with you
It will be you they take away
You will be me I will be you
I live to see another day
Now your writingdays are over
It is time to start mine
Psycho pomps coming for me
Will take you instead of me
You write I write I live You die 
I've got a little secret
A place with pleasure and pain
You only have to solve the puzzle
You can share with me this treasure
Walls are opening the labyrinth
There's plenty time to see
Servey and judge the place
After this you belong to me
What's life worth to you
All kinds of madness come your way
Try to escape and survive
There's no way out so stay
Walls are opening the labyrinth
There's plenty time to see
Servey and judge the place
After this you belong to me
To enter you must show your pain
We're only interested in your skin
We travel through time to bring death
Play the game and we let you in
It's not the most pleasant way to die
See you taking your last breath
So this was my story of the labyrinth
En este mundo de tanta crueldad
En donde reina la desigualdad
Unos perdonan otros cometen
Pero todo sigue igual
Viviendo el ritual de la adoración
Los sicarios gozan la ensoñación
Baños de sangre agua bendita
Del odio consagración
Viva el tiempo de la bestia
Viva el tiempo de la bestia
Hermanos contra hermanos
Se matarán Y de sus carnes se alimentarán
Unos imploran otros reniegan
Asunción infernal
Ya se escucha el reino llegar Generaciones lo aclaman ya
Drogas y muerte dolor y pena
La sinfonía empezará
Viva el tiempo de la bestia
Viva el tiempo de la bestia
Son tan pobres
que dios los ha olvidado
prófugos han sido
de su amor
Se defendieron
con plegarias y rosarios
que todo el mundo ignoró
Fuego y metal
sangre en el barro
son los mártires de acteal
Lágrimas de horror
están cultivando
guerrilleros de nueva generación
Mutilación y muerte
en niños y mujeres
carnicería enferma abominal
Fuego y metal
sangre en el barro
son los mártires de acteal
Fuego y metal
espíritus de lodo
son los mártires de acteal
No esperes más
Ya es tiempo de divertirse
La inquisición ya terminó
Jesús Cristo se ha olvidado ya
De todos
El cielo nunca existió
Aquél partido del quien tú votaste
Sus promesas no cumplió
Y de esa novia de la que te enamoraste
A otro la virginidad entregó
Ven a quemarle las patas al diablo
Te vas a divertir
Ven a quemarle las patas al diablo
Te vas a divertir
No tienes más vida
Que la que se acaba
Y la esperanza nunca volvió
Los sacerdotes siempre te mintieron
Disfruta mientras puedas esta canción
Los he visto crecer
como las ratas
son de azul café o corbata
Con placa de asesinos y ladrones
nadie pára a esos pinches cabrones
siendo alacranes en los agujeros
Roban a todos son unos culeros
son de oficina y son del gobierno
se quedan con todo el maldito dinero
Tira
vomita la calle escupe un policia
Tira
si vas al baño caga un policia
Tira
no votes por nadie mea un policia
Tira
que chingue a su madre la policia
Tienen patrullas en todas las calles
y te madrean hasta que no hables
si los denuncias no les pasa nada
Son intocables son pura chingada
ya no soporto estos perros rabiosos
se chupan la sangre
De todos nosotros
nuestros impuestos llenan su paga
se creen la autoridad pero de cagada
Estoy aquí una vez más
Hincado ante tus pies
Estoy tratando de comprender
Porqué tu doctrina no puede ser
Puse una mejilla y me la golpearon
Dí la espalda y me la apuñalearon
Amé al enemigo como tú dijíste
Para encontrar venganza y rencor
Estoy aquí una vez más
Para encontrar tu fe
Que confundida con los odios
No me dejan verte bien
A nombre tuyo pueblos han masacrado
A sangre y fuego los evangelizaron
Han hecho mercado con tu memoria
Y violado la paz de tu gloria
Estoy aquí una vez más
Implorándote amor
Sé que un milagro podrá sanarme
De este terrible temor
Tus ministros se han enriquecido
Con placeres se han embrutecido
Hicieron mentira de tus palabras
Para esconder avaricia y poder
The angel show me a shine
of the storm
Our father is my lord
And his power tought me now
That the time is over now
I saw in his eyes
the courages of the wrath
To take complain
Of the heaven in divine
Revelation of the life
In the farthest place
Killing to the art
With the sacred bread
Raw and burning souls
That are paying their sins
Vomiting fire
over corpses fields
Ho sana hey ho sana ha
Come to adore
Ho sana hey ho sana ha
Nuclear assault
God has to bless to the ones
In his word believe
And now he´s asking for
What is missing of him
The darkness is comming
From the price of your sins
The judgement day has come
With the blood and screams
Un Angel me mostro el resplandor
De dios nuestro señor
y su poder me enseño
que el tiempo terminó
Vi en sus ojos el coraje de la ira
Que reclamaba una venganza divina
Revelación del más allá de la vida
Arte de matar con la ostia concebida
Almas calcinadas
Que ya pagan sus pecados
Vomitos de fuego
Sobre cuerpos mutilados
Oh Sana Hey
Oh Sana Ha
Ven a adorar
Oh Sana Hey
Oh Sana Ha
La era nuclear
Dios ha bendecido
A los que en su palabra creen
y hoy te pide cuentas
De lo que le debes a él
La Muerte ha sido la factura
De tu Proceder
De todos tus pecados
Hoy es tiempo de responder
Hoy puede ser un día sangriento
Las nubes son más que grises
Se avecinan plegarias tristes
De santos corridos del infierno
Dios ha renegado de su hijo
En una doctrina incomprensible
Te resbalas en el vómito invisible
En la profecía que nunca se dijo
Hoy es viernes 13
Hoy es viernes 13
Todas la putas hoy son santas
Y de sus pechos nacen sabiduría
Que callan del poeta su palabrería
Enseñándole la vileza humana
Hoy la carne reclama compañía
Gritando las pasiones deshonradas
De nada sirven las iluminadas
Cuando un imperio avernal te guía
Hoy es viernes 13
Hoy es viernes 13
La sangre se funde con el vino
En un elíxir oscuro de la vida
Y el arcángel protége la huída
Del placer con pecado concebido
De nada servirán las bendiciones
Ni los amuletos con agua bendita
Pues la pasión será maldita
Que no habrá lugar
A contricciones
Congelaste el tiempo
En la mugre de tus uñas
Me viste desfilar desnudo
En el espacio de tu vida
Hiciste que el pecado
Fuera pesadilla deliciosa
Cobrándome la penitencia
En la carne propia
Bañaron mis palabras
Lloviznas de flores
Que alfileres se hicieron
Al paso de míos temores
Maldijiste conjuros
Con el permiso del cielo
Dejándome el estigma
De tus malditos besos
Cayendo así en el elixir
De tu hechizo
Del que se va
Del infierno al paraíso
Descubrir tu piel ha sido
El placer del evangelio
Que pregono el dolor
De la pasión de mi tiempo
Eres la última virgen
De tu propio templo
Y yo un devoto perdido
De ese gran misterio
Purificaste mi pena
Con una espina
Pero olvidaste
Cerrarme la herida
Nos vemos
Como los primeros cristianos
Con el temor
De las fauces del león
Pero con la luz en las manos
Nos vemos
Como ladrones de relíquias de santos
Con la angustia de sentir el pecado
Pero con la suerte de tener un milagro
Hijos del eclipse
Nos declaró la noche momentánea
Amantes sin discurso
Que se diluyen por la mañana
Nos vemos
Porque la justicia no existe
En el instinto del correr del tiempo
Que traga lentamente el encuentro
Nos vemos
Aunque la lluvia derrita el suelo
Pues hemos sabido que en el lodo
También se puede llorar el consuelo
Hijos del eclipse
Nos declaró la noche momentánea
Amantes sin discurso
Que se diluyen por la mañana
No me puedes culpar
De que no sea un héroe
De que no sea tan popular
Como el presidente
Soy más allá
De lo que me puedan ver
Soy resurrección
De poesía maldita
Soy un sobreviviente
Del infierno
Ya nada
Me puede asustar
Soy un sobreviviente
Del infierno
Inmune a la calamidad
Mi llanto ha bañado
El coraje y la tristeza
Mi alma está excomulgada
De la Divina Providencia
Soy más allá
De lo que me puedan ver
Soy resurrección

Eventually we all take life for granted
It's not until we take that last gasp of air before we truly can appreciate the simplicity of seeing feeling hearing smelling and tasting life
Death hadeath comes to us all
Of father please forgive my sins I've take lives with my bear hands
This guilt has grown inside of me I cannot cry nor can I hide
I broke the glass reflection died
The mirror lies deformed and blind
I cannot face my image more
I've cut my hand bled for my land
A child with no name is easier to mould
A mouth of no words far better controlled
No one to claim his rights to say goodnight
Letting my hate grow up before I could
I became the hands of god
 Father forgive me father for I have sinned
 When was your last confession my child
 This is my very first
I'm here to clear my conscience for a while
Let you know what kind of monster I am
Taking life that is the only gift
Of which I have been blessed with
Always disguised even your eyes they lie
I have carried on for centuries
Taking orders from the men of the light
Making sure I'm always paid enough
I'm greedy you know
11 bags of cash
Blood money barely touched
I shed a tear
I didn't know I had them
Last time I cried it was for fear
Those memories I thought I've long forgotten
Haunt me at night like the howling winds outside
Killing is how I stay alive
Just like your lord created earth in seven days
That's what I have no second more to mark my pray
I am the wolf and they are sheep easy to tame
There's no crime
In praying for time
Seven Days
A mission to detain democracy
In a land where a red rose makes the rules
I hope this other half enjoyed the flick
At the cinema show
No guard in sight the stairs a freedom path
I shed a tear
I didn't know I had them
Last time I cried it was for fear
Those memories I thought I've long forgotten
Haunt me at night like the howling winds outside
Killing is how I stay alive
Just like your lord created earth in seven days
That's what I have no second more to mark my pray
I am the wolf and they are sheep easy to tame
There's no crime
In praying for time
Seven Days
One shot's enough for a red rose to wither
How straight is your spine after I'm done
Let the angels cry and carry you home
Sleep like a stone your time here is done
In time I will dance on your grave
In time I will dance
Condemn me
I'm guilty
Candles blow out when you're near
Just like your lord created earth in seven days
That's what I have no second more to mark my pray
I am the wolf and they are sheep easy to tame
There's no crime
In praying for time
Seven Days
I know you
Despise you
But I need your help
Hope is at large
Sweet Novocain
Condemnation
Frozen in time covering my years you are the savior
Take these pills you say
Chase the world away
I rush to drink some water
Holy water boils
Say can you heal this sad headache
The morphine of my life
The bells of desecration
Always ringing in my ears
As the shadows of deception
Might arrest the best of me
Oh priest please help me
Assassination
It's in my nature
Show me the gold
A hand full for a restless tomb
Assassination
Sowing this nation
Cynical world
No matter how rich you are
Always a price on your head
The joke's on you
Three shots in the head
Enough to clear his mind
A rather fading color
Weakening your bones
Crossing the lake
Baring the flame
Intentions have gone mad
The bells desecration
Always ringing in my ears
As the shadows of deception
Might arrest the best of me
Oh priest please help me
Assassination
It's in my nature
Show me the gold
A hand full for a restless tomb
Assassination
Sowing this nation
Cynical world
No matter how rich you are
Always a price on your head
The joke's on you
All we are is dust
Pointless lives crying when there's loss broken there
I shall liberate you from your walls
Help you cross that border
Climb and fall climb and fall
Crossing the lake
Baring the flame
Dimensions have gone mad
Like the intentions of a child
Assassination
It's in my nature
Show me the gold
A hand full for a restless tomb
Assassination
Sowing this nation
A cynical world
There is no room for the facts
Proof is a slap on your face
The joke's on you
The joke's on you
Scenery was drawn
Easy to obtain
Help from media
Camera everywhere
Time to make my move
Safe behind my lens
Fast decisions
Breathing down my neck
I'll be
Like a shadow on your back
Like the beggar flips a coin
Like clockwork I will hit
How can you sit there
While there's so much chaos been unleashed
A penny for your thoughts
The TV is rather calm
Watching all this chaos caving in
It's all caving in
Lights are blinding me
Sun is burning me
In broad daylight
Suspensions killing me
Then I get a go
The bullet leaves my gun
Rest in peace now
A martyr you shall be
I'll be
Like a monkey on your back
Like the beggar flips a coin
For like clockwork I will hit
How can you sit there
While there's so much chaos been unleashed
A penny for your thoughts
The TV is rather calm
Watching all this chaos caving in
It's all caving in
Right on your face
Like a fly landing on the tip of your nose
Your TV dinner tastes
Like the blood on my hands
Crime on prime time is on today's menu
How can you sit there
While there's so much chaos been unleashed
A penny for your thoughts
The TV is rather calm
Watching all this chaos caving in
It's all caving in
So how can they sit there
My son why won't you see the light in heaven
I rather rule in hell than to serve in heaven father
Your job's to rescue me today
So don't fill my head with empty thoughts
From where I am there's no return
The power of your mighty words
Claiming my crown is made of thorns
Made to keep the evil out
I'm here to find out
If there's more to life than death
Ironic how god slaps your face
And he will always be
Like a cockroach in your mouth
Laying eggs inside your brain
I will not make it through the pearly gates
Carrying chains of doom
Hell's invitation is burning out
The devil sends regards
Let me taste the apples again
Wouldn't want to ruin your plan
Like I did the last time
So please release me
From these chains of doom
I felt the weight of that day
Thought I was not the only one
To cast the first stone in the crowd
A punishment for changing lanes
Nobody likes the way you talk
The way your X is held up tall
So rest in my arms
While you finish your last breath
Ironic how god slaps your face
And he will always be
Like a cockroach in your mouth
Laying eggs inside your brain
I will not make it through the pearly gates
Carrying chains of doom
Hell's invitation is burning out
The devil sends regards
Let me taste the apples again
Wouldn't want to ruin your plan
Like I did the last time ha ha ha
So please release me
From these chains of
Hell belongs to me
You can walk the clouds
Promises to keep
before I claim my crown
Heaven is a trick
You can hardly wait
For the punch line is
Endless Emptiness
I will not make it through the pearly gates
Carrying chains of doom
Hell's invitation is burning out
The devil sends regards
Let me taste the apples again
Wouldn't want to ruin your plan
Like I did the last time ha ha ha
So please release me
From these chains of doom
Paradise will never open up
For a man with chains of doom
The gates of hell open for anyone
Surely I can never be included
Only spotless lives approved
Wouldn't want to ruin your garden there
I'm here to find out
A disgraceful kind of trap
For a democratic rat
To drive into my sight
I am sweating in the crowd
In this desert dollar town
A shot for mercy calls
The world is mine
Soon as the bullet goes
Through your brain
Come thunderstorm and rain
Flush your blood down the drain
One last with before the flood
Then I knew that I've become
My own nightmare with a gun
Feed my revolver
Every corner that I turn
Every eye ball I confront
Feeds my revolver
Feed my revolver
Guess it's time to reload
Someone else will take the fall
For the sins that I have caused
The media will fail
And the other they won't know
As they shot into the dark
For answers come to me
The world is mine
Soon as the CIA cuts your face
Come former presidents
Wash Jackie's tears away
One last toast before the fraud
Then I knew that I've become
My own nightmare with a gun
Feed my revolver
Every corner that I turn
Every eye ball I confront
Feeds my revolver
Feed my revolver
Guess it's time to reload
The facts don't lie
I'm practically just shoving them deep down your throat
I am free from the guilt
Forgive me
May I have this last dance
The world is stunned
It's like I killed a butterfly
My job here is done
I wash my hands
In grassy knoll
That's when I knew that I've become
My own nightmare with a gun
Feed my revolver
Everyday I'm getting worse
Killing time in my own terms
Feed my revolver
Feed my revolver
I guess it's time to reload
Feed my revolver
Who is this crying woman
She claims she's blood with me
The only proof she carries plays a melody
A gift from me
As I dismiss her reasons
She hands me one last thing
A picture of her mother
Suddenly I see
Open my wound pour salt on it
The grave digger's big shame
Ask em what purpose I fill
Bless your heart for it's so pure
I sleep with the lights on
Hug a pillow up front
The lullaby song the sandman hums
Might come true
Twist the dagger out of my old wound
Ashes to ashes in land lullaby
That night I had to head out
The men of light insist
The cleansing of a member
Whose powers had grown weak
Must separate the two roles
Of father and a beast
I just can't close the door now it's reality
Open my wound pour salt on it
The grave digger's big shame
Ask em what purpose I fill
Bless your heart for it's so pure
I sleep with the lights on
Hug a pillow up front
The lullaby song from your music box
Makes me fight for you
Even if it's the last thing I ever do
Ashes to ashes in land lullaby
She's a fraud
Cast away the music once played to you
The voice of reason
Commands you now
The beautiful illusion
Of a ticking bomb
Waiting for the finger of destiny
Maybe you are right and I am wrong
Open my wound pour salt on it
The grave digger's big shame
Ask me what purpose I fill
Bless your heart for it's so pure
I sleep with the lights on
Hug a pillow up front
The lullaby song the sandman hums
Might come true
Twist the dagger out of my old wound
Ashes to ashes in land lullaby
In land lullaby
Keep living in land lullaby
 It's open
 Hi I'm Norma Jean
 Enchanting just take off your clothes will you
Obscene is the man watching a woman undress herself
Pleasure is given but not responded
Loneliness says yes but November says no
A window to her soul they say
December her soul's gone astray
Climb climb while you still can
The ladder is slippery but fair
When you least expect it
The lust that I see in your eyes watching me tonight
I hope that it's real
I'm down and lonely
Happiness killed what little was left of me
A thousand for love you say
I guess it's OK
Fly fly while you still can
For life will punish all the fools
When you least expect it in the eleventh hour
The hour of need
Moscow is quiet tonight
It's cold out here
I'm dazzled by the lights
And this snow
The trees all painted white
It's plain to see
My coat is not enough
Against this snow
It's this snow
I believe
Is it true what they say
That all beauty must fade
Something woke in me
When that light bulb screamed
I stopped to catch my balance
No cold sustains me
Soon I blame this snow
I'm sure it's this snow
Yes I believe
The mission is today
The men of light are watching me
Last time I had heard from him
Was during the cold war
Our differences had grown much further
Since bombing London
Back then
Where we shared a cold drink
Not knowing it was your blood
Running down my veins now
Poisoning me
The policy of a rotten state
Chokes anyone who makes a fist
Death is confusing man like
Red winter sirens
The legacy of a new born faith
Dies from the taste of mother's milk
The come retaliation
Feeding you silence
Eat all you can
It's only sand
Nothing could prepare me less
For the terror I was up against
We were broken out of bullets
Loading our half loyalty
Back now
Shaking hands for the last time
I can only imagine how to tear your heart out
How can this be
The policy of a rotten state
Chokes anyone who makes a fist
Death is confusing man like
Red winter sirens
The legacy of a new born faith
Dies from the taste of mother's milk
The come retaliation
Feeding you silence
Eat all you can
It's only sand
It's only sand but it's tainted with your blood
And yet still they try to make you eat your name
It's only sand
Look how far we've come with these loaded guns
Blame human race
Blame this damn rat race
The policy of a rotten state
Chokes anyone who makes a fist
Death is confusing man like
Red winter sirens
The legacy of a new born faith
Dies from the taste of mother's milk
The come retaliation
Feeding you silence
Eat all you can
It's only sand
The fountain of trust
Has dwelled into dust
The old tree has been offended
A fellowship has ended
I am the war you cannot end
I am the scent you cannot stand
The cancer of a cigarette
I hide my tears from your demands
I hate your guts still here I am
A rotten corpse on your behalf
Treated like a teddy by a lonely child
Just like a snake I change my skin
Open your eyes and realize
Living in shadows I can see
Who has grown horns and wings
Constant craving
For the innocent blood of yours
Save your praying
For it's making my pale skin crawl
Skin crawl
So let them think it's suicide
You know the mob is water proof
Nothing can move that mountain there
They think they know how brought this mess
The hammer falls but once again
Justice prevails blind as a bat
One hundred red steps away from his door
Just like a snake I change my skin
Seeking the truth door slams on you
Living in shadows I can see
The raven is passing me
Constant craving
For the innocent blood of yours
Save your praying
For it's making my pale skin crawl
Skin crawl
Oh how I long for ancient times
Where a man could take charge
Of his own mind
For in prison they hold
Our brothers in chains
And no lesson is learned
For freedom is frail
Hold your flag high
In proudness
Don't let them take what's yours
I'm here to bring back the balance
Before it's too late for us
Now we stand
In the shadows
Of a land
That you used to own
Use your hands
For all that matters
Your graveyard hands
They have to learn
We are not slaves
Let the ground we adore
Grow without shame
For we sow the first tree
It belong to us
And when you drew first blood
You crossed that line
I say hold your flag high
In proudness
Don't let them take what's yours
I'm here to bring back the balance
Before it's too late for us
Now we stand
In the shadows
Of a land
That you used to own
Use your hands
For all that matters
Your graveyard hands
Carry the crops
Of those who fought side by side with you
Sing the fanfare
So their names won't be lost no
Now we stand
In the shadows
Of a land
That you used to own
Use your hands
For all that matters
Your graveyard hands
Higher
Embrace the filthy sky
The point of no return
Is here upon us
Dust to dust
The fear taught you to fly
Gravity is for them
Those non believers
So the thread that you proudly hang on
Eventually it will snap
The perfection is ruining your temple
Tickles a smile on my lips
For when I say goodnight it always means forever
You'll see your life flash by for a second
And when your eyes roll back
I'll cry the tears of joy
Count your blessings now it's better
Time to say
Goodnight
Rest assure
Your legacy will die
The serpent is the fool
He's out of venom
Feed the crows
Their feathers are like mine
Waiting for a dove
We long for supper
So the thread that you proudly hang on
Eventually it will snap
The perfection is ruining your temple
Tickles a smile on my lips
For when I say goodnight it always means forever
You'll see your life flash by for a second
And when your eyes roll back
I'll cry the tears of joy
Count your blessings now it's better
Time to say
Goodnight
Here's a chair
Here's a rope
You know what to do
Make sure the knot is tight enough for me for you
If you find heaven
You got nothing to fear
Not at all
Garden of Eden
Is a cemetery
Not far from hell
For when I say goodnight it always means forever
You'll see your life flash by for a second
And when your eyes roll back
I'll cry the tears of joy
Count your blessings now it's better
Time to say
Goodnight
Have to make the choice of whom
Who should live and who should rule
The end of the rainbow is here
So the persecution begins
Which the laws of ancient rituals of course forbid
They told me to turn the other cheek express humanity
An eye for an eye seems reasonable to me
Purify my rights
Vendetta in my mind
The way that you always treated me
Crushing a bright future
A dream
The scars that you left
Physically and mentally
Inside of me
The beast in me attempts to come alive
Who dares to open Pandora's Box
The end of light and start of dark
Who cares to listen to the tones made for the gods
Your cross won't help you now it won't
Oh these ashes will redeem
White and clean like sanity if you will
Who are you to point fingers
A garden always got one rotten rose look at me
We we are but wicked men
Trying to raise the bar of hope
Nailing shut the last coffin
Purify my rights
Vendetta in mind
The way that you used the bible priest
Smashing my face with discipline
The scars that you left
Locking hate and misery
Inside of me
The beast in me attempts to come alive
Come alive
Half the world know the reasons
Why I hate you so much lord
My life is like a book
You read and you want more
What more is there to do
What more is there to add
I am going nowhere
Facing my demons
Better to abort the plan
No rescuing
My destiny is shut
Who had the guts to open Pandora's Box
Goodbye to light enter the dark
Once you burned bright now you feel cold
I want to be like one of you
Perfect wife and a dog how I envy you all
One last kiss
The truth shall set you free
Lucky me that you wore black
A tired weak old man
Three shots away from homeLife life is such a ridiculous word if you think of it
Eventually we all take life for granted
It's not until we take that last gasp of air before we truly can appreciate the simplicity of seeing feeling hearing smelling and tasting life
Death hadeath comes to us all

The cleansing of a member
Whose powers had grown weak
Must separate the two roles
Of father and a beast
I just can't close the door now it's reality
Open my wound pour salt on it
The grave digger's big shame
Ask em what purpose I fill
Bless your heart for it's so pure
I sleep with the lights on
Hug a pillow up front
The lullaby song from your music box
Makes me fight for you
Even if it's the last thing I ever do
Ashes to ashes in land lullaby
She's a fraud
Cast away the music once played to you
The voice of reason
Commands you now
The beautiful illusion
Of a ticking bomb
Waiting for the finger of destiny
Maybe you are right and I am wrong
Open my wound pour salt on it
The grave digger's big shame
Ask me what purpose I fill
Bless your heart for it's so pure
I sleep with the lights on
Hug a pillow up front
The lullaby song the sandman hums
Might come true
Twist the dagger out of my old wound
Ashes to ashes in land lullaby
In land lullaby
Keep living in land lullaby
 It's open
 Hi I'm Norma Jean
 Enchanting just take off your clothes will you
Obscene is the man watching a woman undress herself
Pleasure is given but not responded
Loneliness says yes but November says no
A window to her soul they say
December her soul's gone astray
Climb climb while you still can
The ladder is slippery but fair
When you least expect it
The lust that I see in your eyes watching me tonight
I hope that it's real
I'm down and lonely
Happiness killed what little was left of me
A thousand for love you say
I guess it's OK
Fly fly while you still can
For life will punish all the fools
When you least expect it in the eleventh hour
The hour of need
Moscow is quiet tonight
It's cold out here
I'm dazzled by the lights
And this snow
The trees all painted white
It's plain to see
My coat is not enough
Against this snow
It's this snow
I believe
Is it true what they say
That all beauty must fade
Something woke in me
When that light bulb screamed
I stopped to catch my balance
No cold sustains me
Soon I blame this snow
I'm sure it's this snow
Yes I believe
The mission is today
The men of light are watching me
Last time I had heard from him
Was during the cold war
Our differences had grown much further
Since bombing London
Back then
Where we shared a cold drink
Not knowing it was your blood
Running down my veins now
Poisoning me
The policy of a rotten state
Chokes anyone who makes a fist
Death is confusing man like
Red winter sirens
The legacy of a new born faith
Dies from the taste of mother's milk
The come retaliation
Feeding you silence
Eat all you can
It's only sand
Nothing could prepare me less
For the terror I was up against
We were broken out of bullets
Loading our half loyalty
Back now
Shaking hands for the last time
I can only imagine how to tear your heart out
How can this be
The policy of a rotten state
Chokes anyone who makes a fist
Death is confusing man like
Red winter sirens
The legacy of a new born faith
Dies from the taste of mother's milk
The come retaliation
Feeding you silence
Eat all you can
It's only sand
It's only sand but it's tainted with your blood
And yet still they try to make you eat your name
It's only sand
Look how far we've come with these loaded guns
Blame human race
Blame this damn rat race
The policy of a rotten state
Chokes anyone who makes a fist
Death is confusing man like
Red winter sirens
The legacy of a new born faith
Dies from the taste of mother's milk
The come retaliation
Feeding you silence
Eat all you can
It's only sand
The fountain of trust
Has dwelled into dust
The old tree has been offended
A fellowship has ended
I am the war you cannot end
I am the scent you cannot stand
The cancer of a cigarette
I hide my tears from your demands
I hate your guts still here I am
A rotten corpse on your behalf
Treated like a teddy by a lonely child
Just like a snake I change my skin
Open your eyes and realize
Living in shadows I can see
Who has grown horns and wings
Constant craving
For the innocent blood of yours
Save your praying
For it's making my pale skin crawl
Skin crawl
So let them think it's suicide
You know the mob is water proof
Nothing can move that mountain there
They think they know how brought this mess
The hammer falls but once again
Justice prevails blind as a bat
One hundred red steps away from his door
Just like a snake I change my skin
Seeking the truth door slams on you
Living in shadows I can see
The raven is passing me
Constant craving
For the innocent blood of yours
Save your praying
For it's making my pale skin crawl
Skin crawl
Oh how I long for ancient times
Where a man could take charge
Of his own mind
For in prison they hold
Our brothers in chains
And no lesson is learned
For freedom is frail
Hold your flag high
In proudness
Don't let them take what's yours
I'm here to bring back the balance
Before it's too late for us
Now we stand
In the shadows
Of a land
That you used to own
Use your hands
For all that matters
Your graveyard hands
They have to learn
We are not slaves
Let the ground we adore
Grow without shame
For we sow the first tree
It belong to us
And when you drew first blood
You crossed that line
I say hold your flag high
In proudness
Don't let them take what's yours
I'm here to bring back the balance
Before it's too late for us
Now we stand
In the shadows
Of a land
That you used to own
Use your hands
For all that matters
Your graveyard hands
Carry the crops
Of those who fought side by side with you
Sing the fanfare
So their names won't be lost no
Now we stand
In the shadows
Of a land
That you used to own
Use your hands
For all that matters
Your graveyard hands
Higher
Embrace the filthy sky
The point of no return
Is here upon us
Dust to dust
The fear taught you to fly
Gravity is for them
Those non believers
So the thread that you proudly hang on
Eventually it will snap
The perfection is ruining your temple
Tickles a smile on my lips
For when I say goodnight it always means forever
You'll see your life flash by for a second
And when your eyes roll back
I'll cry the tears of joy
Count your blessings now it's better
Time to say
Goodnight
Rest assure
Your legacy will die
The serpent is the fool
He's out of venom
Feed the crows
Their feathers are like mine
Waiting for a dove
We long for supper
So the thread that you proudly hang on
Eventually it will snap
The perfection is ruining your temple
Tickles a smile on my lips
For when I say goodnight it always means forever
You'll see your life flash by for a second
And when your eyes roll back
I'll cry the tears of joy
Count your blessings now it's better
Time to say
Goodnight
Here's a chair
Here's a rope
You know what to do
Make sure the knot is tight enough for me for you
If you find heaven
You got nothing to fear
Not at all
Garden of Eden
Is a cemetery
Not far from hell
For when I say goodnight it always means forever
You'll see your life flash by for a second
And when your eyes roll back
I'll cry the tears of joy
Count your blessings now it's better
Time to say
Goodnight
Have to make the choice of whom
Who should live and who should rule
The end of the rainbow is here
So the persecution begins
Which the laws of ancient rituals of course forbid
They told me to turn the other cheek express humanity
An eye for an eye seems reasonable to me
Purify my rights
Vendetta in my mind
The way that you always treated me
Crushing a bright future
A dream
The scars that you left
Physically and mentally
Inside of me
The beast in me attempts to come alive
Who dares to open Pandora's Box
The end of light and start of dark
Who cares to listen to the tones made for the gods
Your cross won't help you now it won't
Oh these ashes will redeem
White and clean like sanity if you will
Who are you to point fingers
A garden always got one rotten rose look at me
We we are but wicked men
Trying to raise the bar of hope
Nailing shut the last coffin
Purify my rights
Vendetta in mind
The way that you used the bible priest
Smashing my face with discipline
The scars that you left
Locking hate and misery
Inside of me
The beast in me attempts to come alive
Come alive
Half the world know the reasons
Why I hate you so much lord
My life is like a book
You read and you want more
What more is there to do
What more is there to add
I am going nowhere
Facing my demons
Better to abort the plan
No rescuing
My destiny is shut
Who had the guts to open Pandora's Box
Goodbye to light enter the dark
Once you burned bright now you feel cold
I want to be like one of you
Perfect wife and a dog how I envy you all
One last kiss
The truth shall set you free
Lucky me that you wore black
A tired weak old man
Three shots away from homeIf this is really living
Then why am I so unforgiving
Half the world is down the toilet
Half on its way
If I had a dollar for every time he hollers
Trust us with your hearts and minds
Or I'll make you pay
Trust me
Trust me
Ask me why you're feeling screwed
And I'll give you the answer
There's a Colon Dick  Bush
Justa hammerin' away
Ask me why you feel deceived
Stripped of all your liberties
It doesn't take a genius to explain
That today
Trust me
Trust me
I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting
Waiting for Christ in the USA
Waiting for Christ in the USA
Waiting for Christ in the USA
Waiting til I die
Waiting for the day

He needs me

You're wrong everytime
You're wrong everytime
What makes you think you've got a godgiven right
For killing people in a needless fight
You're like a rapist with a target in sight
Democracy
Whoever told you that you were bright
The skull and bones the conservative right
You're like a plague turning day into night
Atrocity
You're wrong everytime
You're wrong everytime
What makes you think that you could start this mess
Then crawl away to a world you detest
You're fuckin' evil but you couldn't care less
Conspiracy
What makes you think that we could ever believe
A major liar with a minor in greed
You make a profit of the people in need
Hypocrisy
You're wrong everytime
You're wrong everytime
Your time is coming and it won't be long
The bill of rights is now the bill of wrong
Already proven that you don't belong
In history
Your time is over  You'll be out on the street
What do you say to the people you meet
I saved the world because I didn't repeat
My policy
She started drinking wine
And then she couldn't stop
She must be out of her head
That's why she has to be shot
That's Warp City
I'll probably have to do time
Because I lost control
I'd rather drop on a dime
Than spend my life in a hole
That's Warp City
I got a hole in my head
Can't make the bleeding stop
I think I'll go back to bed
And wait around for the cops
That's Warp City
That's Warp City
I shot my family dead
Then turned the gun on me
Did what the demon said
He said he'd set me free
I hear voices in my head
Someone's voice is in my head
Be afraid
Be afraid
Take a pill and you'll get laid
Someone's gotta make it stop
Make it stop
Make it stop
Some stole the remote control
I can't even go to sleep
Voices in my head repeat
Stay awake
Stay awake
Like a car without a brake
I got nothing else to do
Sit around and watch the tube
Gather information
That is useless agrivation
I refuse
I refuse
To be any more confused
What is happening to me
Happens all across society
Make it stop
Make it stop
All of us are gonna rot
Living in a system
Where you can't connect the fucking dots
Stop
I hear voices inside my head
Someone's voice is in my head
The time is right for decision
The time is right for those with something to say
This is the world I envision
The type of world where people aren't afraid
What in the world have we done
What in the world
The time is right for revision
The time is right for revolution today
This is a world in sedition
This is a world that hasn't found its way
What in the world have we done
What in the world
What in the world have we done
What in the world
No time to fight for permission
No time is right for those who hesitate
This is a world in atrition
The world we live in is the world we make
What in the world have we done
What in the world
What in the world have we done
What in the world
I got your picture
You gave your soul to me
You're my addiction
I'm sure you'd have to agree
Idolized by zeros
I know all of your faces
I've even watched you sleep
You're my obsession
Your life is mine to keep
Idolized by zeros
I got all of your letters
Told me to stay away
You know me better
I'll pay a visit today
Idolized idolized idolized by zeros
Idolized idolized idolized by zeros
Life sucks
And death is calling
Every day
I keep my chin up
But my spirit's falling
Every day
On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on
Last night
Won't see the morning
Every day
I see the sunset as an endless warning
Every day
On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on
Knife cuts
Thru all that I wanted
Every day
It's like living in a
House that's haunted
Every day
On and on and on and on
It goes
On and on and on and on
and all is well in our world
Let's go to the edge of disaster
Push the pedal and go a little faster
Let's slam into a wall at ramming speed
Let's go to the edge of a mountain
Jump off and lets start countin'
Hit the ground and tell me if it bleeds
Let's go insane
Let's go insane
Let's go to the edge of reality
Let's go for total insanity
Let's go for a government based on greed
Let's go for the final attack
Let's go for a war in Iraq
Let's go for starting up World War III
Let's go insane
Let's go insane
Make my reservation
Let's go for the ultimate crime
Let's go for the end of time
Let's go for an ethnic cleansing spree
Let's go for the final battle
Let's slaughter them all like cattle
Let's go to our graves in victory
Let's go insane
Let's go insane
Let's goinsane
A famous middleaged rock'n'roller called me last week to thank me
for speaking out against the war only to tell me he could not speak
himself because he fears repercussions If you oppose this
administration there can and will be ramifications

What do you say to the ones you love
About the violence you've seen
Third time back from the war in Iraq
A never ending dream
Bodies and limbs scattered all over town
It's all I ever see
Come back home to the same ol' shit
There's nothing here for me
Life is good
What do you say to the best of friends
When they ask what it's like
I tell them I kill everything that moves
Within my rifle site
I look into the eyes of my unborn child
And I tell you what I see
The same damn eyes as a day old corpse
On a highway full of IEDs
Life is good
What do you say to the guy on the street
Who wants to shake your hand
I'd rather take him down then talk to him later
You wouldn't understand
I didn't ever really wanna be this way
But this is what I've become
Can't wait to see my unit again
To live and die by the gun
Life is good
I've got something to get off my chest
I've got a person that scares me to death
First name is Dick and you know the rest
Well I've got something I just got to say

My name is Cheney I got no remorse���� run run run Cheney's got a gun

Of his Number One

What's done is done
The occupation of Satan is near��� run run run Cheney's having fun
Now Revelations is oh so near
For everyone
Dick Cheney Son of Satan
He is the chosen one
Born and raised in the USA
I got a different type of DNA
I got a bloodline from Texas to Maine
We run the world like a parlor game
I got twins and a Stepford wife
I never had to work a day in my life
I never studied but got my degree
I never had to with my family tree
Now I'm the last sucker
Now I'm the last one
No longer in charge
Of anyone
I got others tell me what to say
I'm like an actor in a tragic play
They give me speeches
I cant understand
It doesn't matter
As long as no one else can
Now I'm the last sucker
Now I'm the last one
No longer in charge
Of anyone
Last sucker sorry fucker

No longer in charge
Of anyone

It never mattered if we won or lost
You want it

Stuck in the middle of a civil war
Well what the fuck do you expect
Our occupation of other nations
Is bound to have a fucking violent effect
You want it

Can you feel the pressure of life I can feel it
You surviving through the mess and the strife I'm trying
Do you feel that you're living a lie Goddamn
Are you consumed by the passionate crime I am
Become a rascal and a scandalous type
And I just can't take this anymore
I can feel it
I can feel the pressures of this life
Turn away don't show your face
Forget your future is lost
Consumed by rage eyes full of hate
I pray for holocaust
God damned us all to hell to make us pay
Abandoned into immorality
I hate today I hate your tomorrow
I hate the way that no soul seems
to fucking care no more
I can feel it
I can feel the pressures of this life
Live fast die in a crash
Live fast die in a crash
Judgment day's upon us and I see no one cares
Lies for death in pools of blood and I'm stoned with fear
A trigger happy finger solves a problem not a prayer
I see this world falling apart and I fucking swear
It is the end of days
It is the end of days
We've clearly lost our way
Revelations dissipation condemnation
dissolution do you feel like you're under a gun
Desperation condemnation indignation terror nation
That's what the world is today
Hey Hey
It is the end of days
It is the end of days
We've clearly lost our way
Judgment day is upon us I don't care
Judgment day is upon us do ya fear
I'm in a world of shit I don't care
As the future unfolds in the end of days
Judgment of our times in biblical ways
Our man made gods genocide is faith
Idea warfare has been engaged
Cannot trust your fellow man at all these days
Sycophants out looking to get paid
Images burned into my face
Pangs of Distress salt my flesh to flay
I constantly fear everything I see
Blood is the fist of authority
Pestilence is my rabid dog unchained
Another road sign marks the end of days
I disregard those who govern me
I hate all of this treachery
I numb my mind and try to walk away
Toward the trail of tears and to the end of days
Face down on pavement and drunk at the end of my days
I hang from a noose that was made to slowly decay
The pangs of distress salt my flesh to slowly flay
Face down on pavement and drunk at the end of my days
The end of daysI'm the dark grandfather a newborn child
I'm the one who sow the seed of war
I was lost in deep ocean of my life
until I found myself and more 
I'm the one who's risen from the curse of death
I'm the raper of virgin and killer of whore
I've been here from beginning and now is the end
I shall proudly burn at stake Most evil of all 
I was hiding from daylight Hiding from sun
But the I became stronger Evil son
I got dark magic in my hands Sorcerer
I exist in higher forces but now I'll die with fire
This is beautiful morning of day
Birds are singing their symphonies today
Flowers are awakening again
but look my into my misery and face so pale
come darkest winter
sun burns my skin
My soul was born torn
but I don't have needs for pity
of summersun and white purity
pure darkness is only place to be
there's thousand seekers
who search for satan
those who found are here with me
there's thousand seekers
who search something more than we are
those who found are here with me
season
Give me a reason why i have to stay
show me how much there's time me to pray
darkness is paradise
beside I don't even need your advice
sweer darkest winter
came to meIn a Land of Darkness
In the dark of night only death in their souls
No escape you will die
Death warriors spreading fear
Ready to abolish mankind they are back back to kill
They are the legions
Legions of the dead
Slaves of death manifests in the light
Human extinction is at hand
Ripping our flesh tormenting our souls
They are the legions of the dead
I horde from above riding chariots on fire
Sealed with shining armours
Illuminating darkness
Chosen light to be their guide
In the dark of night they are back
Back to fight they are the legions
The legions of light
Holy servants avengers of justice
Demon extinction is at hand
Ripping their flesh tormenting their souls
They are the legions legions of light
I am the one who protects your innocence
I am the one who condemns all the lies
I am the one who gives you shelter through the pain
I am the one who gives you life
I am the one who devours your innocence
I am the one tormenting your flesh
I am the one feeding you guilt
I am the one demolishing your existence
They are Nemesis this is the final battle
The end has come with violence and bloodshed
This last confrontation a life ending struggle
Judgement day has come prepair for the doom
Brought into the mess called life
No purpose what so ever
Abused victim as a child raised as an orphan
Raised in a broken homedreaminghaunting memories
Victimized against their will
Human distraction has sealed our fate
Forced to repress doomed to forget
Holding your breath now so afraid
Grasping the rope in fear
Self distorted perception
A dark disease taking our lives
It's time to stand and rise against
Our life consuming enemy
We are the ones built on rage
We are the ones who share the pain
We are the ones who devours the others
A strong will is our demise
Where is your protective hand
Your guideline in the dark
Don't you know I will devour your soul
Deprive your life
You you are a man haunted by your past
Growing up to be a bitter man
Slowly dying fading away
Reflections of agonizing pain
Will it never end
Human distraction has sealed our fate
Hands crossed kneeling in pain
Gazing the heavens of blood red skies
Holding your breath waiting for a sign
Behind the darkness there is a call
If you do not answer you will fall
As you look into the depths of darkness
Illusions of your mind pursued by horror
Standing in the midst of total desolation
Trapped with the mask of sanity
Sevendriven by the seven deadly sins
Imprisoned by infinite horizons
Sevendeserted in a world without conception
Marked by the seven deadly sins
Deprived innocence from the dawn of time
A drowning mind in a dark embrace
Feel the thorns piercing the flesh
Massive neurosis and impending doom
Lust
Gluttony
Greed
Sloth
Wrath
Envy
Vanity
Scenery of death and distraction
Smoke screen and rays of light
Legions of death ready to fight
Harvest for souls collecting our bones
Massive hysteria doomsday mania
The legions have come to over run the land
The world blindly mislead
Reached the point of no return
The day of massacre the supreme sacrifice
Harvest for blood genocide or suicide
This is the end of days
Warriors of death all around
Soon to bring everything down
Going beyond the bounds of reason
Eternal dissention pure annihilation
Slaves of deadly fate eternal ghosts of war
The world is under subjection
Morbid actions that dominate
Hatred is spreading like an infection
Confused in darkest deception
A life under enslavement
Manifestation of fear as the dark reality unfolds
From earth to dust they were born
Unaware of the knowledge around
Evolving minds since the creation
Walking the path to meet their destiny
Paralysed in deepest fear
The reapers scythe is drawing near
The hour of death has arrived
Departed from humanity
They have eaten the frails of insanity
The black unfold like the curtains on stage
Eyes open knowing good and evil
Delusions of hope fading away
Banned into an endless journey
Finding comfort in a distant past
A roaming spirit forever lost
In great pain in sorrow
Cursed to be left behind
Unseen darkness it's coming near
The mystery of life now unfolding
From dust taken into dust they will return
Their roaming spirits forever lost
The greatest deceiver known to all men
Life consumer the one unseen
Poison running through my veins
A static mind no control rales my every move
Nothing feels right pushed to the edge
Have I lost it all
I am about to break
Living a constant lie my emotions have me paralyzed
I need a remedy make me whom I suppose to be
It is too late for regrets
Looking in the mirror don't recognize what I see
The life in me is gone fear tormenting me
Guilt won't let me be feeling useless
Invisible to the world
The undecided truth  I am the pretender
Living the lie concealing the truth  the great deceiver
Known to all men life consumer the one unseen
Your soul and mind under his will of power
His abuse of people touches the very core
Weakend souls captivated by his seduction
The naked truth is in disguise
Suffocating in your own remorse
Fearing the unexpected
Suffering taking a form of it's own
Through isolation being alone
It manifests and takes control
The reality unfolds
Unaware about the surroundings
A life under enslavement
Following the shallow
Morbid thoughts that dominate
Always confined in the dark
No rays of light no land of mark
Feeling that I'm going blind losing my mind
Do you hear these words I say
Deceit confused
Abused a vicious circle
Life of decadence
A battered soul
Your reality creation of evil
Manifestation of fear
Witness the madness
Inflicting pain on others
Innocent people dying
Human sacrifice
People mourning for their losses
Carry the lost
To the cross so many broken hopes
This is genocide
Words they preach I can not relate
Driven blindly by their faith
Testifying acts of hate in the name of God
Are they justified
Justified to take lives
Catives inside their web of lies
Wrecking the sanctity of life
Harvesting our excellence
Only to destroy twisted obsessions
Dark words of power
Incantalations from the script
Twisting the message revenge is bliss
Human failure we are not God
You mortal fools
Blinded by faith turning the message of love
Into hate paradise will not be reached
By taking a life
Fearing these words there is no release
By suicide
I cannot relate
By their faith acts of hate
In the name of god
Corruption taking the place of justice
Mockers of believers faith
This mental scar forever engraved
Human values are degrading
A premonition for their future
Under subjection of the fallen one
Blasphemy depravity complete denial of Christ
In difference is your excuse
And ignorance your refuge
Your twisted personality
Senseless is your reality
Evidence of abominations open your eyes
It's an actual fact this mental scar
Forever engraved existence of abominations
Don't close your eyes it's time to react
Who sees the forgotten ones
Can you tell me any difference
Were just  not the same
One step closer to the madness
Absolute behaviour  in the name of science
Emptinessfeeding their souls
The fall of man is now at hand
I've seen the sky turn black
The faces of a thousand fallen angels
Streets littered with decaying bodies
I've looked into the eyes of death
And held tight to her lifeless heart
Walking through dark and dreadful halls
Searching for a reason of being
Knowing there's more to this vision
More than eyes can see
We know the end draws near
So we fight We fight through the night
Thrusting the sword till the first sight of light has come
The dark angel falls face to the ground for here knows his defeat
We've been held down too long by the struggles of life trying to be what was never intended to see
The hand of death grasps the earth
As the faith of the strong melts away
This blackened sky tells the fate of a fallen generation
And the earth shakes for its birth pains are strong
Dig your heels deep in the soil and wait for your final stand
For we are in the end of time
The ground bleeds
Oh the filth of man kind
Can things ever be made right in this sea of regrets and shattered dreams
One can only hope for new beginnings
New beginnings
In a cold and lonely world
We face death everyday
From the womb to the grave we are destined to face hard times
There's only two roads
One we can choose
Which shall it be
From the womb to the grave we could be servants yet we choose to be slaves
Like a cobra's deadly bite
Or the forbidden apple's seed
We take the bait
What a crooked web we weave
As children search for a father's hand
Yes some do receive
And some only denied and placed in this world all alone in the night
We all know that from death we were born
And to death we shall return
Can we not show compassion
Can we just open our eyes 
There is still time to change
Before we DIE
Let's make things right
There is a God
There's more to this
In the night he waits and watches with eager eyes
Seeking to drain every last bit of life from this vessel
From this sacred heart
This blood thirsty beast
He's like a starving vulture
Everyday his eyes are on us
Yes his eyes are on us
There is nowhere we can escape him
A man's life is but a fog
It's gone without a trace
Lost behold the minds misconception
Lives are overtaken and battles lost when the sword is dropped and the lazy hands begin to fold
He still creeps closer
There is no more time
There is one who seeks to kill us
Rise and take your sword in your hand
Face the night
Take back the blood that's been shed
With vengeance
With anger
We will avenge the blood of the fallen
We will avenge their blood
My eyes are numb
My mind is so tired of thinking about the things I've seen
I've been looking for somtheing real
Ravaging the gutters of my soul
My Soul
I refuse to step in line yet these walls seem too tall to climb
Ravaging the gutters of my soul
My Soul
Always being told what to do
I will not follow the dead
Faces of the fallen
Blank stares and they're claiming they know the truth
Playing it safe is not the life I live
I search for something MORE than just a crutch
To truly see is to be BROKEN down to nothing
God have we fallen THIS FAR from what is true and REAL
Take this hardened world and shatter it
May we feel the pain you feel
Too much time has been wasted on meaningless things
It's not about comfort
It's about LIFE
It's about life
This cancer it grows in the heart
Without knowing it's existence
Unaware of it's intentions
Walking daily in selfishness
Ignorance of the truth
Ignoring real life
It only brings death
Rotting from the inside out eventually we will die a horrible death
Hatred softly creeps in like a cancer and destroys us all that we wish to be
And all that we thought we knew
We knew nothing
Inside I feel it reaching out
What can I possibly do to push it away
Help me push it away
God save me from a life of bitterness and pain
From a hate filled grave
There must be another way to make it though these hard days
God help me make it through this pain
Peel the skin back
Expose the heart
Let's see who we really are
We hide behind fake smiles these rotten minds
Blood stained hands tell no lies
As darkness falls and the huntress hunts seeking out the innocent
How many more must fall victim to the lust of man
Living in such a time as this many will grow numb
Let me not be one who sits back and watches the world waste away
But we can be more than the world says we can be
I will be more than who my father taught me to be
I will be a man
We must face these demons
And spit in the face of fear
We must stand for who we are
This is not the end 
This is where new life begins 
Lost in the annals of time long past over
Deep in soil shallow and unkempt
Brothers and sisters in ground hallowed sacred
Their blood this earth we will consecrate
Their eyes once boiling with life
Their hearts bursting with passion
With dreams they carried forever
Through days that promised the world
Then came the black winds burning
The beasts with fire in their hands
The execution squads surrounding
And their children in pieces at their feet
and who stood watching
From El Mozote to Amritsar
From Nanking to My Lai
From Srebrenica to Algiers
From Wounded Knee to SabraShatila
From Tiananmen to East Timor
From Warsaw to Darfur
From Guernica to Halabja
Their spirit lives in defiance of it all
Graves of our fathers vanquished
Entombed in their furrowed prisons
Soldiers programmed show no mercy
Following their orders from tyrants that hide behind politics
and the world stood watching
Regret nausea and rage
Never Again was the phrase
Lest not our conscience we betray
as we stand passive in our guilt
At dawn he rides the fleet sets sail the tanks will roll when Mars screams
Across the world our children wake abandoned offspring writhing there
Choked by the hidden hand of God
The swansong is on his lips an albatross hangs from his red neck
The doves are dead the hawks are free to propagate the burdens of empire
What eyes have seen the world
From wellworn knees
Where corpses lay at soldier's feet
Conquistadors  God Speed
The Prophet and the angel
Inside his oval lair
She whispers to his empty head
Conquistador war is peace
As infidels in Eden's garden we'll tear out the serpent's eyes
A class filth infested the heathen of the Holy Land 
We'll trample stomp and segregate them
Their God is deadinfected they're rats within our shrines 
Conquistador why would I lie
Have another drink of wine
Toast it to the terrorist
You're brothers in each other's arms
Doppelganger's in distress
The clash of the fools he arrives
Blinded and faithmartyred
Cleansed and reborn
As the suicide crusader with the passion of Christ armed
In the shadow of the crescent moon
The crucifix shines in its petrol graveyard
In what God's name shall they rule
the Cowboy and Caliphate in love with each other
Their dumped along the coastline on a silent East trade wind
Then appearing if by magic in freightlined bins
From labor market hell straight to wellworn shelves
Would Jesus shop at WalMart if the crosses were on sale
Things upon blessed things
In idolatry where death is worshiped
Cash cured sins in this fetish of the object holy
Still you put your love in idols built by mortal man
Now what did God say in that old testament
And what about those workers in exotic Chinaland
They have your daddy's job and you're next on the corporate outsource plan as serfs born to serve your Lord in command
Now our border's the place where the grace of Christ ends
It does not apply to those heathen abroad
As long as they slave I'll have them to thank 
It's more cash in hand to spend at the mall
Woe to the children of God
O Suffer thy misguided ways
you've sold your human essence to the cold world of dead and empty things
You're sold
Looking in from the outside
Each city pukes its wounded forth
A world that time forgot
Along 95 from south to north
From gray to greener lands
To exburb suburb inbetween
Some choke and some breathe
A fact of life in this plutocracy
As the best of the worst plan our lives
A mass murder of the spirit cuts the vine bearing wisdom's fruit
Brother wave your trust in faith goodbye
When it's man against man the culture consecrates the code of spite
So this is the ideal system 
Millions shunned in urban tombs
Easy for the rich to suffer
As they smile wave and lock their doors
Driving away from the failures
So trivial and so normalized
Back to their pristine pastures
To forward and secure their perfect lives
This nation bloodbound with its ties
Gives not a fuck for its children or the toils of their wasted labor
Flood pouring gates open wide
Upon this fiction of a state and the excess it expels and justifies
Ghosts in concrete veils haunt Katrina's winds
Gasp as charcoal air fills lungs as black as tar
And they drown
Outside your gated homes
The world begins where your street ends
Yet in time your demons will come crawling back
Praise God for what you have in life
For your wealth is as hollow as the heart you hold inside
A nightmare in three dimensions
This opulence embraced by man
Reapers of the peasant's harvest
Gorging on the fat of the land
Caged in worldly mansions
Picking vassals out from the poor
Worship at the altar of avarice
Where Bourgeois man is born
As dead men walking spoiled earth
Who spend their shining coffers dry
With thirst never quenched nor quelled
You ever think to question why
Outside your window of comfort
It's like night of the living dead
For each dime you bleed from another
The stench of your poverty spreads
Defining the world in equations
Commodity prices and fees
You see other humans as cattle
To service the gluttonous beast
A werewolf's banquet
Of ostentatious parody
Masquerading fortunes
Amassed through servility
As you eat them alive now meet your slaves
Gomorrah caving in on your precious homes
Four walls falling fast
Anachronisms piling high on memories decayed 300 days have passed again and here I am nothing's changed
Burning time the specters of a past life lived
Another year to wallow in the bitterness of loss
Recast into this languid mold
Back to a state of Thermidor
Entranced by the reminiscence haunt
But what could have been now is gone
The detritus of days long past lie shipwrecked 'cross my ocean floor
Where laughing ghosts echo of halcyon days I knew before
Demons breeding demons in my head
Is this how the book of life ends
Dead drunk dejected and unsung
Left with no purpose but to grieve
And far are the cosmos that twist and unwind
A lefthanded path into the black
As youth dissolves quickly and tensions divide
I stand frozen on that day I left
A circumnavigation course adrift lost and compromised
Navigating mental seas balkanized 28 23 17 and 33 each era brands its stigma scar
The stare of Medusa the death in my eyes
Numbing reflections from senses deprived
Walking out onto streets of blight and misery
Where strangers glance then quickly look away
With eyes that speak a thousand words in one
From weathered faces lined with years of pain
Gorgon gaze entranced what is real in this land of lives exiled out beyond the pale
To eat the gruel and scraps of yesterday's false conquests
Reliving each act in hollowed atrophy
Tasting pleasures of the flesh in absence
These countless ways we sacrifice and lose
To live in stone entrapped ensnared unblessed unloved then die
Welcome to the other side to be a face in the crowd unknown
Where we all sing along to the tired same refrain
Fed from birth for what it's worth on gray cloud dawns and black sky dusks
Doom
Born under black skies with no expectations
We crawl through our paralyzing pantomime of life
Awaiting resurrection the great unwashed seethe
In quiet desperation we accept our condition fatally
Is this the present
Can we call this life
And for the future utopian dystopian or death
Thirty million voices slogging through the undergrowth
As islands in prosperity they fuel it with their blood
In total separation they scavenge for their daily bread
Forgotten citizens a class in themselves lost at sea
Is this the present
Can we call this life
And for the future utopian dystopian or death What have they worked for
these dreams in the gutter unspent
Desire traded for dearth
And Hope for destitution
As eaters and eaten break bread
They learn their trades in time
But the teacher must be taught just as well
And as such this tragedy unfolds
Line by line the artifacts spilling across a western world awash in imagery and apathy entrenched
we dine together in here on stark immiserating axioms make our beds dig our graves
bled from this cold irrationality onto the corpse of a world
we never asked for
And through all our failed attempts we still proclaim our opinions law
One small step into life and your taken
Taken by a storm of fear
You can't stop the fleeting of the years
I sing a song of myself through the gaze of Narcissus
A reflection of inert violence
As your average American crusading in the name of man
My reality is life in the backseat riding into foreign lands
In my million dollar box of regret
I'll spread disease to protect it
My reality is life in the backseat
Gorging on the blood of nations gluttonous as I eat myself alive
Heed the call of the Suicide Shepard
When they jump I know I'll follow
Is that our echo screaming down from the tower now the martyr is your pilot
The Captain is in his quarters the Navigator's throat is slit
A 7mile stare with your eyes on the deep feeding from their trough full of sheep
Proclaiming your opinions law
As your average American always doing all I can
My reality is life in the backseat spiraling into the gyre
With me my brand old weapon It's called my clenched fistLay down with stinking dogs fucking
In oiled shit let sleeping Gods fry
Lung butter and bad soul cancer
Rat piss and wipe out the sky
Rat piss
Pick the blister she's fucking pneumatic
Bathe in piss and lick yourself clean
To some people Tom Traubert's God
Piece of shit will soak up the sea
Rat piss
Ripping the shit where's the cunt to rule
When years of boredom lead to God reaver
No fucking point it's all been done before
Light the blue touch paper and retire
Listen to me kid you're just something to eat
Just drink the rat piss eat rat shit and repeat
Don't fucking say it you piss soaked maggot
Maintain your distance don't speak
Don't explain don't engage don't justify
Just drink and forget
Don't try to share don't want to hear it
Take a step back you cunt
Just drink your acid keep your mouth shut
Stare at the mirror and cry
Don't tell me you're sorry there's no fucking point
Nobody cares what you've done
Eulogise pain  we don't want to know
Nobody cares you're alone
So cry your heart out conceited shit
Bite the pillow and think of your home
Choke your tears back you snivelling prick
Need someone to understand
Well you're on your fucking own
Synapses firing blanks on black plastic sheets
70% solution and feeding once a week
Had the chance of thousands but didn't have the fucking guts
Heroines and heroin stab her in the eyes I've seen enough
Smoke drown in brown with her I'll see her again soon
Spewing powder knees wasted bone grinding on bone
Fully conscious irritant there's skulls in the mud
What price is freedom when sickness is all we want
Unavoidable
Trenchant
Valetudinaire
Trepan
Funeral for Mr Gone
Sucking grey at his wake
I've heard that thousands could die
And she's not slowing down
Fucking obsessed
Meaningless
Days out of sequence
Bad health
Paid in failure
Daggers and honey
Blistering the eyes
Picking at the scabs
Funeral for Mr Gone
Just blood and matted hair
I've heard that thousands could die
But then there never was a point
Populate and island just like Dr Moreau
With fucking freaks and wankers
Shit they're all in the know
Cock sucking grin can't get no goddamned sleep
Dirty fucking sluts done dirt fucking cheap
No rhyme or reason  fuck you know you're alive
Writhing in your stinking nest
And where the fuck was I
Fuck
Fuck
Sharp as a razor
Fuck
Fuck
Soft as a prayer it was fucking obscene
Come all ye fuckers you can all take a turn
God knows it's warm inside
And now's your chance to fucking learn
Drunken and belligerent still water is just too deep
Come join the colony by dying in your sleep
Caffeine burned skin vinegar bastard benzos
Malicious wastrel politics scabs for eyes
Usury dislocation self abuse with pride
Mutual disrespect hate thy neighbour as thyself
A floorboard investment fraudulent use of credentials
I've always wondered how you'd look
In your wedding dress
All light crowned with stars all the best things are fragile
Guess I'll never know
Anger mismanagement a course of medication
So what if you're borderline be the best meat you can
Think this was a one way trip
An animal distraction
Murdered children have more choice
While you're skull fucking the eunuch
A world from hated sex divorced
And have no memory
Suck the cock of forced attrition
Swallow Satan's burning chyme
And have no memory
So with burning piss teared eye's
Open wide inhale the flames
Just drink away the regrets
Have no memory
Afuckinggain
Withered lunatic
In Jack Daniels' halo
Confused and violent
Abuse once and throw away
And so now you're coming fucking back again
Just drain all you need and walk away
I won't remember anyway
Give up you fuckers
Reek of fags booze and deceit
Lies written all over your body
Cunt written all over your face
Piss for blood shit for brains
Got fucking DTS shaking hands shattered pride
Remember you've always got yourself to blame
Piss for blood shit for brains you fucking cunts
Dead reference dagger eyes
Brain tumour cross
From hero to zero in one easy fucking step
Piss for blood shit for brains
Phenomenological psychology
A deaf mute cunt
Blood brains and bollocks
Time of your fucking life
Incapable player in a cast of millions
Fuck it up guts burning yet again
Live on adrenaline and fear of defeat
Fear the cunt who takes the prize
Sweet nausea knowingly expectant
Fucking laugh you fucking joke
Disjointed and obscure
Don't spill the beans just fucking watch
Just imagine the shining wall
Can't take it just want to be sick
Take another drink and smile
In front of the face
And pray for 38
Lay yourself down son and watch the gathering crows
Face of the Goat in the Mirror
As Once they Gazed upon the Hillside
Searching for the Memories
Eyes Burn like an October Sunrise
only seen by the Kings
upon the Thrones
In the Shadow of the Horns
of the Dawn of the First Millennium
Cleansed like the air in the Night
In the Shadow of the Horns
World Without End
we've become a Race of the Cursed Seeds
for five United Forces
the Kings that held their heads high
in the Eternal Dawn
The Triumph of chaos  Has Guided our Path
we Circles the holy Sinai  Our Swords Gave Wings
Invisible force of our Abyssic Hate
Weeping by the Graves of the Glorious Ones
Our seeds Boil as we gaze upon the New Millennium
Clouds Gather across a Freezing Moon
so the hardened Frost Melts Away
I kiss the Goat  Witchcraft Still Breathes
To the nines
Prepare myself fro drowning
Anytime
I made my own world
Losing it
I rob myself of everything
Destroying my body and my mind will fail
I drawn to the sound of broken glass
Drawn to the taste of broken glass
Stillborn again
Enemy
I see my own reflection
Look at me
I made my own wounds
Live alone
Survive in isolation
Poison my body and my mind will failUpon raging waves
Beneath grey clouds
Far from home
we're sailing south
In the name
of our gods
The darkness of the depth
stare at us from down under
But the gods over our heads
keep their wathing bands above us
Upon raging waves
we sail our ships
And we look back
against the north
that we long for
We step ashore with a thirst of gold
The sound of steel make us strong
Soon we've reached the aim for this journey
Wealth to all our men
Upon raging waves
Beneath blazing sun
We're sailing north
with the pride kept
in our hearts
Born like a true hammerchild
I was along time ago
Dubbed with lightning and steel
in the sign of the ravens
Cold nordic winds
sweep across our land
with air
breathed in the sky
Under the wings
of Odins messengers we live
Carrying on our nordic blood
from fathers to sons
In the sign of the ravens
our hearts still pounds
To the might of thy hammer
we are eternally bound
In the sign of the ravens
our hearts still pounds
To the might of thy hammer
we are eternally bound
Strong ancient spirits
gurdes our way of living
with scenes
seen way up in Valhall
When the horn is blown
we will stand united
in long armoured lines
ready for the eastern treat
We shall fight beneath the sky
as you fight above
We shall all be willing to die
in the sign of the ravens
Over mountains and rivers
Over valleys and creeks
the spirit of our forfathers sweep
Past plains and forests
Past the clouds in the sky
the shadow of the ravens flies
Shadows
Shadows of the past
Shadows
Of what once used to be
Shadows
Shadows of the past
Shadows
Vanishing to be just a memory
Through land after land
Through the grass on the meadow
the breath of the elderly still blow
Beneath the sun and the moon
Beneath the stars way up high
the ancient oaks reaches for the sky
Shadows
Shadows of the past
Shadows
Of what once used to be
Shadows
Shadows of the past
Shadows
Vanishing to be just a memory
The moons pale light falls over the trees
and they cast their black shadows
over the snowcovered heaths
Behold this land embraced by frost
Life and fertillity forgotten and lost
A mirrow of ice upon the lake
I praise this land of ice and snow
Snowstorms whining among the trees
I praise this land where freezing winds do blow
Fallen snowflakes in the starlight
lies silently and still
A lonely wolf barks in the winternight
Behold this land embraced by frost
Life and fertillity forgotten and lost
A mirrow of ice upon the lake
I praise this land of ice and snow
Snowstorms whining among the trees
I praise this land where freezing winds do blow
In the forest of moonlight
the secrets of ancient battler are hidden
But in the northern lands
the memory of the brave still remain
Between the trees at the meadow
the sounds of war still echoes
In the grass at the meadow
the blood still flows
In the forest of moonlight
the secrets of ancient battler are hidden
Forever they are lost
At the meadow in the forest
all of them died by sword
to step into the neverending fight
at the hall of our lord
Runt kring vår stuga småjävlar sluga
tassa så tyst med bockfet och svans
Varulvar yla isande kyla
sveper i dimma fantygets dans
Bäva och broder lyssna och hör
vrålen från gast som osalig dör
Döden han skrattar flaskan han fatter
svänger med den tills dagen gryr
Gastar och spoken skymtas i kröken
dodingar släpar ruttnande lik
Benrangel skramla spökhänder famla
kväver din strupes rosslande skrik
Helvetets alla fasor slåpps loss
fan rider runt med hela sin tross
Döden han skrattar flaskan han fattar
svänger med den tills dagen gryr
In a time now long gone
wise mans hands
was carving stories into the stones
all over our land
Stories carved in stone
To last for eternity
The runes speak of forgotten times
forgotten times of the elderly
A time when man stood up strong and proud
not afraid to fall for the almighty
Warriors from the north lands
sailed east for wealth and glory
Their destinies immortalized in stone
from which we are told these stories
In the age of the ravens
men bravely gave their lifes
to the high ones in the sky
to be brought up high
Stories carved in stone
To last for eternity
The runes speaks of forgotten times
forgotten times of the elderly
A time when man stood up strong and proud
not afraid to fall for the almighty
Warriors from the north lands
sailed east for wealth and glory
Their destinies immortalized in stone
from which we are told these stories
Runes  everlasting
History  evertelling
The frost comes hand in hand with dawn
It turnes all lakes into mirrows
reflecting the moon
Freezing storms of snow
come let me feel your purity
Freezing storms of snow
may you whine herefor eternity
As I walk throng the frostbitten forests
I get enchanted by the harshness
alive by the chill and allmighty
by my solitariness
There is not a more
as far as the eye can see
Frej god of seasons
Let this forever be
In this desolated land I am everything
Freezing storms of snow
come let me feel your purity
Freezing storms of snow
may you whine herefor eternity
Let me be enchanted by the harshness
alive by the chill and allmighty
by my solitariness
In this desolated land I am everything
Where the moon in the solitude shines
Where the owl has it's nest
Where the spruceforest lonely whines
there I will find peace
Over every log and stone
the fog lies
In the cold and pail light
of the moon
the wolf barks at the sky
Where the moon in the solitude shines
Where the owl has it's nest
Where the spruceforest lonely whines
there I will find peace
To this untouched primeval forest
shall my spirit forever belong
Here shall I die in solitude under
the tones of an elvrong
This is where my spirit
forever shall be
As my senses evolve I need to learn to stand my ground
I am forced into a shaking world when all I need is safe and sound
I am not satisfied
Looking into a mirror but I don't really think I need to reflect
I am unrealistically happy although I know it's just a state of neglect
I am not satisfied
As the fire burns I'm standing still I'm paralyzed and cold
Watch my dream unfold
I am practically liquid and although I'm breathing I am dead
although I'm breathing I am dead
I am second in line when all they needed was number one
I am sitting in the corner of that circle they placed me in
I am not satisfied
I don't mean to disagree but it just seems that I am lost in situations that 
won't ever turn out in my favour
I might just give in
It just seems that I will always live my life face down
And Still I am not satisfied
Did you not make me take the blame for you
Did you not take me for a fool and then you made me cry
What did you achieve blood/hate I believe
Watch as I deceive you in hell
So you lived your life on a level of indiscretion which Ive never seen
Your ignorance makes my silent anger just wake up and scream
It's bloodstained
So in all this hate the suffering it makes me go insane
Twistin and turning to avoid the burning that is this pain
So you would like me to go down
Face it I won't let you win this game
So you spit in my face
Still I get up and scream
Is that all that you got I got more for you
Your past will catch up with you so why not take a chance now
So you blame it all on the use and abuse of your sad power
But I'm sad to hear your arrogant excuses as I break you in your finest hour
So I say did you not fuck it up did you pay when your greed just wouldn't stop
All that time did you ever think of me
But in time I will make you understand Ironically I will make you understand
You will violently learn to know my name
I made you and your hate to socialize in a matter that suits me fine
So while I breathe in you punched my teeth in
I tried to explain it but you just you just don't see
I I see right through you
So you do things mainly bad things Is it to satisfy your own neurotic needs
I got this feeling I'm just dreaming but just make sure I'm awake when you punish me
Come follow me to that place where we both see what happened to you I need 
to see if it's all true Confide in me
I was blind but now
I see right through all that you do but though I see you I know you're not 
here with me and still I try to explain to you
How your presence is affecting my state of mind
Oh suck me in inside myself
I want to taste myself
It drags me down your dismal past
And all you want is to make that last
Don't want this its true what they say
Ignorance is bliss I'll find another way
In my mind it's all good now
I don't do things that's abnormal
They'll take me and put me away
Listen to me when I tell you I'm not insane
I I see right through you
He's been told that he can't do wrong to a lonely child that cries in his 
song to understand the mans depravation but to him an invitationso
He came in the child turned its head and its a sin how his eyes looked all dead then
What he saw the fear on his face could wait no more Heartstabbed and disgraced
Double crossed
That's a double cross backstabbin doublecross heart stabbin doublecross 
his pain and his loss
In his eyes was the recognition of a nasty face whose hurt and mission has 
fucked a life of bodily prison
It's consequence of a sick mans visionhe
Made a move the gun went off and he changed the mood into blood coloured madness
All he saw was the shadow of a grown man n flesh was raw as he fell down again
All he ever wanted to be was that man
Did he ever stand up and see for himself
Never wanted that intimacy nor that fear
If he would only reach out to me I'd show him life
And that I can't stand you make me sick
Have you seen the tears that the boy cries
Have you seen the pain that he wears inside
So alive the pain ensures that he really feels like a part of the damned
Such a bitch joy and smile are long gone its just hate in small child rape landhe's
All locked up in a room with his devil it's all fucked up
He's going down in pure revenge so he saw how his best friend helped him 
study and the score justice done a dead body
Wont you wait for him wont you wait for him
They took all he had what's left is all in his head
What the fuck is wrong with you
Depressed again or just gone insane again
Don't know what it is but I can't stand it anymore
I'm strugglin to cope Showing off again See my scars and tattoos
I wear mine on the inside A constant annoyment in a moment that already 
scares me and everyone else
Is that what you want A concentrated glass bowl of despair panic and sorrow
I fuckin wear mine on the inside I still need to ask a question though 
because I fuckin need to know
What's your definition of arrogance Is that what's shining through
Try to break me down I'm immune to your disease
Look into my eyes and the take one step back please
Execute deception All pathetic and depraved
There'll be no exception as to where my words are engraved
No relief an everlasting mind in peace
Reality doesn't hurt me but it will hurt you again
Pain inflicted sentence convicted I don't need to see this through
Easy solution made from hard confusion I think you know the end
No relief an everlasting mind in peace
Reality doesn't hurt me but it will hurt you again
Conquer the same old past I don't regret that anger it seem to last in me
You say I'm sick I'm just confused to why my mind seems so abused I'm not
I need to take on myself Only to teach myself
Is that's what's hurting you now I will be hurting you now
No matches as my eye it catches your unable to see
No regrets I'm taking all bets all arranged by me
In time you will see truth
You know I can be like that man you can't see Guess what's hiding in me
It's that thing I stole from in sickness I know you'll clean this blood off 
my business and embrace me
Now you can't stand it don't ask me to
Help just cuz you're stranded I don't want to
You know where you'll end up not in my head
Screamin and alone between the naked and the dead
Souls are lost in my kingdom
I've waited to see what you could bring
You'll fall
You'll fall into my possession then you'll see
I'm Judas in black and I love it
You'll fall into my hands where's your ripcord Hate me
Feel deceived and hated thought you would make it hold that glass and 
break it pull that smile and fake it
Sit up and spit up
Really wish you would wake up
Souls are lost in my kingdom
I've waited to see what you could bring
I'm heedless as I take you in
And feed you my mind and sin
The purest of all black and damned souls
Now I've claimed what was yours and I will use it as I damn well please
You'll see me coming but you won't feel as I enter your body and rip out the 
real you
Inside you is me
As you act I breathe
Guess what's up my sleeve
Insight
It's hard to forgive a man who bought revenge with his soul
A vein injected with a man's life and his goals
It's in my face it hurts and I fall into a hollow sphere
Well I don't want that to happen to me
I don't want to see what my face might be
Damn your shameful lies as my conscience it dies
Stop and listen as silence roars out in the night
One can't fake that anger and oh it's shining so bright
Is this my fault I will light it up to see I will light it up
I don't really see I don't want to be Is this my fault
I don't see inside of me a moment turns to infinity
I don't want to see what my face might be
Damn your shameful lies as my conscience it dies
I just might hurt you my friend
All that was left for me was destructive in misery
I blame you for all that I did it's eating me bit by bit
How can all this be true I blame it all on you
Electrocuted with a sense of loss Anxiety will see me through
Flipping through the pages of a mind that hurts me
Sometimes I wish that I could eject from this seat of pain I'm fuckin 
placed in and let it go
You tell me what you think of me and my sense of energetic rage compiled 
into a ball of anxiety
Do I need your help Do I need you
Blood on the walls it embraces the fear that goes on in his mind as he cries out
Into the dark room he don't control and don't see and don't choose to see his work
He won't hesitate for a minute to reach for everything he ever wanted
He could be that star he could be the one No complications when the game is won he sees
City lights in an instant he's going to light the night into a fire
As he turns them down with a pitiful look blessed nitroholic in a pickup truck he burns
He burns
Stand or fall Anger says it all
Dance to his groove Moral on the move
Animallike and he knows it still he covers it up when he shows it
He's got time to spare as he's turning it up No hesitation as he's ready to drop he screams
Undefined and somewhat normal still he's not aware he is mortal
He's got eyes that glow with a beautiful light a mechanical spin roaring in the night he burns
He burns
Fuel driven to expand memories burning in a mindlike tin can it's hard to see
Mechanical addict a drug of choice somatic/dynamic it turns into an institution
It's hard to forgive blind perspective Evolve to conceive machine of beauty
Veins bleedin blood red electrified Human yet still bred Full automatic
Concept of mind
Anger grows in time Dance to his groove Moral on the move
Out of his mind for a minute it seems like nobody is willing to let him 
spin it With a pounding heart in a body of steel The mechanical spin with 
a mind at the wheel
He sees the
Light I can See Turn it out in me
Wasted time to be what you wanted from me

Bigger and stronger we're ready for everything
Playing and screaming we're preaching what we believe
Harder thicker and longer that's how it is
We don't five a fuck about what people say
We could not care less
'Cause that's the way it's meant to be
That's our way yeah that's our way
No way we will never turn it down
Our way we call it Monster sound
No way there's nothing they can do
Our way Monsters on the loose
In your veins you will feel the rush of adrenaline
You just feel out of control insanity
My brothers EV and Stone are here with me
We're ready to kick your ass you'd better believe
And here we go again one two three four
Never ending energy the roar of a thousand screams
The walls are sweating heads are banging losers on their knees
Feel the wall of sound we are Monster and we are proud
Come on Monster let's show tem how the big boys do it
Hours of work searching for the right sound
Hours of journey we're travelling from town to town
Sleepless nights all mother fucker in our way
It all doesn't seem to matter we just want to play
They say that we can't make it
That we're just a fraud
But I say let them talk then
The time will prove they're wrong
So let the games begin
And you will see us win
That's it Enough with talking
Watch and learn with us
We came to the battle
With our swords axes and stones
Knowing it will be us against the world
Let's fight the good fight
They say the contender
Will beat us anyway
But I prove that we're stronger
The arena is our place
So let the games begin
And you will see us win
Let them buy the audience
We prefer to do it our way
We came to the battle
With our swords axes and stones
Knowing it will be us against the world
Ready for the battle
We're sword X and Stone
Knowing it will be us against the world
Let's fight the good fight
If you wanna fight with me
We'll see who will lose in the end
The story never ends yes here we are again
I've seen this scene before and it's happening once more
There's nothing for you here but you have to appear
You always talk too much so I'll tell you what bitch
I hate bastards full of shit
Shut your mouth or taste my fist
One more word and I'll tie you up with an entire roll of duck tape
Shut the fuck up
That's absurd what's a jerk liek you doing here
I think I'd rather have been born deaf
Than to hear your voice bitch
I'm trying to concentrate just trying to do my thing
But everywhere I look there's someone just like you
If you have nothing good to say please don't come my way
You just bring me more problems so I'll tell you what bitch
It's funny how I can perceive
The smell of mediocrity
I see some movemente in your lips
But nothing good comes out of it
The simple fact that you're alive
Must be a shame for all mankind
If someone like you crossed your way
Then you would understand that
You should have been born dead
Yes I know what you've been through
All those lies he told to you
But you know I'm not that kind of man
So I don't want to have to explain
Every little move that I make
Don't want to pay for his mistakes
You have to work it out
Every time I talk to you
Is just like I'm not being true
I'm sick and tired of being the villain here
That's the last time I'll pretend
Pretend that everything's ok
You better trust someone again
Or you will end up alone
In every word I said I know you heard his voice
In every word you said you left me no choice
In every way I've tried to be the best for you
And everyday I died a little more it's true
All in vain
People tend not to care
With the consequences of their acts
It is all about now it's said and done
But the truth finally rises
Yes it is right before your eyes
Everyone in your life
A victim of your father's lies
I beg your pardon my dear but what I will say to you may hurt your feelings
But I've got nothing to fear cause all I'm saying here is true
Every man thinks like I do
Well they can say they don't agree with me
But deep inside they know that's how it is
When you see a hot chic pass
Take a look at that ass
Women They're mine The more the better that's right
Women They're mine Two or more at the same time
So you ask me about love and about monogamy
Who are you trying to fool my friend
Cause I saw your boyfriend watching that girls double
D's
Blame Mother Nature on it
Monogamy is a social or religious thing
I'm not religious and I don't give a shit
And then you talk about cheating
And how wrong it can be
Well if you don't want more women
You can leave them for me
I'm not cheating anyone
They're with me cause they want to
I know that they think like I do
So I'll be true to myself
Do what my body wants me to
And I'm starting with you
Listen why don't you listen
You never hear the things I'm saying you never listen
If you don't want to listen to me why do you ask me
Why do you ask me what I think
Choices we have to make them
You always make the worst choices then you pretend that
That you control the situation and still remain with
That stupid pose that makes me sick
This is your story a life full of glory but
Hey what you're going to say what you're going to do
When the mask falls to show the real you
I'm here to warn you I'm here to help you
But you're much too blind to see what is right in front of you
Just don't tell me that I didn't warn you
Yes you had heard it all
A thousand times before you just reap what you sow
I'm telling you once more this time why don't you listen
I'm trying yo help you once again
But you're too proud to listen
You always act so proud but I can't see a reason
What are you proud about You keep shooting your own foot
Your life has always been a shame
First thing I see I'm way up here
Above the clouds how can it be
I'm falling down right to the ground
There's no way to save my life
The wind is cold it cuts through me
I see the earth it's coming near
In the speed of sound I touch the ground
No time to close my eyes
Then I wake up tied to this chair
In a desert highway that's not fair
Cause in the distance I see a truck
Coming at the speed of light
I try to escape but the ropes don't break
The truck is near I can read its plate
There's no time left feel impact
No time to close my eyes
That's the feeling I always get
When I get up on the stage
I don't even remember my name
Yes I'm giving all I have to give
But that's the living that I choose to live
Give me my bass and a mike just to get a start
And no one gets out alive
I open my eyes and start to rise
Something is pushing me up to the skies
When will it end the cloudsa again
They cut me like ten knives
But I keep on climbing the space is near
That's when I cross the atmosphere
And at this stage I disintegrate
With no time to close my eyes
Your whole life is in my hands
My wish is your command
I'm in control of every step
Everything goes as I Plan
But you thank god everyday
Just because I've crossed your way
Cause without me you don't have a life
Yes I've never treated you bad
That's just another way I have
To manipulate so I know you're mine
Everything that you may need
I can give you what you please
But you don't realize my love
Nothing that you have is yours
And if you had enough of me
You can go I set you free
You have my blessings go and live your life
Cause I know you'll be back again
Begging me please let me stay
There's nothing like it to make me feel all right
That's right
I don't tell you what to do
But you do as I please
I'm your master you belong to me
You think you're in control
But you're always on your knees
I'm your master you belong to me
Any problem that you could have
Just call me I will be right there
So you don't have to face your fears
That's my way to keep you weak
Yes I'll make your life complete
And you will never blame me
For this emptiness that you feel inside
I'll command your every move
You will live by my rules
And you will thank me till the day you die
That's right
All these lies I couldn't stand it
Alibis He tried to justify
Our last chance people believed him
All in vain that's why I took this knife then I
Stabbed 'till he died what should I do
Stabbed 'till he died no mercy for his sins
Stabbed 'till he died three for five
Stabbed 'till he died stabbed 'till he died
And now you arrest me
Why I did something wrong
If you had arrested him
But I had no choice
That's why I've killed the president
Every time he's tried to apologize
Then he cried the same shit again
So I said I'll put and end to it
That was it that's why I took the knife then I
Stabbed 'till he died what should I do
Stabbed 'till he died no mercy for his sins
Stabbed 'till he died eight nine ten
Stabbed 'till he died stabbed 'till he died
And now you arrest me
Why I did something wrong
If you had arrested him
But I had no choice
That's why I've killed the president
Of what crime am I guilty
Something has to be done
All the crimes he commited
You left me no choice
But to kill the president
You know you can't blame me
What Who will take his place
I can't believe what I'm hearing
Give me back my knife
Cause my job is not completed
Stabbed 'till he died what should I do
Stabbed 'till he died no mercy for his sins
Stabbed 'till he died thirty five
Stabbed 'till he died stabbed 'till he died
Of what crime am I guilty
Something has to be done
All the crimes he commited
You left me no choice
But to kill the president
Die
I'm trying to write a love song
But the words are all the same
I'm trying to write a love song
That didn't say the same things
I'm trying to write a love song
But the music is too loud
I'm trying to write a love song
A song that would make you proud
Instead this song of hate is pounding in my brains
It just keep coming back It's driving me insane
I'm trying to write a love song
I'm not bitter to even try
I'm trying to write a love song
But this feeling in me has died
I'm trying to write a love song
But the lyrics didn't fit
I'm trying to write a love song
That's the way it should have been
Instead this song of hate is pounding in my brains
It just keep coming back It's driving me insane
Whi is it harder to talk about love now
What makes destruction so pretty
So don't you try to be good we don't know how
Cause we are evil by nature
I'm trying to write a love song
Again I'm using the same line
If you think I'm out of ideas
You don't have to think twice
People talk about anything
In songs poetry and rhymes
I'm just trying to write a love son
And I can't do it not tonight
Because this song of hate is pounding in my brains
It just keep coming back It's driving me insane
This song of hate is dedicated to you all
No songs of love here for you
This song of hate is inspired by you all
No song of love can be true
Hate
This song of hate is dedicated to you all
No songs of love here for you
This song of hate is inspired by you all
No song of love can be true don't you heard it
Get me out of this shit now
I don't need more problems
The more I try to make things right
The more they stay the same
That's how it is
Another night that I can't sleep
Another day that I have to keep on fighting to be awake
Another problem to be solved
Another hole that I have to cover with what has remained
My head is spinning 'round and round
My self esteem falls to the ground
And it fells like there's no way out
It seems like that's the end and then it starts again
And every night I say my prayers
Pretending it will help but then
My eyes don't close till 6 AM
Pressure on my chest warning me what's next
Another working day begins
And once again I have to grim like everything's ok
Another day where I have to wait to hear the bullshit that you say
Time and time and time again
The worst part is what I get
I'm always here to clear the mess
And it's always been like that
It seems like that's the end then it starts again
Another nioght the same old prayers
I try to fool myself again
It is AM I'm still awake
That's enough for me get me out of here
It's never enough don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I say
The things they do the things they put me through
Tell me Is it to late to start again
The curtain is closing
Lights are down
I'm on my way backstage
But this time I know that's all
It's been more than a thousand stages
The applause of a million hands
Yes I know I will miss this
Yes I know they will miss me
Thank you for the best times I've had
That's the end of the set
But I know as long as my songs are there
The show is not over yet
I look at all the people that
Used to work with me here
As they try to face it all
The smiling faces that I knew
Are not what they used to be
But I can't hear what they're saying
'Cause my music keeps playing
I know that every stage that I've played
Has made my life worthwhile
I know that you who've screamed my name
Will keep my songs alive
Cause there's someone that I've never turned down
And it's you
Let's go back to 1985
He was the coolest motherfucker at junior high
The faster guitar player his hair down to his knees
He used his tight jeans with a pony MVP
Iron Maiden Tshirt what more could he need
Metal Boy
If he had the right grade He could play his guitar
Cause daddy said he'd be a lawyer as his daddy was
His mummy used to buy all records she could get
But not Ozzy Osbourne he ate a bat's head
He used to put people down cause he was the one
Metal boy
Hey metal boy you used to say that you're the best
Hey metal boy now we know who laugh last
After twenty years the metal boy is gone
Now heis a lawyer like father like son
Looks like a watermelon with a suit and a tie
His wife's a fat woman that controls his life
They have a fat kid that thinks that he's the guy
Metal boy
After twenty yeats my hair is not as long
As yours used to be but I still got them you are bald
I still can't play as fast as you used to play
But I'm still here playing in a metal band
I can say with pleasure I wrote this song for you
Metal boyThey dwell beyond dimensions 
outside the sphere of a living realm 
escaping the binds of the universe
watching beyond the unknown
Immortal inhabitants of eternity 
mortal minds cannot behold 
intricate patterns of insanity 
which we will never know
Your will becomes submission to creeping dark aggression 
listen in terror the lights darkest contradiction 
besieged from all sides by this force that resides 
ruling the shadows beyond fields of sight 
subject to this madness resistance rendered useless 
as you stand alone at the mercy of the merciless
 Perceiving ourselves as endless
we choke on the sands of time 
and as we fade into nothingness 
their memory of our being also dies
Beyond mortal comprehension 
outside our perception 
creeping aggression 
dark contradiction
Immortal inhabitants of eternity 
mortal minds cannot behold 
intricate patterns of insanity 
which we will never know
They dwell beyond dimensions 
outside the sphere of a living realm 
escaping binds of the universe 
watching beyond the unknown
Gazing back now at the living 
from behind these eternal flames
as judgment day has passed 
with darkness I bind my affinity
Their kingdom bleeds 
their kingdom falls
 Suffering in vain disintegrated 
destined to serve powerless 
engulfed by the infernal consuming pain 
armageddon draws near
Sift through the ashes of your deranged crusade
you weave hypocrisy into faith
destiny of flames the choice I've made
ashen skies have come to life
culminating storm of centuries
plumes of smoke have filled the light
the doom of all life
Structure that guided the way 
cast upon irrelevance 
a crown of thorns that now decays 
lustful vows of decadence
as the world in its insanity 
powerless to resist the end 
an outlet for the killing force 
draws upon the end of time
Their kingdom bleeds 
their kingdom falls
Years have passed
still the one remains
sole survivor
of a world in flames
world of flames
Last of an endangered breed 
lone survivor of this tragedy 
solitude inherits humanity 
doomed forever to obscurity 
echoing memories of those deceased 
tear at the remnants of sanity 
within the mind of the last to be
Through rivers of ash that layer the ground 
search for life never found 
cannot be yet one survives 
contemplate this worlds demise 
dead haunt the living until it dies
Towering wave 
consuming flames 
A shattered world 
in the wake of this storm
Can you comprehend the strength of the enemy you have made
overpowering cravings for vengeance driving me insane
false assumptions of superiority has brought you to your knees
as you beg for mercy you will not receive
failures realization rips the smile right from your face
folding in submission you are erased
It shackles my soul this obsession
drawing strength from opposition
it boils the blood this aggression
 Trapped in this web
you should have left alone
your feeble struggle
strengthens the ensnaring grasp
Can you withstand the unleashing of rage coming your way 
wrath like none confronted before this boundless hate 
imminent is this destruction blindly await annihilation 
impossible to evade
these victims of fate
could have turned and walked away
choice no longer yours to make 
waging war until none remain 
it shackles my soul this obsession 
drawing strength from opposition 
it boils the blood this aggression
They fall like flies
crushed under onslaught of aggression
corrosive mind
lashing at your resolve in waves
manifest hate
endangered morality in regression
no end in sight
volatile force chemical reaction
Repulsive actions burning impressions on the soul
Cascading wave of failure relinquish all control
The grasp of terror crushing a fleeting sense of hope
and then the same hand closes a casket for the soul
This affliction will finalize your sanity
To descension encompassing your very being 
Suffocation within the tomb behind 
the eyes of a being aspiring to its demise 
Termination forsaken for the suffering 
which embraces every fiber of your living being 
and disposing the withered remnants of a man 
in a tomb constructed for a tortured mind
Drained of all sense and reason 
Your very soul devolves 
into a state of grotesque 
Human deficiency
Behold the seize of power 
Dark faction now prepared to strike 
All opposition bleeds and cowers 
Legion of darkness shall dictate its will 
and rise to power
Denounce all gods and moral structures 
crushing to dust the bones of those who question 
The power of our convictions 
The world has never seen such horrors
Eviscerate all false believers 
Incinerate our social leaders 
Kill and rape those who seek the light 
on virgin blood we thrive
Remove the tongues of those who speak out
Tear out the eyes nothing else is seen 
Cut the throats and let them bleed 
on human life we feed 
Rise To Power
Rise To Power
 Ageless hands of a wicked race 
Malicious fury of hell forged hate 
Clawing with rage out from below
Uprising realms of sickness grows
Mocking our doomed existence
Surrender to visions of a hopeless future 
Prophecies foretell the end of time 
Alliance of poisoning hate deployed 
Implications of a dream that died 
Visions Of Violence
From the wastelands of a mind gone mad
Foreboding dreams of a world to come
Chaotic visions now known to be 
haunting images of destiny 
Ageless hands of a wicked race 
Malicious fury of hell forged hate
Lives trained to fear 
Fevered visions forming inside 
in darkness swarming on mankind 
Burning embers fill the sky 
Transforming those left alive 
Earth below now bleeds 
consuming fire glows beneath 
engulfed atmospheric cage 
a final act has now been staged
Surrender to visions of a hopeless future 
prophecies foretell the end of time 
Alliance of poisoning hate deployed 
implications of a dream that died
Haunting images now known to be 
Chaotic visions fill destiny 
Nightmare becomes reality 
Twisted forms of chemistry
From the wastelands of a mind gone mad
Foreboding dreams of a world to come 
These visions become violence
With open eyes
No longer tortured by sermons of lies
Watching it die 
Faith crumbles as the angels they bleed
 Losing grip on reality
Behind the shield of crumbling faith 
Now the mighty have fallen 
Left alone to suffer their fate
Religion is lost in spiraling descension 
Ending at last the reign of the divine
The world opens its eyes
No longer paralyzed by sermons of lies
Broken chains of deceit
Faith of absurdity faces defeat
This wrath becomes your ruin
From Wrath To Ruin
All things past and void of life
And all things yet to die and face the light
Must come before kneel and be driven down
Before the lords of emptiness
Abysmal Gods abound
Horror anguish fear and torture
Souls devoured at postmortem 
Empty beings power unrivaled 
Dissolve existence effortless control
Screams of suffering
Have no effect wrath unbridled
Fury unrestrained entity of darkness
Feeds on pain Cries ring empty
All mortality purified through pain
Merciless control Abysmal Gods now possess your soul
Horror anguish suffer fear and torture
There is no salvation
Souls devoured at postmortem
Empty beings control this power unrivaled
To resist is useless
They dissolve the existence of all things
Victims of a dying world 
Succumb beneath a wrath of terror 
Oblivious to the awaiting doom 
A never ending rain of lire consumes
Blind they sleepwalk the path of lies 
Offer prayers to an empty sky 
Wasted effort only made in vain 
Weak are tortured in endless pain
 When darkness falls 
Blind illusions deceive us 
Hoping for a non existent savior 
While we alone are strung enough
Victims of a dying faith
I have now grown to hate 
and forever turn my back
to the lights weak embrace
Darkness once confined within 
demon absolved no longer bound 
dark forces controlling the mind 
spill forth onto realms of light
Victims of a dying world 
Succumb beneath a wrath of terror 
Oblivious to the awaiting doom 
A never ending rain of fire burns
Blind they sleepwalk the path of lies 
Offer prayers to an empty sky 
Wasted effort only made in vain 
Weak are tortured in endless painYou wanted to feel me 
you wanted to take my life 
so come on and fuck me 
come on and waste my time 
you wanna be near me 
you wanna destroy my mind 
you wanna corrupt me 
so come on and save my life 
every one of these people i've known 
if only i could remember their faces 
if only i could forget yours 
cause i never wanna see your face again
Do you remember a time when we were young 
a special time and a place under the sun 
and if we had it again would we make it last 
cause special times in our lives burn away so fast 
Do you remember a time when we would laugh 
under the stars and the moon upon the grass 
and yeah we knew it would end but we had no care 
cause we abandoned our fears and we walked on air 
Have we lost those times 
have we lost our minds 
cause i wouldn't do it over again 
i think we've lost ourselves 
and everything that we believed 
and we don't care anymore 
just like the way it used to be 
Every word upon my lips is cold and burning me 
every word i say is burning all i see 
and i feel it 
and i feel it all the same 
Just like the time that i can't forget 
just like these days that i regret 
it's killing me all over again all the time 
it's persuading my mind to forget 
Do you remember a time when we were young 
do you remember those times when we had fun 
do you remember at all what it meant to cry 
i can't remember it now 
because the memory has died
would you say that it's like this forever 
if it could only stop ever 
it's just the way things turn out 
the way it always is 
and i can't forget this never 
we see it all in such different colours 
we see it now that it's changing shape 
the violet in our eyes the violence in disguise 
the shades and the shadows that we all see as our own 
it's the violet that we all love to despise 
i am my own am i alone 
am i alone 
i am my own i am alone 
but everything is violet 
there's nothing at all we can do to change this 
now that everything is violet 
just forget about this 
just forget about me 
we'll just suffer individually 
we'll pretend it's alright 
can you pretend it's alright 
can you really survive this misery
into a dark despair i see you turn away 
are you alone at last is that the only way 
i came to see the sun i came to see the sky 
i came to watch the world that makes you cry 
i'm looking out of the window looking for your anger 
i'm looking out of the window searching for your anger 
beware the hours that pass into a thousand days 
if you can't stand it here why do you stay 
you'll never see the sun you'll never see the sky 
you'll never touch the world and come alive 
i'm looking out of the window looking for your anger 
i'm looking out of the window searching for your anger 
i'm looking out of the window and time is running faster 
i'm looking out of the window searching for the answer 
just like you
to see you again to hold you in embrace 
to feel hope again to hold it and embrace 
the memory of your eyes the memory i've sought 
but i won't find it ever cause all that's left is lost 
you stood before me 
and i forgot to breathe 
now those days are gone i'm hurting everyone 
but i can't take back all i've said and done 
so now i lay here restless alone i am distraught 
i've chosen my own ways and all that's left is lost 
i wish this pain would leave 
i wish i couldn't breathe
whispered melodies and a sound of your voice 
traverse thru my mind and leave me with no choice 
now it's tomorrow the days have turned to grey 
with it your absense that made you feel this way 
and no one knew what you felt would hurt us all 
no one knew you but they're all here to watch you fall 
angels in your words open my mind 
i'm overcome with sorrow i'm overcome by time 
now it's tomorrow the days have turned to grey 
with it a promise that made you turn away 
and no one knew you what you felt would hurt us all 
no one knew you but they're all here to watch you fall 
to watch you fail
A time that's for myself i know just what i've done 
and there's no reprieve so i'll always run 
awakened from the dark i hold it in my heart 
the secrets that we keep my aching soul must sleep 
i know just how you feel the way i'm fucked up here 
but still i can't reveal the emptiness i fear 
i cannot find a way i think i'm past that day 
where there's no return when will i ever learn 
i'm holding on i'm holding on 
to a hope less broken 
let's watch the days go on forget all that we've known 
and as the sun goes down you'll laugh at all we've done 
just drink it all away you'll forget every day 
and as your life goes by you'll laugh until you cry 
i'm holding on i'm holding on 
to a life less broken
I see you falling down tonight 
i see you coming near to hold 
oh did you feel it was surreal 
i see dark strangers coming near 
you cannot be afraid 
you cannot be afraid tonight 
i see you turning down the lights 
illusions complicate your sight 
oh don't you see it's so unreal 
i see yourself feeding your fear 
you cannot be afraid 
you cannot be afraid tonight
She brought the Night hidden in her sad Wolf eyes
The perfume of a twilight her strongest scent
Half Wolf Half female  what a strange wedding
Mother Nature has offered us to see
Her mask lays lost in a fatal dawn
Closed were the eyes of the Sun He sleeps
And in the name of Her Father
She will kill My child kills
You nightly birth A requiem God can't forget
For your life is just a celebration of his death
Without his thorns in her heart She wears a shadow as face
A werewolf masquerade In her eyes the wolfshade
She brought the Night and by the night was brought
We are but children of the powers she had set free
Strange are the ways of the wolfhearted
Vampiria you are my destiny
My only Love and true destiny
Vampiria
You're a beast evil one
Above your head lays a Star
In your heart is buried the jewel
Of a Serpent who wished to die
Your red long tongue has her poison
And you will spread it as you breed
In unique transylvanian ream
Conceiving the creed of all creeds
Vampiria fly Vampiria
In your eye burn defying
All those who in silence sleep
In a city once named Desire
Dreaming with the entombed dear
The lady has fallen in a blossom
Spread far away by undesirable winds
To females conspiring in gloom
Hiding your pearls from the pigs
So open your arms
They were shaped as wings
A serenade of revenge draw on your lips
The sombre hill you're staying in
Is now defined
And your Star had start to shine
Depart now on your bright wings
The world envy
The skies have always seduced you
Precious Queen
And you know your time has come
To fly away with Me so far
Mother Tongue speaks to Me
In the strongest way I've ever seen
I know that she sees in Me
Her proudest child her purest breed
She speaks to Me in colours
That I can't really understand
I only know that they are ours
And to those I'll proudly bend
For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the Power within
For I am your only child
And you my dearest mystery
World can't you see it
Am I alone in my belief
Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente ss
Gloria Antiga volta a nos
ALMA MATER
Breaking waves announce my Bride
It is the only way the Sea could sing
Legends of Lusitanian pride
He sings the words I cannot spring
At the Moon Mountain six wolves cry
Your lost glory we'll regain or die
For I am her only child
And she is my dearest mystery
Pagan Gods in conspiracy
For the sword of Tyranny
Mother Tongue has spoke to thee
In the strongest way they've ever seen
World can't you see 
I am not alone in my belief
ALMA MATER
Virando costas ao Mundo
Orgulhosamente ss
Gloria Antiga volta a nos

For I am her only child
And she is my dearest mystery
From an ancient throne I defy the world
To kneel before the powers within
For I am her only child
And she is my dearest tragedy
World can't you see it
I am not alone in my belief
Virando costas ao Mundo

Opium desire or will
Inspiration bound from an elegant seed
Subversion through smoke I foresee
Erotic motions of lesser gods in ecstasy
Opium bring me forth another dream
Spawn worlds of flesh and red
Little jewels of atrocity
Opium I sleep in debauchery
And burn with you
When you burn in Me
Opium we fantasize
As we fuse with your root
You are a strange flower
we are your strangest fruit
Opium it burns in me and you
Opium it burns for me and for you
Por isso eu tomo opio é um remédio
Sou um convalescente do Momento
Moro no rés do chão do Pensamento
E ver passar a vida fazme tédio
I remember her as a child
Ravenon and on with her raven claws
Carvingon and on with her raven claws
How she lusts when she remembers
The night of her first blow
She always wanted to know
How far could she really go
Inflamed a deadend room
Seduce to consume
NightsilenceVampireEmpire
Statues with open wounds
The flavour of poison and moon
Still maturing on her blood
She is not your occasional affair no
But eternal love drop by drop
Ravenon and on with her raven claws
Carvingon and on with her raven claws
How daylight hurts when moonlight bites
She juggles with her invisible knife
A black bird senses danger and flies
Gives peace to a tall figure in the dark
Little silhouette snakes find
A warm nest behind the door
And whiptongues and skins
Of sisters now gone
Bodyprints cover the velvet floor
Which grows red and red
They know she will hunt and hurt tonight
And they crown her Queen of the Dead
Ravenon and on with her raven claws
Rapingon and on with her raven claws
Will she weep for them or whip them once again
We are wolf memories
That tear the skin apart
Wolves that once were men
And shall be them again
We are wolf memories
That tear the skin apart
Wolves that once were men
And shall be them again
Or perhaps memories of men
Who insist of not tearing for to be wolves
But that never shall be them again
Somos memórias de lobos que rasgam a pele
Lobos que foram homens
E o tornarão a ser
They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light
To blind you and me
Full Moon Madness
We are as one and congregate
Full Moon Madness
We rise again to procreate
Somos memórias de lobos que rasgam a pele
Lobos que foram homens e o tornarão a ser
Ou talvez memórias de homens
Que insistem em não rasgar a pele
Homens que procuram ser lobos
Mas que jamais o tornarão a ser
They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light
To blind you and me
Full Moon madness
We are as one and congregate
Full Moon Madness
We rise again to procreate to seal our fate
Irreverence was cast out from the sky
And eternity lost its sex forever
And under the same heaven they voted to emptiness
They still celebrate under a Full Moon Madness
They awake for flesh
Choose pain as a path
Refuse a light to blind you and me
Irreverence was cast out from the sky
And eternity lost its sex forever
And under the same heaven they voted to emptiness
We still celebrate under a Full Moon Madness
Crawl me into your second skin
And teach me everything
Second skin
Through your eyes a voyeur
Through your veils of a visionaire
Talk to me about those things
No other soul would care
Outcast all the colours that I still have
Camouflage me so I can fall and stand
Somewhere between an underrated angel
And all those citizens marked with an XSex
Second skin
Tissue apart and right to the heart
Teach me the wonders of your moral blade
So I can stand still while you have to kill
All that was yours before and now has to fade away
Draw me the fine line between religion and crime
You are one more son of God you can never be wrong
But aren't we all
As we sit and wait
For the serpent to bite our very own tail
As I sit and wait
For the serpent to bite my very own tail
Second skin
Have you ever loved a woman
Who should be that little intruder
In the one that you should be
Share the snake with us
Swallow the snake for us
Have you ever loved a woman
Who instead of give or take
Would seduce you with a trade
Share the snake with us
Swallow the snake for us
You have learnt heaven through impure lips
So different from what you have been told
So different from what you have seen
And now that you learnt you will have to release
The tender arms of a woman
Which would have strangled you to let you live
You will have to elect the fainting arms of this cross
Which are just killing you to let you live
Share the snake with us
Follow the snake with us
I am only real at places I can not be
My right hand rebels and chops off the left
the hairy ape walks into stage
He tries to stay erect
The one who never slept
In order to be perfected
The arrogance of their hands
The joy of the regret
Soulsick good at things I never did
Soulsick but skindeep tense frantic but relieved
Soulsick but skindeep tense frantic but believed
I am only real at places I can not be
Dead liquid vigilant
Implanted into my sleep
The one who never slept
The one who stays erect
The one who is perfect
The one I do reject
Soulsick but skindeep tense frantic but relieved
Soulsick but skindeep tense frantic but believed
Soulsick good at things I never did
I am only real at places I can not be
Soulsick but skindeep
I'm not real just believed in
Soulsick but skindeep
Not real just believe it
Whatever haunts me from birth on
Is leaking white blood again
It is sickening my heart
While I divide yours in two
Lustmord I will never stop to hurt you
Lustmord I will never stop to love you
I will never stop to hurt you
Now that I have you with me
So close together in one body
I feel so safe but what about you 
The soft sweet wound of normalcy
Is sweating white blood again
I am fingering every inch of it
Grateful for who I am
You're my interruption
My crossroad of just one way
My object without a function
But so mine anyway
Unpredictable when I kiss it burns
Irresistible as a crowd of only one
I am so addicted and you are so down
You are nailed forever to my sense of lust
Lustmord I will never want to stop you
Lustmord I will never try to stop you
Help me fall from grace
Need you to be Incomplete
I am the impostor at your feet
Is it your first time
Or have you been tempted before
Downward into the pulsing life
Laying below
Try firewalking inside of Me
When everything else falls apart
Won't you fall from grace
I am at a wingbeat
From my retreat
Is it your first time or have you been tempted before
Downward into the pulsing secret
Laying below
Try firewalking inside of Me
When everything else falls apart
High heels of crystal
Stuck in the heart
Daylight that heals
The fullmoon scars
Spider strategy
And the wish to be
At one with me
Throughout the fright
It is so real
So full of light
when Nocturna steals the night
Sister of cain
All our breed slain
The youthful oath
Remains the same
Le mal de vivre
That never ends
But the hunt for you goes on
Throughout the light
It is so real
So full of light
when Nocturna steals the night
From the soul to its waste
The Common hates his evil twin
Everything invaded
In its simplicity
How did you get inside me
Still all fascinated
Invaded by everything
In the first morning light
The touch of death covering skies
Everyhting invaded
and All the fears inspired
How did you get inside me
Still all celebrated
Invaded by everything
Everything so full
In the lives I have taken with Me
All our moments wasted
All is getting in
Still all violated
Divided by everything
And all the grace disturbed
All existence false
All your dead generations
I am a son of yours and I am coming back
Everything invaded
In its finality
Tell me will it hurt
When you get outside of me
Everything is breaking
Why have we ever stopped here
Everything invaded
I am a son of yours
And I am giving up
Everything invaded
Invaded by everything
Snowbird ablaze and hurt
Brighter fearless just like a runaway
Princess neverasmile
Oh child What makes you try
Crying and sobbing
You greet the other day
She who never touches ground
Spreading an eclipse
Where never the sun shines
At her feet
Frostbite Astray Will Faith
Haunting hunting she rules the game
Twin soul you are always a strange
Nothing ever makes you afraid
Promising threatening
She looks the other way
She who never touches ground
Spreading an eclipse
Where never the sun shines
At her feet
Starlike but never to be counted
Look at your hands child
Destinies grow back to them
Daughter sun
With nothing to say
Never a fullmoon
Just the sickening ray
Prudent
In tears hiding
No water shed
The sign of the Cross
Will take you to bed
In Capricorn
Spreading an eclipse
May never the sun shine
At her feet
The world has turned once more inside
Brought up a message from our dead
The ones you love the most
Are the ones you hurt as deep
The world has turned once more inside
Anchored into captivity
The ones you wanted the most
The ones you buried under sea
Exit wounds waterdrums dream the eternal return
Tree of life rotting inside autumn leaves winter white
A light at the end of the world
Whole world a ghost shading inside
True love waits for the bless of death
The doubt that sets me free
Not to remember anything
Stillborn bloodlet die in our feet like the trees
Earthsong neverland let the blood have its way
A light at the end of the world
Was it for this we sold our souls
Was it for this we missed our chance of leaving
for a lie at the end of the world
Bleed no reflection
Upon the waters that you fear
Make things happen
Accept no resignation
For some life has been cruel
You have set the mood
Thinking about you LunaLunaLuna
Lay the serpent's egg
In this world of make believe
And make things real
My seed of a lunacy
Was a sign made to resist
A mood set from birth
Thinking about you LunaLunaLuna
Show me your moon burns
Take me as the moon burns
The freezing moon
Making things real for me
The killing Moon
Making things happen for me
LunaLunaLuna
Luna  all above
Wound of light in the enemy skies
Make things happen for me
On the eve of self destruction
On the eve of all can beThinking about you
I stand before thee gods of all prestine
Come forth to see all things to be seen
Now know the presence and choose thy wrath
For flock of tyrants who know not thy path
Come now in sweeping vengeance
Come now in needed time
I demand as I stand before you
Cleanse this worlds decay
I demand to know the light of a promised land
I demand to see this corrosion wiped away
And the slithering begins
as the shell of men crawl weeping
and as the light of dawn is growing
the realization sets in
And with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
That the ways of the shallow empty
have brought it down
The winds that are blowing
shall bring it down
And while your clinging
to the ways of your worthless life
Your words is falling
you are left with nothing
and with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
your ways so shallow and empty
have brought it down
your ignorant haze
has brought it down
Return these days to the righteous
heal these wounds of time
I have waited so long
for the winds of change to come
through eyes still clear
through eyes not dulled by fear
through eyes behind the soul
I see what must be
I demand to know the light of a promised land
I demand to see this corruption wiped away
Breathless I stand free
blind to fates which fall to men
embracing the chilling winds still I am
the mist freeze falls from my breath
steel gray skies encompass my sight
caring not for other worlds
and there are other worlds than these
Your Fathers tried to slay me
Your Brothers fell before me
Clashing as hates collide
Through echoed cried I wade
Upon frozen ground my victims lay
Pounding the frozen earth
The hooves of horses carrying men
Swords raised high
The rush of war flowing through their veins
The warm blood soon to meet the earth
from which it came
Your fathers tried to slay me
Your brothers fell before me
Ageless Still I Am
Heathens they bring their crusades to me
Failing they've come to die in vain
Nameless their meaningfulness is none
I summon the strength of the gods
and we are one
Hear this see this know this
for this is the ways that it must be
For solace I eat the heart
to steal the power this magic holds
and to taste the bitter vengeance
that within me has dwelled
Men of kings have come to end me
only to die in vain
legends have cursed my name
spells are spoken
believed to ward me away
Your fathers tried to slay me
Your brothers fell before me
Ageless Still I Am
Awaken my brothers
of vengeance we rise
to devulge this enemy
to enlighten the ones who sleep
Worlds have passed and so too has time
my slumber now disturbed
this place of hate thy worlds shall burn
Humans I shall feast upon your ignorance
you will destroy yourselves
Mortals your slithering existence
sickens the gods my brothers
it awoke me from timeless sleep
my dreams destroyed my visions lost
and so I watch you pray
and spite your worlds
Forgive me father I am not your god
you crawl to me and beg to me my sheep
you have fallen curse your empty lives
blind like wolves you turn on yourselves
Decide between the ways of the weak
the sheep to live a lie
or to come to life in victory we stand
above the meek
to raise the chalice and toast the conquering
to feast upon the spoils that we claim
We are wakening
We are the one you seek
We are the merciless
We are the all is truth
We await the coming of days
The awakening of the eyes that sleep
The dawn of light for those of us who see
to stand above the shattered flock and their lies
for now it is our time
We are the conquering
We are the one you seek
We are the merciless
We are the all that is truth
Victorsnow hear me
Victorscome now know your name
Brothersas it must be
In victory we stand
Our wake our secret is broken
Our legions now are one
The time of the silence now ended
In victory we stand 
we are the conquering
The clearing out the storm
Omniscient are the eyes that see beyond
what we choose to see
transcending of beliefs that limit man's being
the dogma that feeds the listless
has thrived uncounted years
impeding on ones perception
of what is to be
Awaken to see
A god of a desertion
A god of lies
enlightened by a way deceiving
only truth to the blind
the salvation that you seek is empty
no god of light
the venom that has fed your faith
you except with ease
but the sights that lay before you
destroy your beliefs
Awaken to be
At One with Nothing
Now all will be seen
the seeds of the weak destroy
the lies told of forgiving exposed
the ignorant thrown to the wake
your calling names of gods
they are only shrines
the waves of the truth enslave
slaying the blind
Awaken to a light of knowing
all your truth was lies
and the faith which you embraced
has left you blind
deceived like the fools that surround you
it came with ease unfulfilled were the days of your being
but now you will see
These chains that have choked existence
have fallen away
this veil that has blinded eyes has been lifted
and now it is gone
and like the ways of the sheep
the flock has been to only receive
led to the gates of their enemy
led to the slaughter of their beliefs 
and now their gazing eyes have turned
turned to see us laughing
these fools who have thought
us to be as they are
have never truly seen
guided by limiting the ways that they think
they thought us blind and obscene
but now the sheep are wailing
cries to a god they never see
and as the gates are closing
down upon the all they have believed
and now their pleading eyes have turned
turned to see the eyes of the laughing
the ties have bound these fools
to the ways of the blind
is ignorant bliss
lies that were fed to the slumbering mass
they've grazed upon it
and all that awaits men failing to see
is the sight they've despised
the gates have opened
your religion has died
Secured limitations
you created this thing you call sin
A guide for the undisciplined sheep
through the pain and denial the pleasure reaped
a freedom contained within a shell
and all that's without you call hell
You scorn our existence
Unclean despising our ways
Shall the unclean come and infect you
For our ways disheveling your hold
and the random perplexing the fled
Behind the walls of concrete they hide
Secured limitations
From uncertainties the godmind knows
and from the nothingness all the wines flow
The affluence themother's gift
but you can't through the concrete
You scorn our existence
Unclean despising our ways
Shall the unclean come and inflect you
For the heathens have chosen a different light
and the vision of the all through the inner sight
For the freedoms and prisons are in the mind
Secured limitations
From the uncertainties the godmind knows
and from the nothingness all the wines flow
The affluence the godmother's gift
but you can't see through the concrete
I am the void of light silence I am the dawn of time
I am the all you see emptiness I am the non
I am the air you breathe treachery I am your wine
I am the soil and seed mundane I am the in between
taste of my knowledge
come bleed me weak
of my force feed
drink of my power
breathe of the mist dine upon divinity
from the earth and wind
our return is now
forever and now again
our voice is one
voice of the ancient ghosts
now your chains are stripped away
I am the void of light silence I am the dawn of time
I am the soil and seed mundane I am the in between
taste of my knowledge
come bleed me weak
dine upon divinity
from the earth and wind
our return is now
now the chains are stripped away
I've seen visions awakening
drawing timeless life to an end
I've felt forces pulling me
and I have rejoiced in them
I've heard voices calling names
I have reveled in their beckoning
for the voices that summon me
have grown immense
my senses keen with desire and pain
senses heightened by my need to see
to feed the hunger that I feel inside
awake my soul to ecstasy
my father the forsaken
the king of blasphemy
they cower at your name
they live in ignorance
they hide behind a doctrine
that has taught them only lies
now let them see
thy world immaculate
I've seen visions awakening
drawing timeless life to an end
I've felt forces pulling me
and I have rejoiced in them
I've heard voices calling my name
I have waited for their beckoning
for the voices that summon me
bring the gift of bliss
For many centuries
killing was so inhuman
and continues being
the true thing that there's
no equal rights
courts full of hypocrites and bureaucrats
condemning innocents leaving them with
No sights
The fears is so much
that the authority can't touch
assassins walking on the same streets
among victims
how life is so cruel
Nowadays there's no dignity
the Plague installed in our city
the time has come
judgement day we say
fight for your rights
don't let your life be destroyed
by some asshole that points you a gun
telling you that it is
so fun
judgement day
condemn the guilty
and not the innocent
judgement day
the electric chairs
were made for them
judgement day
Always the doors in your mind
imaginary forms of life
showing the holy one
twisted versions of reality
Confused  I know that I am
disappointed with the man
confused  I know that I am
disappointed with the man
Will they put a mask
I feel hate I feel depressed
pushing into the deepest agony
I feel hate inside me
O vento leva meus males
a chuva lava meus prazeres
eu fico nú na alma
a natureza me devasta
o mar não me acode
o tempo me castiga
Olho o céu encarnado
sinto a brise peregrina
a levarme escondido
Entre a fome que é minha
tempestade tempestade grito alto
já é tarde muito tarde
vou indo talvez em sonho
talvez talvez sozinho
I feel my eyes hot
My head is burning
I feel my eyes hot
My blood continues running
Strange and unknown felling
Odd visions images
Journeys into inner self
Where am I roaming
I still feel that fire
Burning in my chest
My old and awful scars
In contrast with a bird in its nest
Time passes as the wind blows my life book
Pages of guilt anger and tragedy
Summer's sand blow into my hot eyes
I really don't know my state of reality
I really don't know my state of reality
The strength of awful visions
Invading my conscious
The fire conquests
My supposed future promises You don't believe in God
I don't know why
you have so much doubts
but you still want to try
you are subdued
you struggle your way through
The real thing is that you don't have no command
you can't understand you're existence
but you try to find the man
Shout you ignorant
seek the sensation
in what do you believe
You're a ship without a sail
so close that you got paled
so close
Living on the unreal
never showing the face
nothing you can't touch or feel
protecting the human race
immortality in the key
the secret of your treasury
tell me what i need to be
immortal to eternity
Gods of eternity
looking for a place to be
resting for humanity
covered by their mystery
Gods of Eternity
A burning hell  this world
flames  from inside
showing  the end is near
humanity  covered with fear
Coming from every part
called by their dictators
To defend with the heart
transforming us in predators
Then comes the time
that the slaughter begins
covered with dirt and blood
no time to confess our sins
Unequal rights
they start up the fight
obeying our leader
the anger grows bigger
in what kind of society do we live in
in a society of greed
cruel hate
no faith
Unequal rights
their must be a logical explanation
of all this killing
this is our situation
of all this killing
Eles ouvem silêncio profundo
ficando sem saber se ouvem o mundo
não escutam vozes mas seguem passos
passos que só por poucos são achados
eles ouvem o silêncio profundo
olhando para a cidade infernal
barulho vibrante e todo o seu mal
eles dizem que o que vêem
mais dói do que a vista supera
eles ouvem o silêncio profundo
que quem ouve não ouve
e sentem dor na vida por aqueles
que não conseguem ouvirThe faces of the figureheads
Are there to fear them but
The money bells are ringing
For those who hear them and
The seeds of your future
Await for you to sow them and
The sound of your voices
Will ultimately show them all
The ways you will matter and
Perpetuate society
The days you will shatter to
Bring you notoriety
The rules you'll be breaking will be rules for fools and
The pains you'll be taking will be your tools and
Make your own way
In this life
Have to find a way to rise above
The pain and strife
Make your own way
In this life
Have to find a way to rise above
The pain and strife
Piles of bodies and bodies
We see them and
Some that didn't make it
Didn't choose to be them cause
It's hard to make a mark
With a plague of illiteracy
But sitting on our asses is a
Form of complacency that
We can't sit by and tolerate
We have problems to eleviate
Bad education and suppression
The homeless in the street
Are a few of the nightmares that we should
Wake up and greet to
Make your own way
In this life
Have to find a way to rise above
The pain and strife
Make your own way
In this life
Have to find a way to rise above
The pain and strife
In this life and there's only
One of them
There's a means to an end but
Unfortunately some of them
Destroy the things that we need
Like the creatures in the water and the air we breathe and
Then we wonder whose fault it all was
Well maybe not yours but that's not it cause
We take for granted the things that make our life complete
So open wide your eyes and
Get the fuck out on the streets
Make your own way
In this life
Have to find a way to rise above
The pain and strife
Make your own way
In this life
Have to find a way to rise above
The pain and strife
Into his flesh the knife cuts
Inside he wants to survive
Surgeons working hard to try to keep him alive
He's only fourteen years old
Beside the bed a cop sighs
Don't think it's fair he's too young to die
Pulse slows and then his heart quits
Doctor's try to shock his life back
They're unaware that in the street he sells crack
Bullet hole through the kidneys
The man who shot him understood
If he could turn it round I'm sure that he would
In times of greed and hate
One must evaluate
The cause of all this pain
Social problems stay the same
In times of greed and hate
One must retaliate
The truth is never plain
Understand this is the strain
Tried to reach society's standard
Have wealth makes you a good man
Not in the wrong he just wants to fit in the plan
Teach our kids of wealth and power
If you happen to live on the wrong side
Got to live a life of crime just to keep you alive
Today morality has lost
Everyone's reaching for the top
We can't change the world if a bullet can't be stopped
In this age we've lost all our values
And maybe nothing can suffice
If it's true we'll crush ourselves in a self destructive vice
In times of greed and hate
One must evaluate
The cause of all this pain
Social problems stay the same
In times of greed and hate
One must retaliate
The truth is never plain
Understand this is the strain
Today's another hopeless day
Downtown surrounds
Cohesive thoughts cannot be made
The light it fades
I raise my head up to the sky
Don't care can't fly
The army forces altered me
You pass me by
Not hard to see
My system used me
High potency
Interrogated from the government seat
Manipulation
Mind exploited until complete
Hallucination
LSD into my system
CIA experimentation
The real world has slipped away
Illusions never fade
Not hard to see
My system used me
High potency
Not hard to see
My system used me
High potency
They're making you believe
That what they sell is what you need
Your decadence starts your decay
Bullshit lies is what you've seen
Censorship on the screen
This is your window to the world
You work  you spend
This trend will never end
Why don't you open up your eyes
The truth  they hide
No doubt the news has lied
Why don't you open up your mind
This ain't what life's about
Dislocate
That ain't the real thing
It's a fake
I don't beliefe a word
Deviate
Have it your own way
Consuming all we can
Wealth and stature make a man
Unto this screen you are a slave
Images of what is in
Controls your mind until the end
This is your window to the world
You work  you spend
No time to make amends
Into a wonderland you're hurled
The truth  they hide
Of wars when lands collide
Is this your window to the world
This ain't what life's about
Dislocate
That ain't the real thing
It's a fake
I don't beliefe a word
Deviate
Have it your own way
Faster than the earth is turning
Looking up my eyes are burning
At night alone I'm walking
Black cat clever stalking
In the grotto impatient waiting
Before long I see your face and
Whisper a word of greeting
Secret lover's midnight meeting
Chill wind our bodies biting
Whipping round like bolts of lightning
Full moon to some is frightning
Senses reeling pulses tightning
In your arms passion rising
Looking deep into your eyes and
Body movements hypnotizing
Scratching biting screaming crying
As I'm raised out of my body
I'm looking down from above
To be rather than to seem
Eyes meet no word is spoken
Bruised backs and bodies broken
Sitting back the pipe we're token
Bullets shot barrels smoken
Hot sweat our bodies gleaming
In our heat and passion steaming
Laid back to sleep I'm sinking
Of the nights events I'm thinking
As I'm raised out of my body
I'm looking down from above
To be rather than to seem
As I'm raised out of my body
I'm looking down from the sky
To seem rather than to be
Someone take this cold from me
And let my mind run free it used to be
Easy to deal with the everyday shit
Now it seems I'm all alone to deal with it
Take me away from here
Falling away
Falling away from the fear
It seems too near it feels too real
Have to find out why
And cut this cancer from my life
Falling away from the fear
No one there to hear the inner cry
Only I can watch me die inside
I live alone among a crowded world
I can't forgive myself this weakness
Sets my pride to burn
I can't believe I find a way
To make it through this hell everyday
Slip slipping my reality slips away
Sleep sleeping it seems the only way
Take me away from here
Falling away
Falling away from the fear
It seems too near it feels too real
Have to find out why
And cut this cancer from my life
Falling away from the fear
Now it seems there is a way
To shed this pain from
My brain and walk away
I found an ally who is
Strong as I
I need no other to get me by
Inner me inner me I am he
I and I set me free
I must control the pain
Just for another day
Take me away from here
Falling away
Falling away from the fear
It seems too near it feels too real
Have to find out why
And cut this cancer from my life
Falling away from the fear
No one to hear the inner cry
Two stars collide in space
I see it clear
Star dust upon my face
Why should I care
A far off hidden place
I visit there
It makes me feel safe
Stops the despair
Help me find
My way out
Can't believe
You've no doubt
Just killing time
On nothing we depend
Shattered hopes  for the moment
We amend
You know you look the same
As my old friend
I can't recall your name
Or where you've been
You cannot take the blame
For thoughts you send
And you can't play the game
Around the blend
Help me find
My way out
Can't believe
You've no doubt
Just killing time
Until we meet again
Guaranteed  disappointment
In the end
Now that I'm feeling downtown
Like never before
Now that I'm folding my fingers
Ready for war
The painted face of disaster
I search for more
I light another cigarette
Swallow the poison glossy eyed
Dressed in fire with empty words
It came as no surprise
The people conversating
Beyond all will to listen
The people will stand in lines
With great high walls between them
Coal black hair china white doll skull
With amber slit eyes
Bittersweet with a razor tongue
See through polished lies
The dim light is bathing you blood red
Adrenalin shock
I light another cigarette
Swallow the poison glossy eyed
Dressed in fire with empty words
It came as no surprise
The people conversating
Beyond all will to listen
The people will stand in lines
With great high walls between them
Looking through star dust illusions with faraway eyes
Pretending they know and understand
See through the disguise
I light another cigarette
Swallow the poison glossy eyed
Dressed in fire with empty words
It came as no surprise
The people conversating
Beyond all will to listen
The people will stand in lines
With great high walls between them
Into the grey sky
Blackness is blown
From this great machine breathing smoke
Hammering pistons
Churning of gears
Furnace of coals remain stoked
Roar of a turbine
Scream of a jet
Man's dream to learn how to fly
Mimicking nature
Study the wind
Travel on air through the sky
Progress comes from the will to learn
Conquest stems from the greed of man
Can't fuse science with hatred
Can't fuse
Advance not with destruction
Proceed defying corruption
Gain ground keep moving forward
Gain ground
Towering structures
Steel and stone
Built on the land that we kill
Burning our forest
Draining our lakes
Forward progression our will
Splitting the atom
Power to threat
Evil we hold in our hands
Frighten our neighbours
Pointing our guns
Until they reach our demands
Progress comes from the will to learn
Conquest stems from the greed of man
Can't fuse science with nature
Can't fuse
Advance not with destruction
Proceed defying corruption
Gain ground keep moving forward
Gain ground
Never happy never pleased
maybe not what you forsee
These cats don't know what's up
Passively observing it all
Put you up on a pedestal
Try to make you larger than life
But how can you be down
With your head high in the sky
Stand my ground
Won't back down
Keep my integrity
Never compromise
Say what I believe
Won't be pacified
Stand my ground
Won't back down
Yes we've been around
Sound surrounding is sick
Staying underground
Not on an ego trip
No we won't pay to play
It puts no food on the table
Except the old promoter
It buys him a billiard table
All these people sucking blood
It's a wonder we don't run dry
But music's in our blood
It's not like they don't try
Stand my ground
Won't back down
Keep my integrity
Never compromise
Say what I believe
Won't be pacified
Stand my ground
Won't back down
Yes we've been around
Sound surrounding is sick
Staying underground
Not on an ego trip
Woman here no money there
But she said she's help me out
I better get some cash some day
Of that I have my doubts
Make me sick make me cry
If you con't compromise
But we have our beliefs
And our pride so realizeYou were walking on the devils' trail
And the end is extremely fucking near
I will look down
I will look down
I will look down to your corpse and smile
I'm running out of bullets
I'm running out of bullets
I'm running out of bullets
In every corner and every alley
Another place to hide
You're running through the city
And I can smell your hair
I followed you into your house
I put a gun straight in your mouth
And that was the end
You begged me Don't kill me
You were walking on the devils' trail
And the end is extremely fucking near
I will look down
I will look down
I will look down to your corpse and smile
I'm running out of bullets 
In every corner and every alley
Another place to hide
You're running through the city
And I can smell your hair
I followed you into your house
I put a gun straight in your mouth
And that was the end
You begged me Don't kill me
Begged me Don't kill me
By the time the lights were turned on
A thousand bullets are in your heart
It's not enough it was not enough
I'm choosing a weapon to kill you 
In every corner and every alley
Another place to hide
You're running through the city
And I can smell your hair
I followed you into your house
I put a gun straight in your mouth
And that was the end
You begged me Don't kill me
I followed you into your house
I put a gun straight in your mouth
And that was the end
You begged me Don't kill me
Rib cage made of broken bones
Cuts and bruises glass and stones
My jealousy on your passenger side
I hope it died I wish you died too
I can't forget your scars
When when you crashed your car
At 100 miles an hour against that wall
You're the only one who
Makes me forget that I will die too
This city is a graveyard
I whisper dreams into the dead
But they don't see it
I see you shinning to me
Like a candle on the river
But I'm sure we will die too
Rib cage made of broken bones
Cuts and bruises glass and stones
My jealousy on your passenger side
I hope it died I wish you died too
I can't forget your scars
When when you crashed your car
At 100 miles an hour against that wall
You're the only one who
Makes me forget that I will die too
This city is a graveyard
I whisper dreams into the dead
But they don't see it
I see you shinning to me
Like a candle on the river
But I'm sure we will die too
Heaven clouds collide
Under our will
And I have to saw
Those corpses
To get you out of there
I can't forget your scars
When when you crashed your car
At 100 miles an hour against that wall
You're the only one who
Makes me forget that I will die too
This city is a graveyard
I whisper dreams into the dead
But they don't see it
I see you shinning to me
Like a candle on the river
But I'm sure we will die too
And I'm sure we will die tooI can think of a thousand ways to kill you
but none so cruel
as keeping you alive
Ghastly horrific grandeur
symphonic decadence
violent strings
distorted tunes on crippled wings
So you og 'round and around
to this such a frightful overture
a carusel of insanity
and the clowns of the show are us
Spread the great plague
and death reeking with splendour
rattle your puppet limbs
to the orchestra's song
A masquerade ball
to which you have been summoned
a gathering of the demented
The clowns of the show are us
the mad conductors
of the horror grandeur
you have gor the resemblance of a pig young man
and you shall have peace
the prospect of death
and the hope of hell
the comedy is over
Assailed by ever returning nightmares
silent as a moths wings
yet cruel and violent a dwelling place of demons
and other seemingly more tender things
But their fragile appearence deceive
they come they come it calls
surely worthy of my outmost fear
ragged little dolls
Tiny little feet tiny little hands
tiny little still heart
shiny stearing marbled eyes
Who goes there come forth
from the shadows let me see
trembling with fear but still that is my wish
because no dream can ever hurt me
In the pale moonlight a most hideous face
laughing hysterially more and more
yet underneath a whitering reflection
of a beauty that once was there
Awakened by screams mu own it seems
and the rumbling sound
of the rain a thin stream of blood
from where her hand touched
I dear not fall asleep ever again
I should not mind
if she were done away with
killed or ploughed
she did not seem to serve a useful end
and certainly she was not beautiful
I have no time to tell you
how I come to be a killer
but you should know as time will shown
that I am society's pillar
To bleed doth cheer the pensive
and remove the raging fires
bred by burning love
Speak Was I morose
and break this bitter silence grin and sombre
shatter this fragile glas I was invisible
with the resonance miserable
of this voice undetectable
not mine nothing
or even less
Lie
And hide this painful truth you
tear the cold reality who sit upon a throne
the reptile's tongue in the ruin of my soul
with many voices I make myself
scream dreadful icons
you to worship
who steal my sight scream
and cloud my thoughts to awake the demons
allready so blurred of lunacy
by you I am possesed the beast in my blood
Alas my heart harbours
two souls
and a thied face I wear on the outside
They shed their precious tears
wept the loss of life
the absence of bright days
unable to see the beauty of death
so elegantly decayed
In long ranks they marched
surely towards peril and doom
and the orchestra played a desolate song
as they willingly went to their tomb
A miserable pack of wrecked souls
all danced to the ghastly graveyard bell
a funeral theatre a heavenly play
but the stage is set in hell
It is for creatures of divine origin
a story allready told
but still this horrid painful drama
is hideous to behold
Disease disease disease and pain
by dementia and fever made sick
Worms
o conquering worms
deep in the reeking dirt
the horror the pain
the shreak of the flesh
the loneliness of the grave
The shattering sound
of the cemetery bell
the silent mourners and the cold rain as well
ashes to ashes dust to dust
dead and forgotten flesh foul and rotten
this grave has no tales to tell
O gruesome death reaper
eyes darker than the deepest well
sinking deeper and deeper
surely all the way to hell
Bells bells ionfernal bells
in a cold black grave I lay
demons howl a crippled song
of my flesh and its decay
And one night
when the moon was full and its silver spears
pierced her mournful heart
gently up the creaking stairs
allready more dead than alive
Weak and weary
pale and cold
blood still flowing
si it is told
At the top she dropped to the floor
just outside my bedroom door
silent as a dying day
with a whimper she passed away
tis said from shadows grey
devild come to take her away
as her sin made heaven reject her
hell set out to resurrect her
born of evil and all that may dwell
in the darkest the deepest of hell
so tis told in these here parts
the devils bride she became
when hell took her heart
centuries ago maybe more
still she comes to my bedrrom doorWild wind came from the north
Brave men with bloody swords
came here to fight by your side
like a thunderstorm we ride in the sky
We're the warriors of pagan gods
northern power lives in our hearts
Valhalla is our fate
After death we'll still celebrate
we're the warriors of pagan god
Now I have to go to the great final war and I will die
but my spirit still goes on
Fight with death don't lose your will
If you win or die you're a legend
Death is like a spell
You can't resist
Now I'm cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Death has won and it will return again
The eyes of Lamia in the night
She's a cruel carnivore that's what I like
Her snakelike body is hot and wet her teeth are so sharp
Her throat is so deep so red
Every night I'll see her eyes under an old oak she awaits me
Every night I must return she knows how to satisfy me
My life is like a living hell I'm alone now until the end
My friends betrayed me but I'm not desperate if you play with me you'll lose your breath
Noone understands me I live in shadows you cant see
Pain love hate are my purgatory
I'll never change my way this is the path I want to go
Through the darkness to the gate
Fuck all religions fuck all laws I'm my own lord
No commands no promises no fucking lies
I'm a black rebel I'm running wild I'm a black rebel this freedom is mine
Take my hand follow me let's find a better place to live
Free as a bird in this world together we'll fly
In the course of time it was forgotten
This ancient crypt slept there was peace
But then somebody disturbed those sleeping demons and the seal of the crypt was broken
And an evil laugh resounds from there at night
This ancient crypt started the immortal rites
Old legends became true darkness was there soon
Passing bells sing their song the whole area is now only illusion
Hear the magic drum and the voice of the spirit
Our time has come to break all limits
Hear the shaman's word feel the beyond
He touches the sky on his way
See the iron bird in the sky
It's a form of a shaman on his way
He calls for a help and the tribe is healed
After that he came back
Rocks thud against battered bodies
One must die to see life
Take me
Strike me down
Let me bleed
Let them see
Rejoicing in what's happened to me
Let my screams attract you all
My call is your great fall
One must sacrifice his life to save his tribe
Better one than all
Captured by a lie and put to death by his own brother
Take me in
Strike me down
I will pay for your life
With my blood and my pain you will be saved from death
By my price I paid for your sins on the cross
I will purify you and give you life
My sin my shame takes its toll on my heart
Oh how I long to be pure
Purify me Lord
Take my pain away
Purify me
Daddy where are you
Take my pain away
Cover me in your precious blood
I came to this world
I bled
I will save your soul
I bled
I will give you new life
I bled
I will give you peace now
I bled
Fall into my hands and sleep forever in these ashes of sorrow
Your chains hold me down
Your words keep me bound
Death cries out from these ashes
Fall into my hands and sleep forever
Forever is so long to have to wait
Who will save your soul
You must pull your own way out of hell
It's all you have to live for
Christ he will save your soul
Life has passed you by
It's your time
Turn your eyes to the sky
Breaking glass eyes to free your mind
It's cried for so long
It's crying for something
A broken heart will free your mind
Empty sight will bring you life
Will bring you life
My life falls to the ground only to shatter and be put back together again
Renewal of my heart
A new beginning
Born of the son
Born of one
Life has begun
As beginning goes to end against evil I win
Christ has brought me out of death saved my soul
Christ has saved me from the pits of hell
Giving life once more
This time it's in your hands
I will follow you forever
Now I'm taking back my life
I'm taking back life
I'm taking back life
Taking back my family
I'm a warrior of life
I hope my words get under your skin
Stand stand up stand up
Salute Him as your king The Lord who reigns over heaven and over earth
Yea� you can't ignore it
Why it's in your head
Now you can't forget it
Why it's all been said
Pushing� it's coming
Rising laughing in my face
My head is spinning
Lord help me please
I need you now
Come into my life
The time stops
It rises
Now is your time
He suffered for your sins
He'll suffer again
He suffered
He suffered
Now I feel it racing in my mind
Stop it
You can't take this inside
Why do you run and hide
His blood it flows freely from His hands tonight
Take it or leave it
True love is hard to find
Mass murder for the sake of Christ
Time has come to live to die to pass away to burn away
They're beating me down
I feel no pain
Life inside this world has come
It lived
It died
It passed away
Now is the time for selfish annihilation
Hail Jesus hail Christ
Hail to the King
Blood covered sight
Open my eyes
Why can't they see you in this life
Life has cut me down to size
My heart is open
I can hear you calling my name
As you do open my eyes
Your life reigns
I can hear you screaming out
I could never ignore your call
Now is the time
Selfishness under my feet
Now you can never hide the pain that lies in your heart
It will push you straight to your grave
Live for the Lord and you will see the truth eternally
Deception is your name
I cried out for your hand
All I see is your foot in my face holding me down down on the ground
I fall to my knees to praise my Savior
Your eyes are so cold your hands stained with the blood of children
So you think you can hold me down forever
I will rise and fight till my last breath
You put me down to make yourself feel better
The time has come
I'll stand up
Fight for Christ
He is all I have
I will stand for my King
I'll praise him every day
Rumors of men in the night coming to take my life
They came and took your life
Rise again from these ashes and fight
Fight forever
We'll stand every day to praise His name on high
I will stand and fight forever
I will stand and fight forever more
In this life you can't take it
You're not real
You can't prove you're
You're wrong
Steadily it pumps over and over knowing only the present past forgotten futures unknown
Deep inside we all have fear
not knowing what's next scares us all
If I could only overcome this beast
It has become my life's goal
Your pills your weak minds can't heal me now
I must walk alone
Your thoughts of me they'll fade away
What's real will remain
Why all that's false rots away
Walk away from yourself
Spit in the face of all men
Turn your head up to the sky
Confront the coward that lurks beneath the shadows
Call him out
Slap his face
Walk away
The truth remains the same
Love kisses me on the cheek
Taken my weakness away
Weeping for these gone astray for the lost
For the souls I cry out to you
Please pull me through
I love you
You are my all
You came unto me to set me free
Won't you set me free tonight
I feel your love tonight
For it lies in the wind of change
Accept it now
For it may never come again
For all things change
Except his love
It remains the same
You came up to me to set me free
I love you
You are my all
Now you are all I need in this life
I feel your love
I feel your love as it passes in my mind
An ever present peace that reigns
Now is the time
Run for your life
Accept the Lord into your heart
Rise rotten corpses from your graves and meet Him in the sky
Leave life's burdens behind
I want to die
Take my life
I want to die to be alive
I can't take this life living in this lie
Come take me away with you tonight
Come take me away with you to die
Lord sacrifice me to bring you glory
Take me
Make me a warrior
I have stood your test
If I can't go home with you I will stand and fight
I've been through hell and back
I know you are the only way to life
Look in my eye and see the way to freedom is through the Son
Take His hand
He will save you from your casket life
Your church can be your casket
Show me your ways teach me to love
This world can be so cold
It's hard to find one who cares
Show me your there
Show me you care
whipe my tears away
take my pain
I just wanna Take this time to just let you know
That no matter what you're going through in this life
That Jesus Christ he is always there
He's always there to stand by your side
He's a friend that will never walk away
He's a father that will never turn his back
I just wanna incourage you right now
No matter what your situation is
Just reach your arms up and just call out on him
He'll always be there
All he wants is your attention for you to love him back
He needs us just as we need himWhat is truth I ask myself
All religions boast absolute truth
But temptation is all that I find
As flesh craves overshadows the emptiness
On through the valley of blindness I roam
As voices whisper in the wind around
Calling me into the darkness beyond
Like the sound of sirens in the distance
From the valley of the shadows
Into the darkness beyond
Feel the calling of pleasures
Overshadow man's emptiness
My guiltiness bleeds internally
Inside tunnels of blocked emotions
The silent screams within my inner being
Bursting forth in desperation
Disillusionment fades
As I change my course
Rejection of pride through repentance
The answer revealed  messeanic deity
The judge paid the sinners debt
From the valley of the shadows
Into the light of Crist
I follow the calling if righteousness
As shadows cringe from the brightness
Peace engulfs me
As I surrender my life
The entwinning of guilt is lifted away
Shadows are scattered by
The Lamb of God
Delivered from the
Abuse of substances
Wars and famines AIDS and broken lives
Drug offenses damage to bring demise
Bury the dead in their coffins
Mankind is rotting away
Global misconceptions
Lies to steal your life
Lies wars hatred Antichrist
Human condition
It is no superstition
Human condition
In desperate need of God
Privatisation selling the world away
Abolishing independance
New World Order shall arise
Bury the dead in their coffins
Mankind is rotting away
Cashless world is coming
The beast is on arise
One will rise with false hope
Seeming to solve the crisis
The man of sin the Antichrist
Bringing the lies of death
Bury the dead in their coffins
Mankind is rotting away
Look in the Bible for answers
Don't accept the false demise
Distarnish Priest
Distarnish Priest
I'm clean washed in blood
Sanctified inside out
Oh I'm dead to Satan's grasp
Justified by the cross
Vertical convulsion striven force
Grasp desired service
Hideous onslaught attacks the mind
Vicious intent prevails
Serve your God
Your time will come
Guard your heart bow before God
Sack cloth and ashes repentance
Radical conversion zeal of love
Put faith in actions
I'm lost inside your ways
I've found a new escape
This life no fantasy
New ways reality
Always growing never fading
Hope increasing peace astounding
Always knowing never falling
My salvation making me
Wretched man that I am
Chronicle thought diseases
My priestly robes must be clean
Pentinence of ministers
Bow at the altar of sacrifice
Living flesh submission
Eucharist served to others passed
Priest of life's maturity
Grind planetarium
Pride lacerated from my mind
Grind planetarium
New destroying all that is blind deceit
Mortification
Bringing forth flesh denial
Stardom farces
Capture those of false arise
Manipulation of other to
Bring about succes
Abomination
Those of flesh will see you're false
Christian warfare
Kill the stars exalt the cause
Mass exposure
Is what we want but for our Lord
A compassionate God Looks down upon the earth
As the void in man's heart grows wide
Empty human grabs at the air around
As fashions drift along through life
Chasing the wind
The emptiness will never be satisfied
While pleasure warms the dullness inside
Restoration groans for fulfillment
Within the captivity of pride
Overseer creation testifies
As pride of man holds back the helpless cries
Drawing near with arms stretched open wide
Inviting forgiveness in its place inside
Instinct persuades the will
Men like animals respond
To the calling of desire
Ignorant of the creator
May God subject them all
Our to labour on their own
When human strength fails
Then they'll call upon the Lord
Yet in God's great compassion
He floods His grace upon our soul
Mankind chooses helplessness
As pride holds back the cries
And outwardly denies it
As he closes up inside
I cry out to the Lord in my distress
He takes away the chains
That bind my soul
Let us give thank for His
Unfailing word
For He sets us free
Crush this momentary pain
Crush this momentary pain
Crush this momentary pain
Crush this momentary pain
Crush this momentary pain
Impulsation
Smash and grab world
Impulsation
Live fast die young
You'll not find real satisfaction
You'll find emptiness
Fake gratification
Impulsation
Patience never learned
Impulsation
Satisfaction now
Can't you see this won't last
lasting peace comes from Christ
You'll find selfcontrol
If you find salvation
Blood and the fire purge your mind
Ultimate satisfaction real peace
Lasting joy comes through Christ
White wash your mind
Find your release
Bludgeon to death lust in your life
Consecrate to live right
Manifest the grace of God
Supplicate prayer and love
Impulsation
It's not cool
Impulsation
You could die
Can't you see people dying
Everyday AIDS and drug addictions
Drowned in the water of the spirit
Till it follows from our gasp
Engulfed it takes our breath
Till every word flows with life
Liquid assets
Liquid assets
Liquid assets
Vital fluids
Aquatic regurgitation
Cannot hold it in
We are full of health
Can't get too much of this good thing
If anyone is thirsty
Come to Christ and drink
Whoever believes in Christ
Living water flows from him
Everyone who drinks water
Will be thirsty again
Drink the water of life
Welled up streams for eternity

ETERNAL DAZE THE ETERNAL HAZE
RECEIVE THE FAITH OR DIE THE DEATHBad addiction the evil weeping to torture
Incessant drug addiction taken by the weak
Violent ramifications
Are they just the weakest link of Pharmacia conspiracies
The machine destroying crushing the system
You must overcome being taken to trial
You kill the evil desire
You must forgive the system that stole your control
And then kill the demons pushing you to fall
All through the ages given men to trial
Countless pharmaceuticals to relieve the sickness
But as the goes on and on some are put to trial
But in the failure of a drug is a man a martyr
Of a system of a conspiracy
A casualty of war against the human soul
An incessant plot to make you deadly sick
and burn your soul
The master of reinvention
Finding the way potential
The master of reinvention
Running around with a head full of words
Sitting around with a tape full of riffs
Seeming ideas come from the sky
Run through my fingers and run through my mind
More inspiration beyond myself
Messages flowing to my brain cells
The Master is sending a message to me
To share with the world
Salvation scream
Running around with a head full of words
Sitting around with a tape full of riffs
The master is sending a message to me
To share with the world
Salvation scream
Extraction the sound of the Fire
Machine gun hit to your heart
Vibration the way of the Beat
Bringing forth a form of new life
Deep rumblings life is a vapour
Hand on the Truth of new guard
Growing years in the scene
A sense of eternity
God within a man's desire
A sense of eternity
Struggling with onslaught demand
Within the Power of God I stand
Chasing the new born reality
Integrity strong men of God
Blitzkrieg to stand for the Lord
Cannot be captors of weak
Eternity the reborn arise
Together forever never to die
Reform the truth of the past
New found ways back to your heart
Refusal to change the path
On to which the mighty stand
Great urgency life is a vapour
Hold on to the truthful ways
Making straight the way of old
Holy truth to stand bold
God within a man's desire
A sense of eternity
Life is a vapour today is the day
Hold on to reborn life
A chain is only as strong
At its point of weakest link
And the vital remains presented
From a heart full of The Faith
No one can control a mission
Of God unequally yoked
Elasticised outrage Things are falling down
Elasticised outrage
Now is the day the time to change
Everything in your life falling apart at the seams
Have no hope in hell to what are your dreams
Manifest mystery what is your life after death
You're down on your knees what hope for the rest
Nothing right in your life no foundation of stone
Not coping with a life never holding on to you
Burning your sorrows chugging on the toke
No money now you're broke your dollar up in smoke
All your clothes are falling off
Elastic in your belt has dropped
Can't hold a job  cause you're too smashed
With a hope you're lost in hell
Find some right inner life salvation within
Find a way in the light your life now begins
Buy some new Tracky Daks so begins the way
Now that you've got a help a brighter new day
Change outrage
One man with courage makes a majority
Killing the demons in the minority
Battle hymns from days of old Revival
Taking down demonic holds destroying
Hacking through the evil hordes
Killing demons slash of sword
Evil blood will stain the ground
Victory for those in power
Killing evil in the soul forever
One man standing to be bold
Destroyer
In his brain he kills the hordes
To his mind he reads the sword
Daily he implores the Lord
To bring holy power
He must not stand alone anymore
Fighting together we bring The Sword
The righteous life now we will employ
Living life as one in The Way
We must see this eternal death
Arriving from a lack of faith
We must find the eternal path
Transcending to our eternal destination
Pilots hanging from shoulder dust
They have no escape plan of action
Pilots hanging from shoulder dust
They have no flight path no direction
Now embrace the holy path
Leading to our eternal home
Now release an act of faith
Believing that Christ has saved our souls
Eternal death no remorse
Sees us saved if we are lost
Only through the righteous blood
Can we stand to save our souls
Eternal death without repentance
No reprieve your death sentence
Red Sonrise rising up the horizon
Red Sonrise ain't no illusion no disguise
I see the Son within my eyes
Ain't no illusion no facade
You're the Saviour You are the King
You are the One to whom we say
You are the Light You are the Way
The Messiah King of kings
God Almighty Reign supreme
The town crier in the streets
Spreading the news for all to hear
Pushing the envelope Crushing the seal
Pushing the envelope breaking the evil
The Red Sonrise in the sky
Pushing the envelope of your mind
King is coming hair blown high
For His family His only bride
I'm not confused I know where I'm going
I'm not confused I know where I'm going
Eternity is a very long time
I think about what we will find
Can this be the end of it all
Just this life or is there more
Broken bodies lying on the ground
Broken mind that is not found
Are we just a piece of meat
There must be more than we can see
What is this life that is mine
Muscles and meat hanging on a bone
Are we just a shadow of self
Or are we a product of design
Broken brain walking round the town
Lost at sea nowhere to be found
Live your life as we are drowning
Reaching out to another land
Are we burning or are we shining
Thinking about burning Thinking about burning
Thinking about shining Thinking about shining
Thinking about burning Thinking about shining
Thinking about burning Thinking about shining
Eternity is a very long time
I think about what we will find
Can this be the end of it all
Just this life or is there more
Broken brain walking round the town
Lost at sea nowhere to be found
Live your life as we are drowning
Reaching out to another land
Alexander The Metalworker
Did a great deal of harm
You should be on your guard against him
The Lord will repay him for what he has done
He has strongly opposed the Message
At my first defence no one came to support
They all just deserted
Would you be a metalworker
Would you stand up for the Throne
We should find our true perspective
Think about the life we've become
The Lord stood by my side and gave me strength
So that the Message May be proclaimed
God will take me to His heavenly kingdom
To Him be the glory forever and ever
I was delivered from the lion's mouth
The Lord rescued me
From every evil attack
I thank God for Resurrection Band
Play your song of Freedom
Help turn my life around
Walking around just dazed and confused
Had no direction no clue what to do
I was on the hell road Heavy metal blind
Then I heard Rez band just in time
God hit me like a hammer blew me off my feet
Heavy rock for Jesus that was what I needed
Inspire a generation of Pure Metal Rock
No indecision the path I had to take
I salute Resurrection Band
For heeding the call to sing songs for God
To help save souls the lost and bewildered
Need not walk blind just listen to the Jesus RockI know you are my mother
Misteriously you ride
Trought seasons and the ages
Join with you across the bades
Into the death
I'll reborn
Union grant as and will claim
She's the queen of the dark
Eternal Mother
Mournful Mother
Freewill Mother
Event of us all given of life
And given of death her shroud
is open wide to recieve our rotten corpse
funereal sign of new life
hearse proceed everyday
crown of flowers toward us
Eternal Mother
Mournful Mother
Freewill Mother
Dark
Hanged in the plane of no time
Breathing inside is stopped
Changing is all around
Even the trees has got teste
Crepuscolar Whisper feeling nocturnal
Crepuscolar Whisper night's reign begins
Eternal elemental sensation
Natural beat perpetual
Creatures who die and who born
Night's pulsation arise
Crepuscolar Whisper feeling nocturnal
Crepuscolar Whisper night's reign begins
We see forward dark shine
We celebrate the advent
We drink nectar in cup
We dance around bonfire
We hail the oul priestess
We open arms to the sky
We ride through fields and woods
We call the ancient truth
Crepuscolar Whisper night's reign begins
Under the shine sacred blood
Sinister eye of the space
Emanation flight of witches
She's a priestess she's a cut
moon ray
woman whore
bastard moonchild
Secret number door of sun
Eye of the night seer in the sky
Occult phrases hidden mysteries
In the cycle the time is stopped
I here is a strange quiet in the cemetary
A foggy curtain cover the place
Slight wind bot creeping
Insinuating on the earth
And entering into the crypts
I don't know if this wind
to feel also alive
But now the burial of spendind day
Has ended here there is no more
Nobody only dead representation
Of necromantical ritual corpse
Without life exhumed knowing
Difficulties process
Too many people believe in it
as supersticious
There are the certains presupposed
Of this resurrection under the wisdom
An'direction of necromancer
Blind resurrected
Will wake up and walking
I retain as possible entering in the chain
Of the existance between life and death
Zombie
It's a mysterious eternal relation existing
Between corpse and soul
Mystery lies again between
Crosses immobles and graveyard tomb
Unknown doom again
Show the face symbolic of a legend
A legend understood by someone
Five centuries ago a coven
was persecuted oona
and her adepts hidden themselves there
Vengeance from beyond
Mysterious deaths terror in castle
Since she was buried interiors torments
Vengeance from beyond
The master of the country
Organized the hunt
Innocents victims
Sent to the stake
Fear in the hamlet between superstitious
Men inguisition like supportm
Fanatic judges occult presences
Around the bed horribles nightmares
Curse through astral light
Vengeance from Beyond
Another place and land
Presence there was still invisible
Company Necrophag shadows
Threshold was the insanity
No support an'relief
Vengeance from beyond
One night a fatal dream
He lived his victim's vengeance
Vengeance from beyond
Death arrivedThe bearer of burden returns with inability to cope with separation anxiety
It remains to torture me until I breathe and don't scream
It stays to chip away at me until I sleep and don't dream
Roots from my feet sprung like barbed wire and serpents's tongue
rendering me still  a quadripilegic in an iron lung
On my back with scavengers above
The scent of carrion  rotting love
Master your fear
This is a call to arms for every human who still has a shred of life left in them
If they want what we have let's see them try  come and take it  try to take it
You won't take us
We don't die
For teh lives of those who think and feel
for all who still try
for those who touch nothing they cannot steal  hope is the last to die
With promises and poison they try to fill us
It will take more than everything they have to kill us
Make the first shot the best you've got
Miss and live to tell I think not
For the lives of those who think and feel
for all of us who still try  on the soil of this battlefield hope is the last to die
May it rain on you forever
We are all alone together
Crippled by selective memory
Choose which lie to believe
One man heartstring tugofwar
The more I love the more you leave
I hate you with all my heart
Counting on the law of threes
Fool me once shame on you
Fool me twice shame on me
There's something not right that can't be made right
Everything in focus now
Gag and vomit at the sight
It seems you've forgotten about the gifts I had to give
If this is the case perhaps I'll forget to forgive
I hate you with all my heart
Counting on the law of threes
Fool me once shame on you
Fool me twice shame on me
Do you believe in hell below
Do you fear a God above
Soul searching on dead end streets
You can shove your fucking love
No actions without consequence
Nothing said makes any sense
Fuck what you've done
Take what you want and fucking run
Life her is war
What do you fight for
Are you alive
What gives you good reason to survive
Are we alive or are we all just waiting to die
On these crowded streets I'm completely alone
Awake in flames in this disfigured city I call home
Watch time elapse
Watch the world collapse
Life her is war
What do you fight for
Are you alive
What gives you good reason to survive
Are we alive or all just waiting to die
Life here is war
Lock me in a room throw away the room
There's nothing left
Growing fears
Sleep for years
Wake in tears
I'm on the edge
I'm on the fucking edge
I swear to you
Make one move
Give me one excuse I dare you
These words are ammunition
This voice is a gun
Not one of you is safe
Fuck you all
Turn and run
I've learned my lesson
Life is barren and bereft
Deaccession until there's nothing left
Putting you away or putting you to rest
Denial or death which one is best
So much for trying
So what you're dying
Better you than me
Boiling contempt
Singe and sear
No escape from here
I'm on the edge
I'm on teh fucking edge
I swear to you
Make one move
Give me one excuse
I dare you
These words are ammunition
This voice is a gun
Not one of you is safe
Fuck you all
Turn and run
I am my father's son
A milewide mean streak through me runs
What I deserve what's lived gets learned
Connections cut loyalties turned
Born to destroy
My knives are praying in delirious thirst
In cancer city I am the cursed
I'm at my best when things are worst
The sharpest tongues cut their own throats first
Born to destroy
Commitment to lasting and total destruction
Leave nothing left
Breathing annihilation
Living the darkest obsession
Flesh scored like a field
Byproduct of dissolved inhibition
By now you'd think I'd have learned my lesson
I'm this close to giving up
In one breath turn wish to wonder
Don't follo me
I'm going under
No progression
Gaping lips anticipation
Distorted onesided reflection
Crippling depression
Pernicious suppression
Abandoning conviction
Internal eutrophication
Pure elation in regression
I'm so close to giving up
I cease to wonder
Don't follow me
I'm going under
No death songs are sung
No hesitation to devour the young
Take what isn't needed  leave the rest
Bleed until there's nothing left
Bred and caught
Sold and bought
No thought to what human hands had wrought
Every day a hundred thousand slaves
Every hour a thousand graves
Hear the chorus of the calloused drown the sounds of endless malice
Now the sane must decide when to answer the call to defend
A practice of cannibalistic insanity
Sadistic neanderthalic barbarity
Bred and caught
Sold and bought
No though tto what human hands had wrought
Every day a hundred thousand slaves
Every hour a thousand graves
No escape no relief from suffering beyond belief
I was on the ground for years
The ugly truth carved out of fear
Always looking for more to steal
Fullcolor nightmares becoming real
This pack of wolves is haunting me
Unrelenting unwelcome memory
Light feet an dsharp teeth are tracking me
Follow the scent of tragedy
In packs they gather
With fake smiles they greet
They the hunters
I their meat
The bloodiest will loathe the cleanest
Like scavengers with desparate wild eyes the abused becomes the meanest
Of all the starving I am the leanest
Remember me  remember me to no one
Cut out  cut out my restless tongue
The disastrous compulsions which lead me to this embrace like a plague like a viper's kiss
Cut out my tongue to stop the screaming
Its human nature to keep on dreaming
Magnifying just to see less
Sewn together until seamless
Every one of us will be this drugged and fucked until dreamless
Remember me  remember me to no one
Cut out  cut out my restless tongue
The disastrous compulsions which lead me to this embrace like a plague like a viper's kiss
Rest your ugly head and sleep now
Sleep now
Life will change
Keep dreaming
Life will change
Keep dreaming
Thousands of years of illusory days of deceit
Hollow eyes of simple minds flattening their feet
Atrophied minds easy survival
No wants no needs
Their hands on their Bible
Work for the worn safe place for teh sane
A place for lies unveiled mistakes made plain
I wait while the world wakes
Find a home for my hands
Desperation holding hands with tragedy

Living on a jet
Making love to someone else's dreams
Say it again
She puts her leg up
Well calls it good luck
Do you know what I mean
Do you remember
Well I remember
Oh no oh no
Dream machine
So damn cool she can turn on the night
The more she gets
Well the more that she needs
Do you know what I mean
Do you remember
Well I remember Oh no oh no
Too fast
Too fast for love
Too fast
You're too fast for love 
Oh no oh no
She's a streamline queen
On a sex craved movie screen
Say it again
She'll use her time up
Have nothing to show
Well mark my words
Do you remember
Well I remember
Oh no oh no
You're too fast
You're too fast for love
In her eyes
You're the night's desire
You're the one on her lips
She'll drink your love
In the shadow of blood
It's a deadly deadly kiss
You're just a man
All in her prey
In the web of delight
All you can do
Is close your eyes
Cause you've lost
Your life
In this theatre of pain
Love and hate's the same
To the black widow
To the black widow
To the black widow
I need a love
I need a love
I need another black widow
I need a love
I need a love
I need another black widow
Well among kings and queens
Love and hate's the same
In this theatre of pain
Love and hate's the same
To the black widow
Now listen up
She's razor sharp
If she don't get her way
She'll slice you apart
Now she's a cool cool black
Moves like a cat
If you don't get her game
You might not make it back
She's got the looks that kill
That kill
She's got the looks that kill
That kill
She's got the looks that kill
Now she's bulletproof
Keeps her motor clean
And believe me you
She's a number thirteen
The church strikes midnight
She's lookin' louder and louder
She's gonna turn on our juice boy
So she turns on the power
She's got the looks that kill
You say our love
Is like dynamite
Open your eyes
'Cause it's like fire and ice
Well you're killing me
Your love's a guillotine
Why don't you just set me free
Too young to fall in love
Run for the hills
We're both sinners and saints
Not a woman but a whore
I can just taste the hate
Well now I'm killing you
Watch your face turning blue
Not yet a man
Just a punk in the street
You say our love
Is like dynamite
Well its no surprise
Cause you've got oneway eyes
Well you're killing me
Your love's a guillotine
Not yet a man
Just a punk in the street
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again
Do you don't you want me to love you

Tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer

He's the wolf screaming lonely in the night
He's the blood stain on the stage
He's the tear in your eye
Been tempted by his lie
He's the knife in your back
He's rage
He's the razor to the knife
Oh lonely is our lives
My heads spinnin' round and round
But in the seasons of wither
We'll stand and deliver
Be strong and laugh and
Shoutshoutshout
Shout at the devil
He'll be the love in your eyes
He'll be the blood between your thighs
And then have you Cry for more
He'll put strength to the test
He'll put the thrill back in bed
Sure you've heard it all before
He'll be the risk in the kiss
Might be anger on your lips
Might run scared for the door
But in seasons of wither
We'll stand and deliver
Be strong and laugh and
Sittin' in the classroom thinkin' it's a drag
Listening to the teacher rapjust ain't my bag

Kickin' ass on the wild side
The blade of my knife
Faced away from your heart
Those last few nights
It turned and sliced you apart
This love that I tell
Now feels lonely as hell
From this padded prison cell
So many times I said
You'd only be mine
I gave my blood and my tears
And loved you cyanide
When you took my lips
I took your breath
Sometimes love's better off dead
You're all I need make you only mine
I loved you so I set you free
I had to take your life
You're all I need you're all I need
And I loved you but you didn't love me Laid out cold
Now we're both alone
But killing you helped me keep you home
I guess it was bad
Cause love can be sad
But we finally made the news
Tied up smiling
I thought you were happy
Never opened your eyes
I thought you were napping
I got so much to learn
About love in this world
But we finally made the news
You're all I need make you only mine
I loved you so so I put you to sleep
She's only fifteen
She's the reasonthe reason that I can't sleep
You say illegal
I say legal's never been my scene
I try like hell but I'm out of control
All in the name of rock 'n' roll
For sex and sex I'd sell my soul
Pretty pretty so innocent
She says you ain't seen nothing yet
Brings me a dirty dirty magazine
There she was for all the world to see
I try like hell but I'm out of control All in the name of rock 'n' roll
For sex and sex I'd sell my soul
Says to me daddy
Can I have some candy
Wanna be your nasty
Anytime you want
You know you can have me
All in the name of rock 'n' roll
When I get high
I get high on speed
Top fuel funny car's
A drug for me

Always got the cops
Coming after me
Custom built bike doing 103

When we started this band
All we needed needed was a laugh
Years gone by
I'd say we've kicked some ass
When I'm enraged
Or hittin' the stage
Adrenaline rushing
Through my veins
And I'd say we're still kickin' ass
Ooo ahh kickstart my heart
Hope it never stops
And to think we did all of this
To rock
Kickstart my heart
Without you there's no change
My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same
Without you I'd be lost
I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl you'd never never know
Without you without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you woman The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you without you
Without you my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
Knowing someday I'd grow strong Without you without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you woman
The world comes down on me
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you without you
I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only youas we grow old
Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you without you
We could sail away
Or catch a freight train
Or a rocketship into outer space
Nothin' left to do
Too many things were said
To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did
Seasons must change
Separate paths separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain
I knew it all along
I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along
That's alright that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright that's okay
Let's turn the page My friends called today
Down from LA
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away
That's alright that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
Thats's alright that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away
That's alright that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright let's turn the page
And remember what I say girl
And it goes this way
Girl don't go away mad
Girl just go away
She's got an alligator bag
Top hat to match
Dressed in black on black
She's got a Philipino girlie
She claims is her friend
I tell you boys you just gotta laugh
Now I used to call her Cindy
She changed her name to Sin
I guess that's the name of her game
I really used to love her
Then the kitty she discovered
It's got to be a sexual thing
All all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same ol' same ol' situation
It's the same ol' same ol' ball and chain
I say no no no
No no no Introduced me to her lover
In a cellophane dress
Then they bid me a sweet fairwell
Last time I saw them
They were kissing so softly
To the sound of wedding bells
All all around the world
Girls will be girls
It's the same ol' same ol' situation
It's the same ol' same ol' ball and chain
Just like a punch in the teeth
Or a swan dive to the street
No no no
No no no
If it wasn't for bad luck
I'd have no luck at all

When daddy was a young man
His home was living hell
Mama tried to be so perfect
Now her mind's a padded cell ya
Hey man get out of my face

With your screweddown antihuman views
Deal with the pressures by playing the blues
If you wanna live life on your own terms
You gotta be willing to crash and burn
Scream shout
Come on come on come on
Scream shout
You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low
Just when things went right
It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm comin' off this
Long  winding road
I'm on my way
Well I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home You know that I seem
To make romantic dreams
Up in lights fallin' off
The silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothingkeeps me together
At the seams
I'm on my way
Well I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight tonight
I'm on my way
Just set me free
Home sweet home
I'm on a holiday hooligan's holiday
Drop dead beauties stompin' up a storm lines of hell on our face
Bruised bad apples crawling through the night busted loose runaway oo runaway
Always always a thrill without a motive
30 days such a haze
Everybody wants a piece of the action
Everybody wants a piece of the pie
We're on a holiday hooligan's holiday
I'm on a holiday hooligan's
I gotta get away hooligan's holiday
We're on a holiday hooligan's yeah Crosseyed derilicts comin' iron horse

Modern times and new blood's pumpin'
Only the strong survive
Little old man contemplates suicide twice a day
Life's passed him by
Little old woman scared and blind left alone in desparate times
Life's passed her by
Oh life it's misunderstood them so they close their eyes and dream of better
days
Oh life it's misunderstood yeah
Life's not always fair or so they say
Little boy with vacant eyes daddy won't be home tonight
And he don't know why
His mother she sits alone tangled in the web she's sewn
Lives lie to lie
Oh life it's misunderstood them so they close their eyes and dream of better
days
Oh life it's misunderstood yeah
Life's not always fair or so they say
Strangled caged left alone doin' time in a broken home
Feelin' left to die
I'm a product of your troubled ways
You made me what I am today
Now you're asking why
Oh life's misunderstood me so I close my eyes and dream of better days
Oo life's misunderstood me
Life's not always fair life's not always fair or so they say
or so they say
Restless soul deep inside searches for some piece of mind
Livin' just to die
I'm an angry man and I always have had to fight to survive my past
A sign of those times
Life it's misunderstood me and I know you know that you've been there too
Time lets a restless soul fade away
Life's not always fair life's not always fair or so they say
Little boy with hopeful eyes daddy's comin' home tonight
So don't you cry So don't you cry
So don't you cry So don't you cry
Rhythm denotes the regular pattern flow
Of sound and movement and speech ya know
Rhythm dictates the soul to stop and go
Of the sound that moves the streets ya know
In a natural phenomenon boom
And it makes ya wanna do it 'til you gotta go
Boom over here boom over there boom everywhere
Boom over here boom over there boom everywhere
The beat is sweet and it melts in your mouth
This ain't no shit no doubt
You gotta shake things break things
Everybody take things to a higher level
Pumpin' jumpin' a physical activity
Pumpin' jumpin' a physical profanity
I make a drum speak the language of rhythm
I create this boom for you
Boom over here boom over there boom everywhere
Boom over here boom over there boom everywhere

the conflict rubs against my grain
but i cannot flush it down the drain
we are so hopeless
we are hopelessly in love
she breaks my will
she's my bitter pill
addicted to her
can't fight off the chill
she blurs my world
she's my bitter pill
we creep the night
just to taste the thrill
hopelessly in love
she's the kind of love drives a man insane
she sticks her poison right in my vein
spinning around
over and upside down in love
she breaks my will
she's my bitter pill
addicted to her
can't fight off this chill
she blurs my world
she's my bitter pill
we creap the night
just to taste the thrill
hopelessly in love
she blurs my world
she's my bitter pill
she breaks my will
she's my bitter pill
we creap the night
just to taste the thrill
addicted to her
she's my bitter pill
alright alright this life is what you make it
don't slide you can't compromise
you click your heels 3 times imagination goes wild
you can't analyze
so be sure that you are makin the best of what you have
the truth is all within yourself
don't be a slave a slave to someone else
higher higher it's where we want to be in our minds
it will mesmerize
it pleasure power that's what we devour
you can have it crystallize
now it's time to look at what you've done with your life
and the path you found and followed in
yourself i won't be a slave a slave to anyone
the question is
when it's all done
who will stand
and who will run
the answer is on my tongue
i won't be a slave to anyone
so be sure that you are making the best of what you have
the truth is all within yourself
don't be a slave a slave to someone else
Bashful Betty such a bondage brat
Dressed in latex and coated in sewer rats
A serpents tounge calculating mind
Gets top dollar for the hip shake divine

Better wear your rubber boys

There's something that I need to say to you
I know it's late
But this can't wait
I just got a new tattoo
One love and a one woman
You're my new tattoo
Tonight is the very first night of my life with you Until the day I die
I promise it's true
Everyone will see my new tattoo
Tonight I saw your face up in the stars Stumbled here to paint you on my arm
There's something that I need to say to you
So I wrote this song
Cause you belong
Right here on my new tattoo
One love and a one woman
You're my new tattoo
Tonight is the very first night of my life with you Until the day I die
I promise it's true
Everyone will see my
I don't want to see us fade away
I don't want to be without you another day
I could be your Dorian Gray
I won't fade away
No I won't fade away
One love and a one woman
You're my new tattoo
Tonight is the very first night of my life with you One love and a one woman
You're my new tattoo
Tonight is the very first night I'll spend with you
Yeahah
Don't wanna be without my new tattoo
Yeahaahh Yeah
Everywhere I hear the sound of marching charging feet boy
Cause summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street boy
But what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
Cause in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man  No
Hey Think the time is right for a palace revolution
But where I live the game to play is compromise solution
Well then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
'Cause in sleepy London town
There's no place for a street fighting man  No
Hey Said my name is called disturbance
I'll shout and scream I'll kill the king I'll rail at all his servants
Well what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock 'n' roll band
Cause in sleepy London town
There's no place for a street fighting man  No
I wake up to find myself
After all these years
And where all the time has gone
Still seems so unclear
'Cause there's no one else
Since I found you
I know it's been so hard
You should know
If I die tomorrow
As the minutes fade away
I can't remember
Have I said all I can say
You're my everything
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
It brings out the worst in me
When you're not around
I miss the sound of your voice
The silence seems so loud
'Cause there's no one else
Since I found you
I know it's been so hard
You should know
If I die tomorrow
As the minutes fade away
I can't remember
Have I said all I can say
You're my everything
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
I spent all my life
Looking for our innocence
I've got nothing to lose
One thing to prove
I won't make the same mistakes
Now I know
That everything will be ok
When I die tomorrow
If I die tomorrow
As the minutes fade away
I can't remember
Have I said all I can say
You're my everything
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
You make me feel so alive
If I die tomorrow
If I die tomorrow
Wake me up in the morning glory
Cant get straight your lies are stories
How do you mark your territory
When your trash becomes your treasure
Your remorse are my pleasure
Lose your mind at your leisure
Simply said your complicated
Understand you're overrated
The more you talk the less you seem to say
We are miserable
You are driving me insane
This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your
Sign that things are going wrong
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
Chew me up like a meat grinder
You're coldblooded like a sidewinder
I don't need another reminder
Cant understand normal thinking
Drive a sober man to drinking
In fact you drive me straight to hell
We are miserable
You are driving me insane
This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your
Sign that things are going wrong
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
The more you inhale
The more that you breath
The more that you make me
Wanna scream
This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your
Sign that things are going wrong
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song
Sick love song
This could be your
Sick love song
This could be your
Reason not to get along
This could be your
Sick love song
Sick love song

Sick love songI was looking at the tv news
People everywhere blowing a fuse
People everywhere under the gun
Little kids dying never had no fun
Human beings ain't got no brains
Think you're better but you're all the same
Think you're clever but you're all to blame
Here we are again in the same old frame
Shut up I'm talkin'to you
It's on television so it can't be true
And I can't play the game no more
Wake up and see it through
Kill the many to save the few
I know what the blind man sees
On your feet or on your knees
Headline terror crime on rise
Half ain't true and the rest is lies
Same old smile on the same old face
Same old horse with the same old race
I wouldn't smile if I was you
Don't relax 'cos it ain't so new
Watch your back light the light outside
Somebody coming that you just can't bribe
Shut up I'm talkin'to you
It's on television so it can't be true
But I can't believe their lies no more
Watch out I'm coming through
Boogey man gonna bite you too
I know what the blind man sees
On your feet or on your knees
I was reading some magazine
It was written for human beings
Can't believe the stuff I read
Human trash for the human head
You humans don't be so proud
You humans don't talk too loud
You humans just ain't too smart
It's enough to break my human heart
Listen up I'm talkin' to you
Pay attention 'cos I mean you too
And I will tell you something new
Your values ain't worth a dime
Human rights just human crime
I know what the blind man sees
On your feet or on your knees
Riots in the burning street
Crystal night outside
Brutal music in the night enough to make you cry
Nobody knows how it is to scream and drown the world
I am the midnight snake to bite your little girls
Outside in the distance the city in the fire
See the houses burning down mile after mile
I don't think you know about your future yet
I don't think you're gonna like the one you're going to get
Ghost rider in the sky
Burner
Lights outside my window victims on the floor
Rats in all the bedrooms thunder at the door
Nobody knows anything kill and wear a smile
Here comes the pirates baby don't' you touch that dial
You will never hurt me you won't put me down
This ain't no circus and I sure don't need no clowns
I will be the one you can't be
I will see the things that you can't see
Demons blind your eyes
Burner
Beat me like a hammer baby stick me like a pig
Throw me to the lions baby wear me like a wig
I am not only one to walk into the fire
I would rather burn than let them make me a liar
I cannot be beaten I cannot be like you
I cannot be otherwise no matter what you do
I am the voice of broken glass
I am the voice to drive you mad at last
I am the truth the liar turned around
Burner
Burner
Burner
Burner anyway
I saw the millions the naked and the dead
I saw the city streets running bloody red
I saw a thousand bombers circle in the sky
I saw the firestorm fifty stores high
I saw a hundred thousand scream and burn
I saw the armored wheels grind and turn
Universal soldier doomed to live to tell
Fight and die forever burn in bloody hell
Death or Glory Death or Glory
March forever in the sound and fury
Death or Glory Death or Glory
Blood and iron it's the same old story
I held the Iron Cross first class with the swords
I marched with Hitler down the bloody road to war
I was at Jutland loding 'till the gun was hot
Killed at Trafalgar without firing a shot
I was at Moscow burning in my tank
I was at Shiloh marching in the ranks
I was a Sturmbannfuhrer fighting in Berlin
I was a Russian Hero dying for Stalin
Death or glory Death or glory
March forever in the sound and fury
Death or glory Death or glory
Blood and iron it's the same old story
I swung a saber and I was a young Hussar
I was a Cossack fighting for the Czar
I was a Viking Berserker from the North
A Roman Gladiator murdered just for sport
I was with Bonaparte I died at Waterloo
I was a Frankish Knight a Polish Jew
I was a Spartan in the Trojan Wars
I was a warrior for Crazy Horse

Auf Stehen
Murder I am you know it was me
I was the one that you didn't see
I was the cut down to you bone
I put you there under that stone
I I am the blade I am the dream of the brave
I I am the knife I bring grief to you wife
I I am the sword I am the word of the Lord
Do what you will I bring you the edge
I am the one to sever your head
I cut so deep I can cut straight
All depends on the moves you make
I I am the blade I am the promise unmade
I I am the knife I bring death to your life
I I am the ax to stop you dead in your tracks
I I am the sword I bring the fear of the Lord
Centuries pass dust in the wind
I shall remain shining in sin
The metal I am the iron you feel
The song of the dead the chorus of steel
I I am the blade I break the oath that you made
I I am the mace I am the blow in the face
I I am the ax to cut down heroes like rats
I I am the sword I do the work of the Lord
Listen up here I'll make it quite clear
I'm gonna put some boogie in your ear
Shake and bop don't you stop
Cance like a maniak until you drop
I don't mind I don't mind
I can tun a razor right up your spine
What are you waiting for
What do you think you were created for
Show us you care show us you dare
You don't know what happened not if you weren't there
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Voodoo medicine cast my spell
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Play that guitar just like ringing a bell
Take it or leave it
Going for broke rock 'til you choke
It don't matter if you drink or smoke
Speak through the beat get up on your feet
Sweating like a hpund dog white as a sheet
Don't you be scared don't you be scared
Everybody terrified it don't seem fair
What are you waiting for
What do you think you were created for
Out of your seat blind in the heat
Do the nasty boogie mama stomp your feet
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Go back to zero take a pill and get well
Be a good soldier and die where you fell
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Go on out and boogie  'cos you never can tell
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Be a good soldier and die where you fell
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Little girl sleeping in dreams of peace
Mommy been gone a long time
Daddy comes home and she still sleeps
Waiting for the world worst crime
And he comes up the stairs like he always does
And he never turns on the light
And she's wide awake scared to death
She smells his lust and she smells his sweat
Curled in a ball she holds her breath
Praying to a God that she's never met
Don't let Daddy kiss me don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight
Little girl lies by her Daddy's side
And she listens to him breathe
She knows there's something awful wrong
That she's far too young to see
And she knows she can't tell anyone
She's too full of guilt and shame
And if she tells she'll be all alone
They'd steal her Daddy and they'd steal her home
And it's not so bad when Daddy leaves her alone
Praying to her God with his heart of stone
Don't let Daddy kiss me don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight
Why tell me why
The worst crime in the world
And so Daddy lies by his daughter's side
And he sleeps deep and well
No nightmares come to him tonight
Though his daughter lives in hell
For his seed is sown where it should not be
But the beast in his mind don't care
And the only sound are tears that fell
Little girl turns her face to the wall
She knows that noone hears her call
But it seems that God hears nothing at all
Don't let Daddy kiss me don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight
Shoot me down baby look at you move
Dancing like you ain't got a thing to lose
Your fight for breath
Way you look scare a man to death
I can't speak my heart's on fire
You're the focus of my desire
Can't be real can't be true
You might be a virgin but you ain't brand new
I know you're a bad bad woman
Turn around and you'll see me coming
I know you're a bad bad woman
Good enough for me
Here I come baby watch my smoke
Gotta getcha and it ain't no joke
I hope your body ain't telling me lies
You bring a tear to my lying eyes
I wish I could I wish I might
Get the wish I wish tomight
Drive me crazy turn me inside put
Gotta have you baby ain't no doubt
I know you're a bad bad woman
Turn around and you'll see me coming
I know you're a bad bad woman
Good enough for me
Give it up baby let me jump your bones
Fired up almost grown
Can't believe you want me too
Here I come honey woop  de  do
I know you're a bad bad woman
One look and you set me running
I know you're a bad bad woman
Good enough for me
Liar you take your hand from me
I'll tear it from your wrist
Just take your hand from me
Liar your mouth is ashes dog do not presume
To fool me with your tales of god
Liar Promises of Heaven now
You cannot truly think you are the seven now
Liar And I will challenge you
All my life I swear that I will challenge you
I will be the watcher and I will never sleep
Many miles before me and promises to keep
Driving out the demons and bring them all to trial
I see the face that cannot smile
Liar You should be burning now I know you are
The face and it is turning now
Liar Your words are filth and false
You are the vile partner in the final waltz
Liar Will be rid of you a good day in any life
Will be rid of you
Liar I see you eyeless smile
There is no other thing upon this world so vile
I will be the hero and I can do no more
I can be the hero as I have been before
I can take you places that you have never seen
I can make you pleased that you are clean
Killer Do not presume I'm fooled
You kill the hearts of many but I'll break your rules
Killer Don't show your teeth to me
I'll put your teeth and feed you with them count on me
Killer I am thy killer too
I am the frightful thing that always follows you
Liar   I am thy nemesis
I always knew one day that it would come to this
Why the world is wicked
I know the reason why
Why the world is wicked
I know that it's allowed
I can never leave it the way it was before
I can never disobey  the law
I am a drifter on a hungry empty sea
There is no one on earth to rescue me
The winter storms they freeze me
Summer burned alive
I can't remember when another soul passed by
Marooned and stranded on the Islands of the Damned
There is no one on earth to take my hand
There is no voice to speak no soul for company
The sun goes down like blood into the Western Sea
Alone and dying and a thousand miles from home
I know I never was so bvroken and alone
I searched the sky for God shivered to the bone
Drowned in sorrow Lost in the Ozone
No hand for me abandon me
Wash over me watch over me drowned forever
Alone and crying and a thousand miles astray
Alone upon the cruel sea forsworn and cast away
I turned my face to God but his fase was turned away
Lost in the Ozone nothing left to say
Lost in the Ozone nothing left to say
Nothing left to say nothing left to say
Wash over me
Back to back you see me now
Show me what you're hiding here
I can't move if I don't sing
I can't stand I got no chair
Can't see me I'm the man ain't no joke
Can't see me master plan up in smoke
Can't hear me I'm so loud suits me fine
Can't hear me I ain't proud all the time
Follow me and don't you move
Stop at nothingshow your teeth
I can see you I'm not deaf
Two years later twice a week
Can't see me I'm the man laid in bad
Can't see me give a damn Motorhead
Can't hear me up your way ring your chimes
Can't hear me I can't stay all the time
I can tell you it aint me
I won't be no beast up there
Turn me  'round 'cos I can't dance
Be a spaceship I don't care
Can't hear me stand up straightrow my boat
Can't hear me hit the deck fishtail goat
Can't see me on the game ain't no crime
Can't see me aeroplane all the time
We bear your names we come to you
We own the game we run to you
We bring the blazing sun to you
We bring the blazing gun to you
We are your children grown and strange
We are your children unashamed
You breed contempt we mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
We bring the shake we bring the shake
We say these things to shock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
We climbed into the mean machine
We saw the ad we bought the dream
We rather victims of neglect
We will not be what you expect
We are your children strange and weird
We are your children free and clear
You breed contempt we mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
We bring the shake All hearts to break
We bring these words to mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
We bring the shake All hearts to break
We bring these words to mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
The only thing that I regret
I didn't take what I could get
You owe us much you owe us life
We owe you nothing eat the knife
We are your children chosen few
We are your children come for you
We bring the world to shock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
We bring the shake for goodness' sake
We bring the truth to mock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
We bring the shake we bring the shake
We bring the shake to shock you now
We bring the shake to rock you now
Hear my voice hear my voice hear my voice
Make your choice make your choice make your choice
Beat the drum beat the drum beat the drum
Hide the sun hide the sun hide the sun
Devils in my head tonight
All is wrong if it's not right take care
Whispers in the walls I hear
Nothing ever made quite clear beware
Go to hell go to hell go to hell
Make me well make me well make me well
Show your hand show your hand show your hand
Make a stand make a stand make a stand
Angels in my heart tonight
Say the word and make it right so dark
Angels flying in my dreams
All is never what it seems take heart
Speak my name speak my name speak my name
Feel no shame feel no shame feel no shame
Take your time take your time take your time
You are mine you are mine you are mine
Monsters in my eyes today
I can't make them go away it's true
Strangers in the world it seems
Nightmare visions fever dreams
I dream of youI was looking at the tv news

Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Voodoo medicine cast my spell
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Play that guitar just like ringing a bell
Take it or leave it
Going for broke rock 'til you choke
It don't matter if you drink or smoke
Speak through the beat get up on your feet
Sweating like a hpund dog white as a sheet
Don't you be scared don't you be scared
Everybody terrified it don't seem fair
What are you waiting for
What do you think you were created for
Out of your seat blind in the heat
Do the nasty boogie mama stomp your feet
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Go back to zero take a pill and get well
Be a good soldier and die where you fell
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Go on out and boogie  'cos you never can tell
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
Be a good soldier and die where you fell
Born to raise hell Born to raise hell
We know how to do it and we do it real well
Little girl sleeping in dreams of peace
Mommy been gone a long time
Daddy comes home and she still sleeps
Waiting for the world worst crime
And he comes up the stairs like he always does
And he never turns on the light
And she's wide awake scared to death
She smells his lust and she smells his sweat
Curled in a ball she holds her breath
Praying to a God that she's never met
Don't let Daddy kiss me don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight
Little girl lies by her Daddy's side
And she listens to him breathe
She knows there's something awful wrong
That she's far too young to see
And she knows she can't tell anyone
She's too full of guilt and shame
And if she tells she'll be all alone
They'd steal her Daddy and they'd steal her home
And it's not so bad when Daddy leaves her alone
Praying to her God with his heart of stone
Don't let Daddy kiss me don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight
Why tell me why
The worst crime in the world
And so Daddy lies by his daughter's side
And he sleeps deep and well
No nightmares come to him tonight
Though his daughter lives in hell
For his seed is sown where it should not be
But the beast in his mind don't care
And the only sound are tears that fell
Little girl turns her face to the wall
She knows that noone hears her call
But it seems that God hears nothing at all
Don't let Daddy kiss me don't let Daddy kiss me
Goodnight
Shoot me down baby look at you move
Dancing like you ain't got a thing to lose
Your fight for breath
Way you look scare a man to death
I can't speak my heart's on fire
You're the focus of my desire
Can't be real can't be true
You might be a virgin but you ain't brand new
I know you're a bad bad woman
Turn around and you'll see me coming
I know you're a bad bad woman
Good enough for me
Here I come baby watch my smoke
Gotta getcha and it ain't no joke
I hope your body ain't telling me lies
You bring a tear to my lying eyes
I wish I could I wish I might
Get the wish I wish tomight
Drive me crazy turn me inside put
Gotta have you baby ain't no doubt
I know you're a bad bad woman
Turn around and you'll see me coming
I know you're a bad bad woman
Good enough for me
Give it up baby let me jump your bones
Fired up almost grown
Can't believe you want me too
Here I come honey woop  de  do
I know you're a bad bad woman
One look and you set me running
I know you're a bad bad woman
Good enough for me
Liar you take your hand from me
I'll tear it from your wrist
Just take your hand from me
Liar your mouth is ashes dog do not presume
To fool me with your tales of god
Liar Promises of Heaven now
You cannot truly think you are the seven now
Liar And I will challenge you
All my life I swear that I will challenge you
I will be the watcher and I will never sleep
Many miles before me and promises to keep
Driving out the demons and bring them all to trial
I see the face that cannot smile
Liar You should be burning now I know you are
The face and it is turning now
Liar Your words are filth and false
You are the vile partner in the final waltz
Liar Will be rid of you a good day in any life
Will be rid of you
Liar I see you eyeless smile
There is no other thing upon this world so vile
I will be the hero and I can do no more
I can be the hero as I have been before
I can take you places that you have never seen
I can make you pleased that you are clean
Killer Do not presume I'm fooled
You kill the hearts of many but I'll break your rules
Killer Don't show your teeth to me
I'll put your teeth and feed you with them count on me
Killer I am thy killer too
I am the frightful thing that always follows you
Liar   I am thy nemesis
I always knew one day that it would come to this
Why the world is wicked
I know the reason why
Why the world is wicked
I know that it's allowed
I can never leave it the way it was before
I can never disobey  the law
I am a drifter on a hungry empty sea
There is no one on earth to rescue me
The winter storms they freeze me
Summer burned alive
I can't remember when another soul passed by
Marooned and stranded on the Islands of the Damned
There is no one on earth to take my hand
There is no voice to speak no soul for company
The sun goes down like blood into the Western Sea
Alone and dying and a thousand miles from home
I know I never was so bvroken and alone
I searched the sky for God shivered to the bone
Drowned in sorrow Lost in the Ozone
No hand for me abandon me
Wash over me watch over me drowned forever
Alone and crying and a thousand miles astray
Alone upon the cruel sea forsworn and cast away
I turned my face to God but his fase was turned away
Lost in the Ozone nothing left to say
Lost in the Ozone nothing left to say
Nothing left to say nothing left to say
Wash over me
Back to back you see me now
Show me what you're hiding here
I can't move if I don't sing
I can't stand I got no chair
Can't see me I'm the man ain't no joke
Can't see me master plan up in smoke
Can't hear me I'm so loud suits me fine
Can't hear me I ain't proud all the time
Follow me and don't you move
Stop at nothingshow your teeth
I can see you I'm not deaf
Two years later twice a week
Can't see me I'm the man laid in bad
Can't see me give a damn Motorhead
Can't hear me up your way ring your chimes
Can't hear me I can't stay all the time
I can tell you it aint me
I won't be no beast up there
Turn me  'round 'cos I can't dance
Be a spaceship I don't care
Can't hear me stand up straightrow my boat
Can't hear me hit the deck fishtail goat
Can't see me on the game ain't no crime
Can't see me aeroplane all the time

We own the game we run to you

If I could do it over then I'd do it over you
Still watching the sky
We ain't sure of you yet
New in town been around
Heartbreaker for sure
Maybe running from the law
Just passing the time
Just moving down the line
Not time to fall no time to fail
No time for anything at all
Stay out of jail
Still facing the door
Just watching the street
City born ripped and torn
Still turning tricks
Enough to make you sick
Just passing the buck
You might be real bad luck
Not time to fall no time to fail
No time for anything at all
Stay out of jail
Can't see you right now
We ain't got the time
Bad news stand accused
A fool in drag got your nose in a bag
Whacked out of your head
Y'all remember what I said
No time to fix
No time to bail
No time for one last call
Stay out of jail
When you got it you know you got it
When it's gone you know you lost it
Nobody ever switched your switch
Nobody ever scratches your itch
Out of time serves you right
Where you gonna sleep tonight
Out of time blinding light
Now you're gonna feel the bite
Turned around again turned around again
Turned around again
Out for blood out for blood
Out to lunch and no damn good
If you need it you must believe it
When it's gone you cant retrieve it
Can't see where it all went wrong
You don't know what's going on
Out of time serves you right
Where you gonna sleep tonight
Out of time blind at night
Now you're gonna feel the bite
Turned around again turned around again
Turned around again
Out for blood out for blood
Out to lunch and no damn good
When it's on you know it's on
When it bites you know you're wrong
Don't feel good about yourself
Don't know if you're someone else
Out of time serves you right
Where you gonna sleep tonight
Out of time blind all right
Now you're gonna feel the bite
Turned around again turned around again
Turned around again
Out for blood out for blood
Out to lunch and no damn good
Turned around again turned around again
Turned around again
Out for blood out for blood
Out to lunch and no damn good
When your name is spoken
Then Your soul awakes as well
And there is n limit to the power of the spell
You can never leave it
You can never let it lie
You must find the speaker
For one of you must die
The name the name the name the name's the same
All your lives are on the line
All your lives are on the line
And all your life you know you're dying
What you know you must not tell
What you know you must not sell
All the secrets you can keep
All the lies you cannot speak
Everybody steals your time
Thousand voices in your head
Everybody everybody
Shouting fit to wake the dead
When you see the devil
Then you're looking for relief
And there is no relief
And there is no justice
Keep your tongue between your teeth
You can be the devil
But you cannot count the cost
All your time is wasted
All your love is lost
The name the name the name's the same
Play the game
You can never be the one
You can never be the one
When you know all your love is gone
What you know you must not tell
What you know you must not sell
All the secrets you can keep
All the lies you cannot speak
Everybody steals your time
Remember me what I said
Everybody everybody
Shouting fit to wake the dead
When you are alone here
In the houses of the blind
Don't you ever wonder what happened to the time
You cannot regain it
You cannot bring it back
Stretched out on the rack
The name the name the name's the same
The name the name's the game
You will never know the truth
You will never know the truth
We both know you will never look
What you have is yours my friend
You will never see the end
All your future gone to hell
All your past an empty shell
You cant keep upon your secret shelf
You are not the Antichrist
You are not the Lord of Flies
You are not important now
You are not the one to dread
Everybody everybody
The name the name's the game
All life is a mystery
All things come to he who waits
All things just a twist of fate
It's just a state of mind
All your time is not your own
It's real hard to find out why
It's real hard to say goodbye
To move on down the line
Both your eyes wide open
You see the shape I'm in
It wasn't of my choosing
It's only bones and skin
And I will plead no contest
If loving you's a crime
So go on and find me guilty
Just one more fucking time
All your life is in your head
All you dreams are in your sleep
And if your dreams are hid too deep
They're just a waste of time
When you try to chase the dream
You never seem to know the time
You never recognize the signs
And nothing's what it seems
Both your eyes wide open
You see the shape I'm in
It wasn't of my choosing
It's only bones and skin
And I will plead no contest
If loving you's a crime
So go on and find me guilty
Just one more fucking time
And if I would have been a bad man
You would have seen the good in me
You would have seen the other
The good man I could be
But since I am a good man
The same was all the same
Nothing I could do nothing I could do
All life is a mystery
All things pass you by in time
All things just a perfect crime
It's just the way we are
All instincts let you down
It's not a case of love in vain
It's not a case of love insane
It's enough to break your heart
Both your eyes wide open
You see the shape I'm in
It wasn't my idea
That I be the one to sin
And so all those years together
Weren't worth a fucking dime
So go on and find me guilty
Just one more fucking time
And so all our years together
Weren't worth a fucking dime
So go on and find me guilty
Just one more fucking time
And so all our years together
Weren't worth a fucking dime
So go on and find me guilty
Just one more fucking time

Clock is still ticking
Why don't you listen
Ain't got the time that you had yesterday
Can't be so blind way out of line
Thinking the world wants to hear what you say
Nobody ever knows why
Nobody ever knows who
Nobody sees that we're all on our knees
Looking for reasons to do what we do
Hey what the hell
Get out of your shell
Time to get back to when truth was all true
Get me some danger
Get me a stranger
Time to be counted and pay up my dues
Stand or fall
Get ourselves something that we can believe
Fight or crawl
Use what you find in yourself to succeed
Stand or fall
Wearing your heart on your sleeve
Politics suck you'll be shit out of luck
If you ever mess with the methods they use
No way to doubt three strikes you're out
You against them it's your freedom you lose
Nobody questions the law
Nobody questions the man
Nobody cares 'cos nobody knows where
We go to so we can kick out the jams
Hey what the hell
You know yourself well
Get back to your honor and pride
Time for some slamming
Time for some jamming
Take us away from the snare of their lies
Stand or fall
Get ourselves something that we can believe
Fight or crawl
Use what you find in yourself to succeed
Stand or fall
Wearing your heart on your sleeve
We're on the run we're under the gun
Sneaking and hiding away from the sun
Breaking the law don't know what for
Our generation is made up of whores
Get out of town get out of jail
Nobody here gonna make us our bail
Don't really care that my life isn't fair
Hard on your head in the electric chair
Out of your mind deaf dumb and blind
Don't know how people can be so unkind
Grown up too soon grown up too soon
Too many wolves looking up at the moon
Way too clean too fucking healthy you know what I mean
Way too rich every executive son of a bitch
Way too mean they're all to eager to feed the machine
Way too smart gonna come down and break all of our hearts
Way too slick  way they schmooze like to making me sick
Time to leave wearing your heart on your sleeve
Wearing your heart on your sleeve
We shoot power to your heart a mighty thunderbolt
We charge all batteries we save your soul
We don't know when we're licked
But we turn lead into gold
We know alchemy we bring you rock and roll
We are the ones you love or we're the ones you hate
We are the ones always too early or too late
We are the first and we just still might be the last
We are Motorhead  born to kick your ass
We bring the firestorm to brighten up your life
We mend all broken hearts we cure all pain
We bring you attitude and razor teeth to bite
We bring machine gun law and we're the ones to blame
We are the ones you need the ones that you despise
We are the ones who wanna poke you in the eye
We are the future baby used to be the past
We are Motorhead and we don't have no class
We bring you UFOs saucers in the sky
We shoot you full of noise we aim to kill
We burn like motherfuckers spit right in your eye
We fight authority we glorify free will
We are the ones you heard of but you never heard
We are electric prophets here to twist the world
We are the flame at night the fire in the trash
We are Motorhead we are Motorhead
We are Motorhead we are Motorhead
We are Motorhead we are MotorheadLie in endless wait behind some cold shadow for a stream of stars that have long since died
Their burnt cinders fall upon my heaped corpse and seep into my open pores
With the deadened silence of my exiled mind shattered a torturous word crawled to the darkest cavern of my
being where a dim glow resonated from the eyes of my dead dream and tore a hole in my lachrymal sleep
'Twas as if I had motioned the skies to part and a piece of heaven to tumble past my hungry eyes when a
single lonely drop fell to the inviting earth and buried unending furrows to carve me open
An absurd drop of pain within such a vast ocean of disease
presented a dismal glimmer of searing bliss that passedin such a blinking moment
that it might have slipped unnoticed but for the piercing cries in my heart
The dismal moments have now passed to flounder between the sea
and disease and lay waste to your bubbling pores
The soft murmurs poured forgiving 
and with envious assault laid waste my breath
In fleeting moments of joy a knock betrayed the vigilant ear and drowned in vastness
You see through the dream behind the vacant smile of the dead 
And cut the seams that held together my breath
Lifeless I lie thoughts tear my mind and you fly
Your sharpened breath echoes these halls for life
Slip the warm knife through my searing flesh
Nefarious agony slips inside my smile
As the swallow lands and bleeds to suck the light and with it weave dark veils of strangling gloom to cover
this silent room
A fragment of shuddering light appeared and began to bite at the air so thick with deceit that all stood
still all was weak
to echo through your soft murmurous heart 
and pierce your every word
The dreaming veil strangles your shortening breath
as oceans of pain wash through your open veins and pour to the inviting earth
To leave not a trace of those moments
that filled the empty halls and cold 
would be to close the shutters on the dayand to dream behind a veil 
The word that crawled around inside falls away
With raiment bedecked by the grey cloudfilled sky and the larks song pouring
on the dying day the chain upon my limbs groping the fleshless wounds
devoured the yearning bowels of compassion from foetal darkness
Sleep derived from falling to escape breathless depths
where the dreamless pursuit is shattered fused by contrivance
from stained womb drowning in the air so thick with deceit
that the vapours of passion drop to your feet
From this angle it almost looked human
But the hole in the ocean just swallowed me up
Down here you may hear a sharpened scream
forming featureless enfettered states
that have me tearing the walls of danger
down here all is dark and dazzling
Slain by bliss and grief I kissed the raindrop on your taut wooden cheek to reveal an empty cry that passed
in the swaying of the breeze
In possession of a celestial object the obtrusive fatigue lay still in a corner
The vivid shuddering emotion let loose on the flawed pursuit returned bare
To walk among intricate ordeals to survive the artifical heaven that turned the marble monuments pale is
a cold effigy to the dulcet murmurings of loneliness
The insolent caul spoke of forgetfulness and the glittering air that tends the limpid seasons The sea of
reason clawed its way to a height and came crashing down while the blazing thoughts lay vunerable beneath the
elusive gaze
The distance is not a door but a silent black wall to which we are committed The moon is gone but my lidless
sleep remembers its traces like fingerless hands crawling on my back 
The sinister duel between waking and torture rages on as the dour hours slowly fall
Opened my veins yesterday and poured in the twilight
with its dead promises Nothing makes sense in an imaginary
world that no one can touch In the strange hours I dream of evenings 
under moonrise and of fashioned ideals before they could turn
and go had seeped their treachery into my widowed summers Is this my lover this face of death I recoil to
the unmoving view
The soft voiceless emotions escape the exhausted frame to assail
tomorrows empty heaven The dawn with its dull smell fills my nostrils
and the stench of a burning sun separates the hope from silent lips
There is something painful in the first spring bud of life it tears at the insides and claws at the doors of
tenderness 
that riseth in black forms from an obsolete graveyard
To cast my eyes on the horrors you have created or to turn and gaze
at the clouds It remains cold and dark and the painless times revel in
a distant memory that only seem to trespass when the night is clear
The bitterness tastes sweet and it conjures up images
of a narcissistic funeral 
that injure my dreams
narcissistic dreams
The wordless world bleeds to the point of despair and the failed attempts to move end in quiet massacres The
lurid calm is a stalking mountain that eludes the perceptive eye but eventually overwhelms to send us cowering
Through a mirror of silver my sullen sulcus portrays some dark anger
For the grey lights wrapped their chaotic shape round my tiredhungry eyes
Fractaled rancour bleeds through the lifeless mirror within which
all hope sprawls dangling from the cool draught of air to amuse us all
The black and white frames which flash unerringly bend
they bend to an end touched by scorching sunlight and this self induced madness 
Where I see the world explode into miniscule droplets of unnerving sadness
But to stop would be to blunt the very stars that shine from behind a threatening stone
The yellow beams touched by starlight delve the shrieking
tortured air to founder in a sea of ether and a planet of fools
Idle minutes devour 
Open space seething nebula
takes hold and strangles 
dripping torment Bright and lucid
Colours meld 
design that seem to dip and swerve
to fathomless depths where eyes can drink 
the sights of dreams
It is in these moments of ponderous nausea that the scattered 
atoms solidify 
The cruel silver portrait swallowed by time itself had uttered nothing
but truth through the separated darkness
With morningfall emptied
it's aching particles into the reaches of my furrows
From the window the sky empties to nothing 
and the murder of crows with their ravished beaks
groan for the hollowed inhabitants of the passing day
Insatiable sorrow with its draughty halls sent a gleaming sword to consume the passing madness only to be
plunged into a diminishing perspective
Inside I trawl the motionless ravines a twisting hatred that bubbles from under the steaming scarlet brook
while the incessant rain washes away the gnawing of your imprisoned eyes
Anger with it's steaming arrows cuts through the dank air
dissecting the worn out guilt of October's echoes that drip sadly
from the dead branches
but before they cold leave
they spent a cold summers eve
tending the knotted despair
of a ravaged corpseDear daughter these men see you as a harlot and nothing more Listen closely you were never created to be a whore There is more to you you were made with a purpose in mind There is more to you open your heart and see through my eyes You will never find a love
that's greater than this while your so concerned with the words of broken men Don't let them define you seek your identity in the one who designed you You will never grow with chains around you binding your heart to the grave but you never listen when I warn you of
the wolves that hunt their prey Wake up Wake up Come back to me and you will see that you are not alone I've been patiently waiting for so long but you're so quick to run from my arms Tell me is this really worth it Cause your breaking my heart I will never give
you anything that you can't overcome but the pain in your eyes is far too much for me to bear Cry out You never left my sight you'll never escape my love I never saw you as anything but beautiful I am the healer only if you believe it if you believe it I can be
the father you've always needed only if you believe me If you believe me you can be the bride that I desired if you believe yourself If you believe yourself I never saw you as anything but beautiful How can you say that you love me when you've damned me to fail
 The only love I've ever known is as brittle and cold as you I've cried and screamed at your gates I sang my pleas but your answer remained the same Silence Alone in the dark I had to grow So don't point your judgement at my disfigurement without a potter to share
my pain Watch what you say my tears match yours ten fold Call my name I spilled my blood and bore this pain for you You're worth every lash on my back the holes in my hands every spear in my side I adorned this crown of thorns and built this kingdom for you my
bride
These adulterous lips have purged 1000 lies I am a wolf in a sheep's disguise paralyzed be the fear of failure But I've already failed in His eyes Caught up like a thief in a trap my lust is the noose and it's wrapped around my neck I'm suffocated by the weight of
regret I thought she was my bride but I forgot she was your daughter We were blind we walked like sheep to the slaughter Father please forgive me for I know not what I do I swore this would be different but I never followed through Oh God Oh God What a wretched
man I am Oh God Oh God Dear God I am not a man Since when did I become a thief I reached my hands in the pockets of a God who lives by grace and I stole the innocence of His child I know I'm better than this Oh God take my lust before I cave and degrade something
beautiful again Keep her safe in your arms and hide her away from me I am a monster I am a thief Show me how to be a man This is not the real me I long for change 'Cause I want a bride to love not an idol to rape
Oh God this is too much for me I try to close my eyes but I just can't get to sleep I've been tossing and I've been turning and I've been screaming in my bed cause my mothers got her demons and can see 'em in my head Come back home I cannot comprehend the choices
you have made you traded your gold for a cold and hollow grave Who are you now Who are you now I've never seen this side of you She's never coming home she's never coming home She's crawling through the dirt and shes looking for the light but she scared of what
she'll find so she closes her eyes She's not coming home tonight she's intoxicated with the lies She's not coming home tonight the road is there but she is blind She's lost her way she can't seem to find the light He's calling for her but she can't seem to hear
his voice She's on her knees begging please lord save me Her faith is wearing thin again She's dwelling on her pain longing to be healed but she walked out of that door all on her own You've made your choice and now this place is not your home Your porcelain faith
has left you hollow you chose a blind man to follow You traded your treasure for a casket Now this is my family this is my family I choose to be the bigger man this hate has no hold on me Though there's so much pain coursing through my veins I decide to let it die
so I can finally come to life Your demons are not my demons though I see that yours still live let's fight them off together causeI choose to forgive I choose to love you with all I am I choose to forgive I choose to accept you for who you are You will always
have a home in my heart so don't you think for a second this has torn us apart Though I still need time to heal it doesn't mean that you're alone we're all in this together so please come back home
I can't define myself I've got a lot of baggage with me I've worn so many masks I can't recognize my face What do you see in me Why waste your time on something unclean I've forsaken my vows I am a harlot but your hands are still reaching for me You've unlocked
my chains but I refuse to leave this cell I remain in these shackles surely this is my hell I am diseased I am filthy I step into glory but the shadows never leave the back of my mind Your eyes see right through me only you can know my heart Tell me do I still
have a pulse Or is it too weak to hold a spark Surely there is someone else who deserves a king like you I'm far too unfaithful to be pursued I've heard you calling me so many times before Why waste your breath on such a filthy whore My son my son You keep
calling out my name My son my son You keep screaming at me I'm not going anywhere Run to my arms I'll set you free Your chains are gone so run to me Run to my arms you've been set free
Father please have mercy on me I am a sinner and I am in need of a savior so come rescue me I am willing but I am so weak All my strength is gone Pull me out pull me out Tear down this facade Wake me up wake me up I idolize you sit on the throne of my heart
I despise myself I am naked empty and poor Tear down all my walls Rip off every single mask Strip me bare and let me start again This is my last beginning this is my call to arms This is the death of me the past is buried and gone No more starting over I've
said my goodbyes No more going back I swear it's different this time Let me see through your eyes Oh God bring me back to life Show me what it means to be born again I came into this world dirty I'm made from the dust Now I'm part of this machine and I'm
starting to rust I heard that you could walk on water Can you teach me how to stand on the waves
The introduction
I hear you voice ringing in my head I am I am the one who was raised from the dead The oceans tremble the mountains bow down at the sound of your name This is not a formulaic religion this is a masterpiece built on intimacy This is not an empty theology this is
love this is relationship
The stage
Where is the mystery Where is the intimacy My God is not a concept you fit in your head This is the call for a new faith we've lost our way There's no time to wallow in our pity a change must be made I refuse to give in swing wide oh gates of heaven Fill up
these empty bones and let this army rise Rise up Rise up
Now is the time to stand on your feet and fight for your God
The reality
Well it all comes down to this the honest truth of what's inside Were all broken men with fading dreams and a heart that's half alive But were trying to move on and walk with strength beneath our feet Father God I know you're there cause I can feel you breath This
is the struggle we face I hear your voice in my head I am I am How dare I compare all that you are to only what my eyes can see You've seen right though my masks and yet you still pursue me
The call
Now is the time to stand face to face with yourself no more hiding behind your walls This is the end the end of deception This is the end rip off the maskIn the most deep and absolute darkness
In the depths of the true abyss
That hides the most perverse desire
Under the pale air of melancholy
Shines the essence of pain
Pain and hate
Are the only presents for humanity
Pain and hate are their only memories
Pain being live and felt
The most primary of feelings
Being consumed by the desire of surmounting
Hate my eternal way by my side
We are eternal fellows
Pain and hate
Are the only presents for humanity
Pain and hate are their only memories
This is my dominion
Guided by the flame of anguish
I search for consolation deep in the abyss
Where the eternal laws are ruled by the only Lord
Pain and hate are the essence of Evil
Revenge and hate are the reasons that keep me living
March strong
Forwar Black Warriors
Get off the shadows leave the chaos
Walk among us
Black Metal
Sentries of the Damned Empire
Let sound the melancholy melody
Forwar War
Black Metal  Hymn for Warriors
Black Metal  The most true feelings
The flag is raised
Listen Warriors
Our blood is noble
Nothing can stop us
Neither their laws
Nor their galse gods
Cos there is no salvation in chaos
Just spread our war
We are warriors of the Evil Horde
Nothing is so real and so strong
As the feeling we have
Our reign doesn't get intimidated before weaks
We are Damned taken as barbarians
We are just the brave survivors
From the empire of weaks
United by the force
Of the co salled dark fraternity
Under the sign of glory
We'll triumph again
Guided by hate
Fed with the truth
Calling again the ancient man
Where the choice is made and the
Strong one acclaimed
Under the vast shadow
Walks the chosen one
Where the night is just
The beginning of this glory
At the limits of dawn
Where no human being has dreamed to reach
Proud there he is
Strong just mediating
To triumph in his plan
The law is present
The equilibrium is kept
The elements make their presence
All purity is maintained
Nothing changes the law of the strong one
When dark night comes
When silence invades the soul of the warrior
Only one voice echoes
Sounds the message deep from the abyss
We are the messengers of doom
Hidden by the full moon
We bring a mission
To rescue the respect for our ancestrals
We Great All the Elements
Dimmed by the long wait today we are free again
Our hate is free against the ones
Who betrayed us
We are at war again
For the Honour
For the Glory
For the Eternal Power
Honour Blood
Proud
Desire is the way that brings us to revenge
All the power is reached
Respect is again a gift for the strong ones
Ours mission is getting clonclued
In the shadows of night
In the woods Under the full moon
The only noise that fills the emptiness
Is the melancholy howl of wolves
Deep in the woods
Where I can find all my creatures
Come forth nocturnal creatures
Let the silence speak for you
Find out consolation deep in the woods
Where pain gives place to melancholy
In the night
In the woods
In the shadows
Of full moon
The howl of wolves
Is a comfort for my ears
Only in the shadows of night
I meet my creatures
Where we make the law
For a New Kingdom
In the night
In the woods
In the shadows
Of full moon
Oh Might Light and burning flame
Let it unveil thee glory
Unveil the mysteries of your creation
In the name of Satan
Whose sustenance will prevail
From the cloister comes threatening the rebellion
Come forth great spawn of the abyss
And make thy presence manifest from deep and
The abyss shall come a sign
And vision shall become as reality
I call upon the messengers
Come forth in the name of Abbadon
Join us in our fraternity
And destroy the race of weaks
Oh Great Brothers of the night
Join us in our power
In behalf of the ones who own the power
The True Worshippers of the Horned God
We celebrate the Eternal Evil
We are strong and we are beside the strongs
We celebrate Thy Supremacy We sing the
Most deep canticles
We exalt and honour Thy PresenceWhen you see me
You´ve been trying to hide
I could eat you
And it feels just allright
Any cold winter night
You will all die 
When my prey is wounded
That´s my only holy moment
You might move in herds
I Hunt Alone 
When I see you
I don´t hate you I cry
When you´ve seen me
You´ve been all paralized
I´m the beast that you fear
In the shadows of night 
When my prey is wounded
That´s my only holy moment
You might move in herds
I Hunt Alone 
Any cold winter night
You will all die
I´m the beast that you fear
In the shadows of night
When I see you
All I need is to smile
I don´t like your kind
Don´t you waste my time
I don´t want to have you around 
My embassy
Has been closed for years
I can´t feel sympathy 
Jesus Christ is walking again
But he won´t stand up for me 
Cause I Kill You For Nothing 
If you´re feeling down
Really down and out
Don´t you take it out on me 
Don´t you waste my time
I don´t like your kind
I don´t want to have you around 
Jesus Christ is smoking again
But he won´t pass on to me 
Cause I Kill You For NothingI'm calling your name
So what's left of this broken dream
Tattered and torn
Do we cry
Do we find that we're breaking just breaking
We're helpless just helpless
Can't stand this Is this all that's left
Sorrow breaks me down it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive somewhere inside
Tattered and torn do we cry
Do we find that we're breaking just breaking
We're helpless just helpless
Find me something I could be
Find me something I should be
Sorrow breaks me down it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive somewhere inside
Sorrow breaks me down it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive somewhere inside
What can I say
With the weight of the world upon me
What can I say
With the weight of the world upon me
Sorrow breaks me down it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive somewhere inside
Sorrow breaks me down it's crushing me tonight
But I feel alive somewhere inside
Try to control my senses
Inside the picture is lifeless
An instance in my head
The image so blissful
Reminds me of all that I've had
And all that I've lost
The image will fade
But I can't let go of the memory
It's all in my head
And I can't hold on to what's gone
Time breaks me down
Try to forget what's haunting me
Destroy what's reminding
Leave behind what's inside me
The Image will fade
But I can't let go of the memory
It's all in my head
And I can't hold on to what's gone
Time breaks me down
I can't hold on I can't hold on
It haunts me
But I can't let go of the memory
It's all in my head
And i can't hold on to what's gone
Time breaks me
I can't let go of the memory
It's all in my head
And I can't hold on to what's gone
Time breaks me down
I'm falling away
Feels like I'm drifting away from what I was
This feeling sinks like stones
Find I'm giving in
Lose my grip as it pulls me under
Believe the day is not lost
We still have our broken dreams
Give me a hope to hold onto
A light in the dark
Lift me up
I am falling forever
Adrift in an endless night
We burn now as the daylight scars my eyes
I'm shattered yet whole
In the wake of despair
You pulled the trigger and ran
I bleed the pain you made
The blood red affection
As you pour your heart out
Give me a hope to hold onto
A light in the dark
Lift me up
I am falling forever
Adrift in an endless night
We burn now as the daylight scars my eyes
These dreams always fall aside fall aside
These dreams all but left behind
Fall aside
Fall aside
Lift me up
I am falling forever
Adrift in an endless night
We burn now as the daylight scars my eyes
Lift me up
I am falling forever
Adrift in an endless night
We burn now as the daylight scars my eyes
Display the image cloud the concealed
Betray your idolized conception
Egocentric enshrouded in a lie
Cut the connection to my heart
Dejected Chimera
Envision virtue
Rejection consumes me
Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction
Break down the artificial effigy
No respect no integrity
Lift me up to drop the bombshell
This infection can't deny me
Rejection consumes me
Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction
Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction
Watch you fall from my arms
Tear me down it's so cold
So cold
So cold
Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction
Take what was mine
My afflictions are all that I have
Time takes me away
From this year of affliction
These dead walls confine me
As vacant as my mind
I see the end upon me there's no savior
So heal me this pain can't last forever
I feel my wings are burning
Maybe I'm not forsaken
The silence speaks the words unspoken
Behind the tears there is salvation
Behind the hurt a new beginning
Lift my head up high
I try to catch my breath
Stay awake to stop from going under
So heal me before I'm lost forever
Oh I ask forgiveness
Maybe I'm not forsaken
The silence speaks the words unspoken
Behind the tears there is salvation
Behind the hurt a new beginning
Far beyond the point of turning
Enslaved in freedom
Can't see invisible chains
But still we feel them
Get in line walk to your end
We're driving our demise
Shape your fate with every step you take
Adrift in the river the river of strife
Forget to remember what's dead inside
Like lambs to slaughter we're lead astray
Just pawns in a game called life
So overburdened
Adrift in the river the river of strife
Forget to remember what's dead inside
Dead inside
Just decay
Can't betray the system
Seize today
Find a way to forget
I close my eye's the memory's gone
Adrift in the river the river of strife
We've lost our way
Forget to remember what's dead inside
We drink from Lethean
Ascend the defection of this life
Can't live forever with the lies so callous
Separate all the bonds that would blind us
Disconnecting from the heartache
Take apart our disguise
Do we transcend this life
Everything that reminds me of all that I've known
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies
Neglected we survive
Abandoned ruined cast aside
So worthless
Do we transcend this life
Everything that reminds me of all that I've known
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies
We're trapped in silence
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies
We are oblivion
Fade to grey
Betray you
Fall away
Fall away
Descending
Do we transcend this life
Everything that reminds me of all that I've known
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies
We're trapped in silence
Take apart the disguise
And see through your lies
Turn away as the daylight fades to grey
It's crashing around you
No regrets but the bitter taste of failure
As the innocence fades away fades away
I'm hollow
I feel the night taking away what's mine forgive me
I am undone tell me you know I'm sorry
You're all that I have
Another day another chance to be forsaken
You're gone with the sunrise
Torn apart and I can't forget this memory
It's burning inside my head
Seeks to breaks me
I feel the night taking away what's mine forgive me
I am undone tell me you know I'm sorry
You're all that I have
No one can save me cannot save myself
I cannot see the light
I feel the night taking away what's mine forgive me
I am undone tell me you know I'm sorry
I feel the night taking away what's mine forgive me
I am undone tell me you know I'm sorry
On the verge of slipping away
Descending existence
We let go we are our weakness
Fixation damnation
Don't bruise my conscience
Is this the fate you've made fate you've made
The hour comes
Time does not wait
We're stand alone in the darkness
The hourglass turns
Nothing's changed
On the verge of slipping away
Surrender forever
All alone in the great divide
Remember this moment
Don't bruise my conscience
Time does not wait
We're stand alone in the darkness
The hourglass turns
Nothing's changed
Days turn to years
Now we're facing our fears
The hour's upon us
We walk to our fate in the darkness
Time does not wait
We're stand alone in the darkness
The hourglass turns
Nothing's changedTime does not wait
We're stand alone in the darkness
The hourglass turns
Nothing's changed
Play the game
Pass the blame
Hollow truth ends in shame
Live alone to die with wisdom
Live to hate
Instigate
All that I ever had
Is the path to our conviction
Let me survive
I suffer alone
Without a prayer
Feed me on lies
Starve me of life
Just break me
Suffocate
Segregate
Do we cry in vain
Are we lost in conviction
Die away fall astray
Can't smother my pain
You never think to question why
This is the path to our conviction
Live to hate
Instigate
All that I ever had
Is the path to our conviction
Let me survive
I suffer alone
Without a prayer
Feed me on lies
Starve me of life
Just break me
Suffocate
Segregate
Do we cry in vain
Are we lost in conviction
Die away fall astray
Can't smother my pain
You never think to question why
Without a thought
We forget hope
Help me remember why remember
We are still so far from this life so far away
Is this a dream
Why does it feel so real no longer
All so unreal
Suffocate
Segregate
Do we cry in vain
Are we lost in conviction
Die away fall astray
Can't smother my pain
You never think to question why
Try as you might I won't give in now
As you wear me down
Looking for something you've lost inside yourself
See your reflection now you can't deny
Looking through your mind
The truth is a lie you've buried inside
These perceptions
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in your head
Your world's collapsing but still you deny
What you've found inside
The ignorant bliss you're hiding behind
These perceptions
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in you
Just reflections
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in your head
So breathe new life
My heart gets left behind
Once more
Heart gets left behind
My heart gets left behind once more
In your eyes
These perceptions
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in you
Just reflections
Misconceptions
They're in your head
They're in your headWithin the words lies something cold
A glow of light from one so old
Every page calling my name
Symbols excuse me of all blame
Your presence here astonishes me
The colossal things that you will read
Just breathe my name to set me free
Your soul alive will be my fee
And one by one the numbered fall
My duty is its own reward
Better do ill than suffer it
Alarming fingers of my wrist
My name is dark and my want will claim thee
The command to weep has now been given
This is how the words are freed
And the lashing whip of utter greed
A ruined soul and empty man
A lost shaow so old and damned
An awful martyrdom so holy and feeble
A winter face lonely eyes
A husk containing bitter lies
To sleep now buried away
To be read again to be obeyed
Wintershire we defend up hills high
Into the dark weave of a great dark storm
Cold red snow from their flow from sword and bow
Kings and men fall or fight a punishing
Everywhere thousands lie God almighty
Driving them from our land to their sea
Great fathers and sons brothers everyone
Out upon that scene under wintersun
Draw your blade once more From the trees they pour
Say a prayer out loud Let us end this war
Sweat at the sword and the killing hand
Let the steel answer them Show no mercy
And snow leaves a drift of sin and loathing
Yet they come evermore What is this
Many fell today and their bodies lay
All across this land as their spirit fades
Name upon name fabled and brave
Years of doing this but they always came
My wounds let me know the rage of winter and the world
Every hour I'm broken down I will not kneel before you broken
Nearer now their faces clear And books held in bloodstained gloves
Right from here I can see the whole world dying in their flames
In the beginning were the words they forced into me
Pages inked in blood A new God comes to save us all
I placed her steady in front of me
And within her lips she caved into me
And hold her fast I did
Lest she be swept from this earth
The sullen coast of her heart
The menace of her island
I know that I am unkind
I'm honoured lover that you still try
Her heart careful and broken
She places its pieces below
And with the length of her whole body
Are shadows so very old
Her body was a belief
My kiss its dedication
A serpent this is she
Whosescales release the ocean
Her weeping face I hold in my hand
As her salutation
It's from her shadows
She took me to cast asunder
Se that fears my presence
Loves me when I'm absent
The growing blindness of my soul
Sinking under
Salvation dropped me from her dying arms
Endless the skies are dark
This world is nothing without her
As it limps from beauty's answer
It dies in the hand of summer
This long savannah of her
The weapon of your body
Lays my city to waste
From blood on my golden sand
I came up and washed you
I'd lost saints for you
Drew towers into the earth
And a silver blade from God
Hands directly above us
Bacchus drowns more men than Neptune
And I put my name among them
I hate everyhing around me
But I want to carry you back
To HeavenHello next century  next millennium hello 
Should we be afraid 
Should you be scared of mankind 
A skin protects us but it will be a sieve 
The pores will expand fantastic gates 
We have the chance to survive or to die 
A gateway predicts new ways 
Spread out your arms  enjoy it 
Spread out your minds  be afraid 
You will sense the pressure 
You will taste our filth 
You will drop out of society 
You will suffocate on the new light 
Maybe we should hope 
We can pray  but to whom 
Icons are useless 
Datafiles will help 
In the true sense of words 
We can exclude the mentallyill 
Millennium means start all over again 
Spread out your arms  enjoy it 
Spread out your minds  be afraid 
And raise a monument of future
Im getting in  instinct gives me the power 
You can feel me  I am here 
I take possession of your sentiments 
An invisible veil 
The haze is organic  it's a real threat 
Possessed by ecstatic  shrouded in mysteries 
Look at her you are wild with enthusiasm 
Movement's getting uncontrolled 
Its fun to torment with my sensual kind 
I make you blind 
If you want  call me virus 
If you can  come to terms with me 
Anytime you'll see I'm your friend 
Call me virus  if you still want 
Call me 
Amorousness if you will see
I sit on a wooden chair 
A place with cold grey walls 
The sun gives off a faint beam 
Which will be destroyed by dust 
Nothing happens nothing 
Eyes are swollen 
You'll be bound and lost in these walls 
I don't know 
What has robbed your control 
Once more 
Rescue from the freedom 
I don't know 
You rot in your own excretions 
No one helps you 
The colour of things begins to change 
I will go sick 
No one's screaming laughing crying 
The skin is wrinkled 
Eyes are wide opened 
Forget all thoughts of hope 
Caught in this nowhere 
Bones will get rigid 
Motionless you lay down 
On this cold grey stone
I am a tender something 
Caught in a golden cage 
The wonder of new age 
Created in a moving dream  just a concept 
Years passed by  countless equations 
'Til the theory about me was created 
I broke their minds 
Even though I did not exist 
They were possessed by the dream 
No one comes close to me 
Sometimes I taste the salt from my skin 
Life goes through my mind 
I want to be damned 
I was predictably influenced 
By diabolic genius 
No one thought about possible aftereffects 
And now 
A failed experiment 
Well here I'm held 
Fenced in but intelligent 
None of them provides me with affection 
None of them provides me with affection 
They are afraid of me  the monster of a new age 
Sometimes I wish I was stillborn 
Sometimes I dream I was simply different
I could run away and hide 
I could writhe with pain 
And I'll sense you're still on my side 
And I know I could never love you 
I am the eclipse which covers up your sun 
I have authority over you which overwhelms 
I am your supervisor 
No second without your torture 
It makes me dead keen on 
Full of malicious energy 
Pleading and prayer won't help 
Instructed to devastate a soul 
For a prolonged period 
It depressed me a necessary evil 
Obsessed by the lack of clarity 
Am I the source of error 
That's my own fault 
I waste someone's time
Standing before a mirror 
And I put a gun to my head 
Day by day a step further into nothingness 
But now the cask is overflown 
It seems to be that there's a voice 
Speaking to me from within the glass 
I hear words that try to save me 
And tell me something about the good things in life 
Maybe I should thinkover my situation 
Suddenly I realize that mirrors cannot speak 
And I see that the light at the end of the tunnel 
Is just another train 
A growing fear is filling my inner void 
Is there another sense in life for me 
What else can I expect for myself 
I think I'm at the point of no return 
Now I will disappear 
This is the end 
Its better to lose all control
First assembly will be a reunion 
New breeds produce old poverty 
Time finds new dimensions 
Forthcoming the beginning of the next existence 
Come fortress come 
Are we prepared for uncertainty 
We are the mind of this machinery 
The future  the start of new mortality 
The center of energy 
A solar child will assert supremacy 
It comes from the galaxy of friendliness 
Where the sun shines 
Where flowers are in bloom 
Where birds chirp on the trees 
Where dolphins glide through the ocean 
But here there'll be no sun
Fog is passing through these dunes 
Little seagull trembles on the breakwater 
Behind us trees are barren 
I admire Mother Nature in her beauty 
Only the sea is living 
But very shallow  it's the dead season 
Come into my arms tonight 
I will keep you warm 
My little princess 
My baby I'll hold you tight 
Is nothing there to let us know 
In which time we are 
Nothing that's turning around us 
A gentle breeze blows a melody 
On the withered grass which paralyzes 
A sight only for the pair on the beach 
Nevertheless  it's the dead season 
My promise  you will never lose me 
I will never leave you 
And slowly your inner sun goes down 
I can't shed your light upon
Open the gate to a new level 
Zero point starts 2008 
My friend is me he has my genius 
What is to come for us 
We have the same girl 
Scientists duplicate me 
3 4 or 100 times 
Fear or pleasure 
No feeling for risk no overview 
No time no return 
The history comes through our future 
Comes through my genetic code 
She loves me and everybody gives her my seed 
Is there a sense 
Now it makes me sick 
We have the same girland she'll never know
Do you like to follow us 
The invitation leads to a coloured kingdom 
Do you want to talk with us 
You have to take off your rags 
We're the unknown cuddletoys 
And live in space 
We abduct you in our empire 
You have to call us 
The kings of plush 
We are the kings of plush 
Diamonds and pearls show us the way 
We are the friends who look nice everyday 
We transform to wizards magicians 
Who radiate pleasurable sensations 
Is the transition accomplished 
Is the inhibition given up 
Virgins are addicted to us 
We enchant their intimacy 
Virgins are addicted to us 
Is the inhibition given up 
The transition is complete
Are you excited Why 
You'll be the hero 
Say goodbye to your vicinity 
Look what a starlit night 
Take a seat  forward line of vision 
10 seconds  maximum adrenaline 
Look what a starlit night 
No drugs can expend the mind so strong 
Emotional outburst after a while 
Hormones gone crazy 
Massive it drills through my own galaxy 
On the verge of tears 
No mind expansion 
The first cry of fear 
It's too late for recall 
Soon it's time to start 
Say goodbye to your wife 
Say goodbye to your vicinity
In the galaxy of friendliness 
The birds are still chirping 
I take a look at the beach 
Where the supervisor feeds the little seagull 
Only I can watch the whole scenery 
The solar child touches the princess 
For a moment her sun is shining bright again 
It's good to see that only through my vibes 
The equilibrium of things is intact 
The cuddletoys have some drinks with the twin 
In the pub where the tendersomething works 
There's a mirror  big as a monument 
On the wall with the dolphinwallpaper 
Only I can watch the whole scenery 
A perfect unity  all together 
I stand for recovery and harmony 
But soon a new time will come
I was born like this with hips like this
Lips like this and wrists like this
legs like this and arms like this
a fist like this to hit you with now
you're like school on Sunday
You ain't got no class
You keep running your mouth but
You can kiss my ass
Not made to measure baby
One size does not fit all
I will not be the one
You make to take the fall
I got the curves to fear the words to feel
When I scream I've heard them say
I've got the voice to heal
You don't need to be sorry
you don't need to be saved
You just need to be proud of the body that God gave
Not made to measure baby
One size does not fit all
I will not be the one
You make to take the fall
listen to me sayyeah
I'm so fat I'm fucked up
I'm so skinny I'm sick
I'm tired of the magazines
Talking that bullshit
I'm not fat you're fucked up
I'm not skinny you're sick
I'm just tired of the critics who keep talking that bullshit
Yeah
I was born like this with eyes like this
Teeth like this and thighs like this
A face like this a waist like this
and when I dieI'll die like thisnow
You're like school on Sunday
You ain't got no class
You keep running your mouth but
I just might kick some ass
Not made to measure baby
One size does not fit all
I will not be the one
You make to take the fall
Let me hear you say YEAH
You're so fat you're fucked up
You're so skinny you're sick
You're so tired of the magazines
Talking that bullshit
You're not fat or fucked up
You're not skinny or sick
You're just tired of the critics who keep talking that bullshit

American Psycho my confession means nothing
Abandon all hopeye who enter here

Leaned into the light
Now I'm crucified

With a heavy heart somebody said
Lets go our separate ways
Our relationship is strained

There is a lack of confidence
And you can feel our stress
A need for truth
Time to decide
What is and what is not best

With a question left
I will confess
Put my mind
And past to rest
Termination of our trust

The time has come
To make our move
And we can see
What we can't prove
The little things

Misunderstood by those who fear her

Talk to me
Tell me I'm not skinny
But you think I'm so pretty
Rockstars have to be thin I'm afraid
You wanna know how much do I weigh
WHAT
Weightless
You can't market me
Faceless
So blind you can't see
Showcasing
We played for your ego
That follows me wherever we go
FUCK YOU
Weightless
You can't market me
Faceless
So blind you can't see
Whats my size
Whats my shape
Look at me
I am raped
Not anorexic
Or heroine chic
I'm no waif model
Cause I fucking eat
Weightless
You can't market me
Faceless
So blind you can't see
Me
Insincerity
Insecurity
No integrity
Theres no purity
I will not apologize for scaring you
You are everything that's wrong with America
Let me introduce myself in case we've never met
An exorcism of the throat for those who crave burlesque
Erotic screams are drowned in dreams but I'm still wide awake
The central nervous system of my heart will always ache
So cut my mouth and stitch my lips I swear I'll never cry
Undress my breath strip my voice and write another lie
The cult of everything you need will lead you down the path
And I will promise not to read just promise not to ask
Come get a piece of me is that what you want
Rip me apart until I bleed because it's all my fault
Come take your piece of me if that's all that you want
Cut out my tongue so I
Can't speak and then you can talk
About me
It's true I've made some enemies cause honesty is my vice
I won't pretend to be your friend cause I'm not that nice
Described as everything you said I warned you not to come
But if I don't live up to what you thought I'm still the one
It's all the little things I've done and all the things you say
If you are so afraid of me then stay the fuck away
So high my skin is white and now my eyes have turned to black
Tongue is dumb from all the drugs
Thank God I Can't react
Come get a piece of me is that what you want
Rip me apart and watch me bleed because it's all my fault
Come take your piece of me if that's all that you want
Cut out my tongue so I
Can't speak and then you can talk
About me about me about me about me
So full of hate you waste my time on words that make me tense
I'll be the one to take the blame The first one to confess
So throw your stones and bruise my face
But you can't take my faith
I'd rather die then turn what's sacred Into something safe
Come get a piece of me is that what you want
Rip me apart and let me bleed because it's all my fault
Come take your piece of me if that's all that you want
Cut out my tongue so I
Can't speak and then you can talk
And then YOU CAN TALK
And then YOU CAN TALK
And then you can
And then you can
And then YOU CAN TALK
If you feel the need to go there then we can go there
But if not I suggest you step back before we have a MISUNDERSTANDING

Lick my licks I'm on fire
Lick my licks of desire
Lick my licks I'm on fire
Lick my licks of desireBurning nails through my veins
Deadly flowers under my feet
Putrefied water cover my immortal body
While the pestilence of life starts to beat
The flames of hell burn my eyes
Blinding the way to the deadly sign
Making me prisoner of my own rage
Delaying the arrive to the finish line
Six demons calling
Six swords fighting
Six wolves crying
Mydgard is coming
The boat arrives at the lost land
Where children cry and mothers die
The land of dreams and satanic rites
Where trees don't hear God's lies
A whisper of doom rides the unholy night
Where darkness bathes the iced earth
Here the tears of trees find the death bed
To lay and forget to sleep and hate
When you look yourself in a mirror
You can only see my rage in your eyes
You can only see fury and hate
Conquering thy soul and mind
As the night falling over the day
I fall over you as a hammer
Smashing thoughts and dreams
And controlling you as a puppet
I the beast that never sleeps
The evil who rapes the whore
And creates the bastard Christ
Knows that the time to reign has come
I am the black blood of thy soul
And I will reborn the prince of Christians
To make him pay to make him suffer
To occupy forever the throne
Of the true soul conquerors
I am the Satanism maker
The lord of the darkest side
The eternal nightmare on thy dreams
The sword that cuts you in two
And then prepare you all for the true suffering
Because the king of bastards is prepared
Prepared to show you all the power
And the rage of the eternal damnation
I'm the thorn nailed in thy forehead
The nail that crosses thy feet and hands
The whip that lashes thy soul
The lance that impales thy entrails
I'm the king the master
Of all my possessions
I'm the server the slave
Of my sublime dominions
I'm the guardian of the door
Which hides paradise
I'm the last warrior
The one who looks to shelter my black soul
I'm the lord of the lords I'm the decay of thy gods
I'm the storm that shakes the scarecrow
The logic that moves a puppet
I'm the truth that fondles life
The lie that fondles death
I'm the fire where thy hopes burn
The air that shatter thy desires
The sea where thy faith drown
The earth raped by thy god
I'm the wolf that wanders by the deep forest
And lets flow his primitives instincts
The lamb that awaits unconscious the ritual
And buries and scorns his existence
The heaven where faith is corrupted
And thy almighty god die
The hell where abstinence is enthroned
And indulgence is buried
Lost in the nature's heart
In a immense solitude
I feel how all respect has turn to covet
In a wrapping tranquility
I feel how all reverence has turn to scorn
All the wisdom of our ancestors
Covered with blood
Rotting his entrails 
Shattering her fragile equilibrium
Our arrogance will bring the dark days
Where the sky will turn black
And mountains red
Where the tempest will turn day to night
And the waves will bath the highest mountains
Where the ground break before our steps
And its fury will tumble down the clay Gods
Dark days will come
Where death will be spread through all the earth
Where death will take us back to nature's wisdom
I will forsake the earth covered with blood
Blood of the innocent spilled
By thy sick reason and thy unholy greed
Forsake the earth engulfed in the ice
I will forsake the earth full of crosses
Crosses where faith is praised
Crosses where martyrs lay crucified
Uselessly waiting arrival of paradise
I will follow the left hand path
The path that will show me the black light
The path where hypocrisy dies in my hands
The path where lies will be buried
Lies to hide thy decay
Lies to justify thy faith
I will follow the path that purifies my soul
That make that my dark desires become reality
And thy false doctrine remain burned
And thy false wisdom remain dethronedScrutinizing
Telepathic
Exercising
My inner self
Needing
Feeding
Myself into my self
I fill myself into images
I know they don't ring true
I create a wall of thought
Opaque invisible extant not
I look into the Mirror
The Mirror looks into me
I see what I want
I want what I see
In the Mirror of Nothingness
I create a reality
It's so easy it's so free
Live in that world
That I create I mould
Push it to the extreme
Watch it grow unfold
Control every step control every fold
Deny the unpleasant resist the bold
I look into the Mirror
The Mirror looks into me
I see what I want
I want what I see
In the Mirror of Nothingness
I create a reality
It's so easy it's so free
A negative imagery is all we have 
To think of and feel to decide
Desperation on an endless road
Roll the stone relive again
And again and again
One with yourself so hard to be
Layers of hypocrisy
Adapting creating mutating unseeing
Fitting into the assembly line
Mindless thought for mindless thought
Never stopping a battle never fought
Streamlined never a thought
Searching for the kick
Of nonexistence
Of a direct link
Between yourself and your self
Your self and yourself
Meanings once known
Naivety was the cure
Once you were unseeing
Once you were pure
Actions to fit consequences
Reasons manufactured
Cover define your existence
With layers of rationales
Searching for the kick
Of nonexistence
Of a direct link
Between yourself and your self
Your self and yourself
The external hunt for consciousness
Slip from the fount of reason slip
Drunk with the pleasures of life
You miss the importance
Passivity to the actual priorities
That you know should define you
A solution probably not extant
Blindly stumbling a zombie ritual
On and end being in sight
Decide to ignore fight despise
Despise decide fly
Exploration of a mind
Spreading outward
Into the universe
Disgust fills my soul
Points of light missing
The evil urges of life
A natural state
Universal constants leave in their wake
A fusing mass of hydrogen
Chaotic entropy freewheeling through infinities of temporal states
Why consider orderly atoms as life
Why believers are we in the unknown
Why deceive ourselves with a created fate
Hang on by the tips of my fingers
To the narrow ledge of sanity
The largesse of existence
Confuses me
A dream within a dream
Innocent of comprehension
A well made model
Of a larger creation
Questioning beliefs the answer is created
Aid our insanity
To restore sanity
Lock up our minds
Deep within our selves
Safely cruise
Through the universe's bends
Need a grip on life
What the fuck is life
Pitfalls abound
You get snared in the end
Like mice in the maze
Seeking the way
Creating the way
It's eating the way
Do I
Create the mazeWhen the jews return to Zion
And a comet rips the sky
And the Holy Roman empire rises
Then you and I must die
From the eternal sea he rises
Creating armies on either shore
Turning man against his brother
'Til man exists no more
Even now he's in the world
And his power shall be mighty
And he shall prosper and be strong
And shall destroy the mighty and the holy
Burn under the protection of Satan
He was put into the world of the Christians
In the belly of a jackal that is his mother
Through his veins there flows powerful blood
He is the bringer of death
Who was prophesized by the old myths
His power will grow stronger
And he will bring about the end of the world
Through his eyes you can see the fires of hell
Beneath his hair lies the mark of the devil
On the 6th day
Of the 6th month
On the 6th hour he was born
He carries the mark of the devil
To bring about the end
The last revelation 666
Born with the mask of perdition
He represents everything that's bad in the world
In the garment of innocence
He waits for his coronation
To everyone who poses a threat horrible things happen
He gives the faithless a final proof of his existence
Only few know his true identity
The more he grows up the more powerful he gets
But he's not alone in this world
His fellowship grows year by year
With his black wings he will rise above the earth to reign
The dark power will spread around his Kingdom of Terror
The sky turns red
The flames get right
The dead will walk
The storms arise
This will be the end
The signs of the last days
This will be the time
When day turns into night
Everlasting shadows
Spread their wings above
Crawling creatures
Send from hell will kill
God is dead
Satan arise
God is dead
Satan arise
The serpent's awake
And twilight will follow
The rise of the dead
Will bring christ the end
This will be the day
When day turns into night
This will be the time the godless will rise
No one can stop them
From ending their work
A dimension of pain
Opens a new law
God you have failed
The prince of the darkness sent out his servants
To protect the son of darkness
They resemble man and beast and will risk their lives for him
Within their souls dwells the demonic
They are meant for their master
See the blackness in their eyes
The light on earth will shine no more
Armies of ravens are on his side
No one can escape their spell
Beastly rottweiler in the shadow of the night
In their muzzles greed for holy blood
They are the servants of the twilight
Ready for the fight
They are the servants of the twilight
No one can hide
They are the servants of the twilight
They keep the Christians away
They are the servants of the twilight
To protect the unholy one
With the power of the dark evil
They will rear his kingdom
Many had to die as well as his family
From the mists of perdition
They play their games
The only purpose in their lives
Is to die for him
And in the shadow of the wolf he will come
The winds to become his weapons
He will tolerate no one beside him
So he will also murder his brother
The false prophets prepare the country for his rule
His energy is reflected in their bodies
The shouting of the raven lets the world stop in it's tracks
The barking of the gods lets everything shiver with fear
And I stood upon the sand of the sea
And saw a beast rise up out of the sea
Having seven heads and ten horns
And upon his heads the name of blasphemy
And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god
To blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
Dark clouds rise as the blessed one had killed his parents
Under the care of his uncle he now learns the system of the war
He suspects what powers are within him
And that he will be the bringer of a new age
Slowly grows the kingdom of blasphemy
The new order has begun
Slowly spreads the kingdom of blasphemy
The large storm is brewing
In his heart he holds the will of destruction
It is set free more and more
Ready to extinguish everything that's holy
He will bury of that stands in his way to build his throne
Fire will burn into their limbs
And death will prevail
The creatures of hell
The demons of earth
The servants of the night
Performing bloody deeds
To carry him to the top
I am the chosen one born to reign the empire of the Christians will
disintegrate and the world will fall to darkness those who follow me will
experience pleasures my adversaries will die they will suffer eternal
agonies
burning in my fathers flames
The antichrist is among us driven by
His greed holy ground
And God's child is his fear
The only thing that can him kill are the seven daggers
But the seven chosen ones fail to destroy him
The earth will divide and the beast will rise from it
Thunder and storms announce his war
The antichrist senses that his enemy is close
The birth of the holy child is approaching
Only the seven daggers of Megiddo can kill him
The only wordly thing that can harm him
The seven signs of the apocalypse to have shown themselves
The son of the devil will be powerful
Disasters and misery draw near
The world standing close to the abyss
Armies of darkness prepare
To start the final fight
Unholy the latter days have started
The signs have proves to be true
The hole ones fear for their lives
The prophets praise their verse
The sea runs dry and the lakes become deserts
Everything moral is reserved
New crusaders are joining forces
To drive the seven daggers in his flesh
God of silence
Hear his please
Your son begs you
To support him in the final Battle
God of darkness
Give him the power
To conquer the Good
To reign over it
Driven by visions the Antichrist destroys the christ
His army will be ready for the final battle
The Nazarene walks the earth and he is to be destroyed
Everyone of them is ready to die
They are ready for armageddon war
The kingdom of God against the underworld
They are ready for armageddon war
The holy son will die this very night
They moved out to kill the holy one
So the kingdom of the lawless
The joys of hell they want to bring about
There is no price they wouldn't pay
Driven by their greed and sexual lust
Every newborn child is killed
For they don't know who is the holy child
But his adversary survives even this night
The thorns of lies against the round dance of anger
One will be beaten but evil will live on
Paradise will never be
Lust and anarchy will reign
Paradise will never be
The reign of god will fade away
He will builds his kingdom on earth
and he subject to satan
the earth will be empty and
the people will kill each other
And it was given up to him to make with the saints
and to overcome them
and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations
Old writings foretell the demise of the world Satan will rise
And the final fight between good and evil will begin
The disciples of the antichrist gather together
They want to kill the child of god
Born of this night
The believers are seduced
Many newborn children die
Only with a single thought
To destroy the bringer of light
Cold and without grace
They will hunt him
And no God can protect him
He has lost his power
In the strubs of Hebron he is revealed
The master of stillness and insanity
Will fight the last battle for his final victory
And a thousand dragons will follow him
Unholy alliance
Built to destroy
The holy energy
Never will be
Unholy alliance
A new age has begun
Pleasures of hell
Are reality
The power of his father
Lets him become stronger
On the island of angels
His adversary is born
The believers will whimper
And pray to their god
But the holy father
Grants them no more protection
The believers are seduced
Many newborn children die
Only with a single thought
To destroy the bringer of light
Cold and without grace
They will hunt him
And no God can protect him
He has lost his power
That kingdom of heaven is locked
The horns of the angels are calling to war
Swords will clash
The banished ones are seeking revenge against God
A priest of the damned
For a world of sin
The eyes of darkness
With the power to kill
I will lead you into
A kingdom of joy
Everyone coming with me
Will receive eternal life
He is the father of all sin
Of the highest desolation
Nevertheless the people long to embrace him
He will free the world of the second coming of Christ
2000 years of rulership are enough
His servants will experience the joys of hell
He is the God of Melancholy
The divinity of loneliness
The purity of evil he is
The paradise of pain he will bring
Hell does ot revel in the bowels of the earth
It is the sky of satan's ecstasy
Image of the antichrist
Image of the beast
Image of the antichrist
Image of the unholyness
And it shall come to pass that in the end days
The beast shall reign unhundred score and thirty
Days and nights
And the faithful shall cry unto the lord
Wherefore art thou in the day of evil
And the lord shall hear their prayers
And out of the angel isle he shall bring fourth a deliever
A holy lamb of god who shall do battle with the beast
But not destroy him
Born of a jackal his son descends
To suffocate the world of morality
To prevent the resurrection of the Nazarene
To establish lust and agonyThe bloody oath of raven
It's back to kill again
The shadows of the past
Will come back to take revenge
We are resurrection
We will realize
We give yo illusions
We are the devil's eyes
When emotions and fear united
And your dreams will now be real
I'm back from the dark
I'm breaking your silence
Into your nightmares
I'm back from the dark
I'm back from the dark
I'm killing your sadness
With power and violence
I'm back from the dark
The path into damnation
The silence will die
You wait for redemption
In the ravage of my lie
We are immolation
We are genocide
We give you perception
We are the dead inside
Father please forgive my sins
Prepared my soul for you
The demons in my mind
Try to share my heart in two
Please don't forget me father
To fall into oblivion
The sadness is my mother
And that's my own destruction
Now you believe and you see
The sickness in my heart
You can be
The salvation in my soul
Sacrifice me
So drink my blood to be reborn
The underworld released my soul
Sacrifice me
So give salvation to my heart
My savior in my lonely world
Satan don't let me fall
Now I stand here and call
Can you hear my bleeding soul
Blood shadows on the wall
Wake up and stop dreaming
Your real nightmares have begun
Inside you hear them screaming
Dark force awakening now to haunt
They're riding like a desert storm
The demon will you call
Until the end of dawn
The dogs of hell reborn
Black magic in the air
My heart's full of despair
The evil out there
My blood smells everywhere
The dark forces of the night
In my dreams I hear them calling
The dark forces of the night
Killing me now  killing me now
The dark forces of the night
Now my evil soul is burning
The dark forces of the night
Sacrifice my blood
The seventh sign is broken
My world will burn down and fall
Why has my God forsaken
I sold my soul forevermore
With evil I have signed a deal
Salvation for my sin
This is my last desire
From the demons and the fire
In a dark demonic fullmoon night
The masters will now call
The armies of death
Thunder and lightning and fire from the sky
They burn you to ashes
And force you to lie
A world full of blackness
A world full of pain
This is the end of his evil game
Can you hear them
They scream your name again and again
Can you feel them
That's the final attack
Satanic curses
The demons are calling your name
Satanic curses
Now you burn in Hell
Dark shadows are over your head
The gates of hell  it's open again
Thousands are coming to get his revenge
The earth drowns in blood
The riders unbound
They try to destroy and kill around
Satanic curses
The demons are calling your name
Satanic curses
Now you burn in Hell
The riders of Hell brings you hate
Satanic curses
Now death is your fate
The demons are calling your name
Satanic curses
Now you burn in flame
Your soul now is drowning in flames
The way to end it's now clear
For your smeared in your blood eyes
Betrayed and abased alone with
Your holy blackness destiny
The war in your head
The war is your death
That's the end and your deep fall
Black raven return to get his victims
Back to eternity
The hammer of war now is falling
All signs show on destruction
Forever in corruption
Evil of destruction
War flames will rise to the sky
Evil of destruction
Nothing can stop now this hate
Forever condemned to fight and suicide
For your sick own religion
With hatred and wrath
They try to destroy the God's creation
In a darkest judgment day
I can feel the hate inside again
I'm the king of my world
I feel like a beast
We will escape from his cage
With unholy rage in my head
I go find my destiny
I move in a path to prevail
I know that's the way to hell
One shout in his heart
And a new nightmare will be start
My blood flows like an ocean
As I rip my veins deep inside again
The death is under construction
With demon's blood  demon's blood
My heart bleeds full with emotions
I pray deep down on my knees again
My mind it's under confusions
With demon's blood demon's blood
The wings of death will take your breath
And let your blood drain on earth
I move in a dream full of sins
And now my nightmare will begin
One shout in his brain
And the devil takes you back again
When I close my eyes
The black birds come to hold his price
The blackness overcomes
And takes my breath away
Bloody shadows on the wall
Are trapped in an unreal world
Where the legions of the damned
Prepare the immortal souls
Incantation between two worlds
Abomination the spirits of your God's
In damnation
It's the answer of your lonely world
In the darkness and daylight
Damnation
For the faithless of your holy God's
It's your last fight of your life
I give you my last breath
And you give me eternal pain
My God forsake me
So hold me back in Hell
Through my flesh and sorrow
Black my soul and hollow
Bring me to your promised land
Lead me to my blessed end
Somewhere in the world around
We can hear the metal sound
We fight with raising swords
Beside the metal gods
We create the dragons world
And let the kingdoms fall
We are the chosen ones who fight
Against the beast
We let the legends still alive
Reborn in flesh and blood
The name it's rock n' roll
The law deep in your soul
We rock the night
We rock your life
We create the sound
That's deep in your heart
We rock your soul
We rock your world
Resurrection thoughts
Between the two worlds
Every night with flames on the stage
With the glory to th e edge
We bring the metal back
Deep inside your heart
In your head and in your soul
Have a mission you want all
Feel the vision like a raging hungry firestorm
Can you hear the children cry
Lonely screams before they die
Another day is gone with promises
And deadly crimes
Proclaimed messiahs with words
Manipulating your thoughts
They will control your life
With unreal fucking lies
Uncontrollable we destroy us all
Cry
Darkness everywhere
The future lost out there
With empty words don't let you hypnotize
Together we're strong
Together we're one
In sadness now
We will survive
Together we're here
Forever we fear
In darkness now
We will survive
Don't run away from mistakes
The death will come and takes
Alone we  standing at the abyss of despair
Now take your life in your hand
Together until the end
With endless reverence and pride
We are strong
Uncontrollable we destroy us all
With empty words don't let you hypnotize
World of lies and conviction
An evil plan will bring you death
Thousands are dying on the hill
Who stops the damned to kill
You leave only a deep cut into your heart
A lonely place with deep scars
Unholy wars
The angels try to save you
To save and hold you back
But shadows of the otherside
Bring you the last attack
The grave of the thousand lies
The real answers full of pain and sadness
The grave of the thousand lies
There's the place where the mothers cry
Don't forget the blackened days
You don't learn from your mistakes
The return will be in graves
Your blood flows in waves
His soul and heart now it's black
I hear them screaming
The spirits now forever lost
For those who are dreaming
The grave of the thousand lies
The real answers full of pain and sadness
The grave of the thousand lies
A place where life and death unite
The grave of the thousand lies
There's the place where the mothers cry
Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind
people think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late
attack fire against fire when your enemies attack you
throw the first stone before something hit you
you well know that the best defence is the attack
and shan't rest until hear the enemy's last breath
peace just will come when you triumph over the last one
eye by eye
tooth by tooth
you shall retribute evil by evil
ashes to ashes
dust to dust
the one who has made more victims will be named the new god
sometimes i've given love and haven't received anything back
you are confounding human feelings with merchandises
i've seen all my life the people doing thus
why don't you follow your own instinct of discernment 
but i've followed it
the focus of tyranny and hate
more despotic than the megalomaniac god
but he isn't a god and he is lacking his strength
now he feels the shock of the negative discharge in his mind
now i am here submerged in this mud i am the worst
an old and useless trash full of wrinkles
face our destiny watch my sad example
the world of fatality that we are creating for our fellow beings
revive yourself as me
our greatest fault is the fear to admit our wrong
hindsight won't help me to recover the time i've lost
the doors are closing wake up 
i must open your eyes to the truth
the chances are against us stand up to
the man is born as a pure and wise animal
but the society blinds him and taints him
if he become contrary to it he'll suffer like me the consequences
threatened imprisioned tortured humiliated doomed killed and
decaptated
no god no devil no one can save us from the human justice
eye by eye
tooth by tooth
destroy the false conceptions which they've trained you
ashes to ashes
dust to dust
happily for our luck the sun rises for all
it's never too late to go off the course of our life
when thou startest to shine in the east
early in the morning
my eyes sparkle like diamonds with great anxiety to see thee
then thou risest wonderfully
my eyes flow that holy human water the nectar of the gods
in thy reverence
please don't think that my tears are snares to catch thee
i do would like to imprision thee in a bottle
to have the pleasure of contemplate thee every morning
to live my last days under thy care
the mindless ones try to profane thee
they are caught in the web of ignorance
whose the net of threads they will never be able to get rid of
for the joy of few thou hastn't degenerated
becoming our vice our food our water
our blood our hope ourselves
turn thy face to earth cast us a merciful look
enlighten these poor children lost in this vale of misery
thy worshippers chant in adoration
thou art immortal
imagine if the women were like thee
thou art immortal
perhaps the earth could be a good place to live
thou art immortal
who created thee was with the dirty hands
thou art immortal
of blood milk sugar and oil
thou art immortal
thou art red meaning blood and life
thou art immortal
thou art white meaning pureness
thou art immortal
thou art sweet meaning goodness
thou art immortal
thou art black meaning the occult
i neither wanna put thee to sleep with my song
nor catch thee in the bottle
i love thee and want thee free
freedom is the essence of our eternal love
we know the secret of immortality
please never leave me alone in this dark and sorrowful world
o great magickal agent of my dreams
who inspirest me and enlightenest me
rise up express thy internal and external attributes
be red white sweet and black
i wouldn't hesitate in choose thee the most beautiful
among the goddesses
remove thy veil  the clouds show us thy face and grace
there are two ways according to the laws of the universe
one starts when the another ends
one is limited and the another is unlimited
you just know the second passing through the first
now between the sword and the cross
we shall meet it with courage
sed lex dura lex
a friend of mine
he died with a thousand of dreams in mind
to climb the stairs to heaven with honour to meet his imaginary god
a man who made never for himself and other people
is he worthy of a so wonderful end 
the law of the return  the law of the laws
it has always warned us about our insanity
now listen to the sentence for our omission
hey have a look as your corpse is so dirty
hey have a look as your spirit is so weight
black was your past is your present and wiil be your future
the earth rejects you
the heaven has closed its gates
prowl carcass and spirit through the darkness
and reflect about your sins
why must i pay for my faults now 
i'm still alive first you should doom them
i'll be the last one
i don't wanna be an example for them
i don't wanna die on the cross
it's a fruit from that same old tree
contaminated and full of worms
the cure  let's not talk about it
the fear of the unknown dismays them
sometimes the result comes late
but the consequences are worst
disincarnated still acting as a spiritless
which sentence is worst than this 
the death of an immortal
as the earth has seen the sunlight coming and going clear and dark
i've seen my idols coming i've seen my idols going
one more great gain my happiness
one more bitter loss my sadness
my losses were always unhappily greater than my gains
lost in this maze
so many pathways to be followed
what's the best solution for a senseless life
a terrible thing is a man who dies no accomplishing his goal
but the worst is one who lives without it
i hope to get something to fill this void in me
how can i occupy my mind and relieve my life from suffering and anguish
loneliness and disgust martydom and guilty 
what a shame what a human waste 
don't say that it's lack of own love
senseless life of perception
that's the way of living which i've chosen for me
conjuring the dead and adoring their images
reality and fantasy confound themselves in my mind
gods angels and saints
they've never told me what to do
creatures of stone
they don't move and tell me nothing either
i would like to materialize all my dreams and adore them
if there are dreams that are worth a life
there are lifes that aren't worth a dream
christ knew that the human race likes to adore the dead
they were needing a so called god
thinking of the immortality he died to
be adored be contemplated become an idol
candles crosses statues and the bible
they haven't got sense for me any more
i'll break all of those chains
which have hindered me for all of those years
will god comprehend me
please tell me
will my idols comprehend me
help me
now i guess i'm my own god
nobody tells me what i shall think and do
will i be able to walk with my own legs
during my existence i've made nothing for myself
if they punish me
i'm afraid
if that void grows again
i'll regret and die
how may i help you if you don't know what you want 
surrealistic visions of the new empire
the center of the world
to dominate the race to control minds
to suffocate the mass
limited intelligence prejudices of all forms  the method
to create a subrace of feebleminded  their goal
in name of god retrocede thee noxious creature
i am the cancer growing in your entrails
respect the holy laws of the supreme being
supreme in your kingdom of fear and lie
who art thou atheist satanist or what
i'm the nightmare which you had never dreamed
i curse thee in name of my lord
haahaa
changing the course of the wiser men's dream from the past
a world without boundaries without wars without leaders
creating a reality which only serve for yourselves
destroyers for the black poor
saviours for the white rich
oh shut thy face i've heard enough
the truth sounds like thunders in your ears
we are dying our empire fell through
but the wounds still aren't healed up
we are victims lucifer deceived us
don't use it as a scapegoat to justify your crimes
i beg thy mercy for my excesses
listen to the voice of one who you've hurted for centuries
free from you  now we can breathe
free from you  now we can think
free from you  now we can dream
free from you  now we can act
triumph without blood
victory without corpses
may we deal my defeat with thy victory to live together again 
it's a small world for me and you
all the heroes are dead what doest thou wanna prove 
i shall free the last birds from the cage
damned be thy existence and who have created thee
your senseless words sounds like a joke for me
but i still can save thy soul just give me all thy wealths
why simoniac  i am free from you 
alone in this room without light
i don't know if it is day or night
they've drugged me day after day
my friends are the phantoms of my nightmares
but i will try to solve this problem
someone shall hear my pitiful cries
wrapped in this endless silence
if you are hearing my plea
please bring me the key
open that door  take me out from this place
save me  if you may not do it i'll commit suicide
i think that's the only way to escape from this
none from heaven has heard me
i've turned my back to them
if someone anywhere help me
i will pawn him my considerable love knowhow
this is my only wealth which i can barter for my freedom
illusion  this is one of the many drugs i've used
imagination  it is the way to survive in this
horrible and empty place
am i dreaming or becoming crazy 
a source of light is growing
from the corner of the ceiling
that is coming to me
i'm trembling with fear
the apparition scares me
does that bring me something
to rescue me from this desolated isle 
if it is a dream i hope don't awake
i'll face the unknown
to return to the world
to recover my sanity
to see again my parents
to meet again my friends
be as the destiny likes
i'm the moon
the key which will open that door for you
my messenger azaradel will teach you a moonick spell
now close your eyes sleep and dream
reveal him your occult desire
at midnight when the moon be full
face her and whispper the following words
as thou influencest the tide and men's mind
open the doors of the destiny for me
as thy face shinest in the dark
my desires shall realize
matter and spirit are incompatible
i don't know if it'll accomplish
but who knows 
every door is opening
the spell became true
he is free to fly high
higher than his dreams
bright as a star
the loneliness torn me into pieces
but thou hast helped me
now i am here to fulfil my promise
now you close your eyes why 
because i'm going to make rain on the moonDarkness entwine she is night and is mine
Horn in the silence spawned forth from the abyss
Her immortal soul wrought with sloth bought and sold
Her heart wrenched with pain that the whore doth sustain
See her breast heave it's last breath no more
Bewitchment of weakness thy wings spread in restlessness
He may be history thou art folklore
Silence shrouds her necromantic phantasies
She painteth upon the midnight winter chill
Movements languid a specter and a ghostly shade of grey
She breaths unease into the hearts of man and gently molds his will
The bitch bath heritage in feminine wake
Spells cast from the bonfires burn masculine skies
With stars as the kindling the smoke chokes the siblings
Of equality praise forthcoming demise
Rise from thy grave dawn thy wretched remains
As a cloak to thy form thou art true
Claim your throne of witchcraft my gothic queen
Now the goddess she eth striketh with deviltry pure and new
Returned she cums in anger to claim sex as her own
Divine is the lesbian murderous slut
Hamlet mistake in frailty's form
Carmilla prevails when on trial for her evil
But somewhere between the violence and the violins
A rose for the dead grows in Lucifer's garden
A flower of hate from the jezchel soil
What death makes stronger will rise when the leminine awake
Deviltry thy name is a woman there is wine
In the vaginal chalice of truthwhere hast thou been
Cursed is the daughter of the darkest tomb
Of innocence it was created of such phallic fallacies
Heart as blacketh as the starless night
She shuns her counterpart bred as an unfortunate flaw of nature
See how she haunts the hallowed halls of her story
Dastardly deeds of a girl and her scorn
Becoming a poltergeist tragic and triumphant
Mistress of pleasure your legend is born
A breed of a vampyric sexual creed
Populate in new ways she shall find
The men may conspire but all will expire
Just ashes and agony trailing behind
Succubus suck the Earth
Shadows are the lost and drowned
A gift for me to resist the dawn
A breaking voice these waves in the air
Call me hence in a patient stare
In timeless beauty
Caught within the passing ring
Ideas that should not come to me
Pondering this lifeless dream of mine
I will awake to find my concubine
In timeless worldsALIVE
Make these consequences dissipate
I no longer wish to adhere to reason
Take these understandings from my mind
I need to feel this spiritual disarray
Divine are the thoughts that render me
Capable of sense and sight
A vicious carnivore this wind
Lick my wounds my sins rescind
Dispel my fear this
Night where I find her face
Comfort here in her embrace
The cloudless shelter bares my swoon
In the loving arms of Miss Construe
In timeless worldsALIVE
Make these consequences dissipate
I no longer wish to adhere to reason
Take these understandings from my mind
I need to feel this spiritual disarray
Follow the words I hear her say
I only want to hear her sounds
Layeth me before the break of day
Oh but to feel the baying of the sleepless hounds
The heavens are ablaze with fear
And as haunted as my gaze
The silhouette of my intentions
Can be seen through this dark and dreadful baze
From immortal Eden to me hequeath
Throw unto me your jagged spells
Forever is a dream and dream I shall
A promise so vain so true sleep well
Through the catacombs fallen
Through a void so deep and rank
The harshened realm wrapped in sharpening winds
Thusly raped by the thorns of discontent
Walking through the worlds blind
Corrupt and consuming me
Sharing secrets this tender heart of mine
Walking through the nefarious land of time
Wandering interests benign
Tearing secrets speaks to heart of things
Die if I shall in this phantasy
Necromancer dance to a flame that lures
Shadows from their hiding
A cruel embrace like lovers from a tragedy
A lost servant to the breath of thy nemesis
Lurking in every caress this bitter temptation
Disguised beneath her sweetened cunt
Flower of passions through air to breath
Spores of illusion pollute my weeds
Weaving through the hands of redemption
This eve will glisten with the dew of this new world
Under spells cast by moon light I welcome this parasite
Into my temple of carnal light
Night sees the fallen and bloodshed that takes away
The crying eyes of tradition and it's valor
Brandish weapons so steel can lead the way
One against the other won't take these feelings away
Lost within the looking glass
It becomes one of the hour
Time has become a helpless slave
To the rhythm of the falling grains
Sandy dunes of explanation blow to the other side of reason
Escape the tidex of virtue
For they know not the needs of the human heart
And of the sky it becomes a canopy of the loud and leather wings
The moon hath cast a shadow blood red upon the beach of better things
The calender beseeches them to enter dusk with a breath of freedom
And the night cries in return
A bitter concern for the reckless youth
In every age there lives a villain to be sure
How far were we from my imagination
If there shall be passion in my venom
And truth in my lover's eyes
Then a reign in evil I shall see and paradise between my thighs
There must have been some other way without the history
And conquest plays a dagger to the bitter back of reason
Drones of bravery loose all they have gained
Worthy if risked in the glowing face of treason
For they have endured the hardships of a new and vile belief
Eating and drinking of the zodiac delusions innocent fair but forewarned
Star crossed lovers break free of this torment
Elude the guards of the past regime
Off to the east toward the howling wolves of dawn
For in their flame there is a brightness with purpose simple and pure
It shall exist now and forever solely for them and for their pleasure
Bringer of light illuminate the path they walk with a peaceful grin
Lost in a burning they drift into yearning their hearts will sustain them in
sin
For sin will always see you home
Expose me what you want me to see so clearly
see through your jaded eyes
Wrap your intentions in cellophane
Protected yet on display
Ease the tensions and Shakespeare plays
I've heard enough of this dramatic reprise
Hearts bearing sleeves are stylish seenes
Grow where they know they can be seen
Hives have taken rightful place
Friend to friend pollinate
My hatred doesn't go away
It just gets older
Give away to royalty
Smile toxic teeth shine so poignantly
Everything's coming up roses
Dirt under fingernails
Comedy myths and tragedies
Collection of useless feelings and pride
Overcompensate for spaces in between
The gorge into which you fall
The Heroes always die in the end
As the stories you tell go
Plant a flower in his head
I hope the artist is dead
Too fat for me to see
Around your worthless feelings
Everyone that casts of your emotional distress
By blackened soul your love was told
To release your dancing prancing ignorance and all it holds
I have but one a feeling bad but none
Will you keep me from destroying all the art that you create
How dare you even that I would give a shit
About the very things that you hold dear my agenda will have you
Shake in fear of my antiartistic pride
Tis the middle of the night by the castle clock
And the owls have awakened the crowing cock
Tuwhit Tuwhoo
And bark again the crowing cock
How drowsily it crew
This exquisite child of the Baron roams
Through the forest mesmerized by moonlight alone
Here she dreams in fear for her betrothed knight
Until her prayers are torn asunder by a moan of fright
What evil secrets lie behind the giant oak
A desperate vision of female perfection dressed in white
She glittered to the eye sensual and luminescent
She seems to glow she seemed to glow
How did she come to the lands of Sir Leoline
Will her prayers protect her night so well
Hush healing heart of Christabel
Revealed to her upon the asking of maiden lost
The name of Geraldine and the story of
Crime against a lady of noble line
For she did tell a strange and frightful tale with voice so sweet
She shall enchant she will entrance
Her glow would cast a shadow that would
Swallow the sweet child whole
A willing audience here in the wood shrouded cold
Left to wait in brisk midnight by dark and faceless rouges
She makes demand on thy lady's hand
To see this maiden home
Together women of night make haste for candlelight
To the estate of Sir Leoline to hell it chimes
To rest her there for the evening to pass unfold
Over the moat to the gate of his chivalry bold
Geraldine fell sweet Christabel
Carry her over the threshold well
Though up she came as if she never were in pain
Past the hearth and into the view of the portrait of Baron
But when the lady passed
There came a tongue of light and a fit of flame
Thy temptress is divine
Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare
And jealous of the listening air
They steal their way from stair to stair
Now in the glimmer and now in the gloom
And now they pass the Baron's room
As still as death with stifled breath
And now they have reached her chamber door
And now Geraldine doth press down
The rushes of the chamber floor
Christabel trims the light
And makes it bright again
The forlorn maiden drinks
A wild flower wine for Geraldine
Standing now in pride she summons her savior
Quoth Christabel so let it be
And as the lady bade did she
Her gentle limbs dis he undress
And lay down in her loveliness
And as she lay in wait
Her heart will race for the night to wait for
A sinful view she keeps
As robes fall to the maiden's feet
Eves that burn the soul
She lay beside this latest prize
And in her words she doth told
Her prisoner in arms she holds
In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell
Which is lord of thy utterance Christabel
Thou knowest tonight and wilt know tomorrow
This mark of my shame this seal of my sorrow
Sunrise
Oh what evil night was this
To wake the morn in sinful bliss
Her look askance seethes disease
For the dawn hath no rest when by sin she pleased
With tear for if her mother near
A watching angel hath no fear
From her death she came from her desire
To be loved returned by this noble sire
But now upon the waking moans of dawn
Her magic lay me still at mouth
Anxious mements with the drawing in of breath
Be still my beating hear for it doth quake beneath my breast
My father kind and strong for now he gaze upon
The beauty that stands before his noble grace
Her name and face ring familiar
A lost friend by poisoned words
So long ago buy now his daughter here
The Bard he bade make haste
To right the words of time lost wrongs
To move swiftly and carry verse to his dear lost friend
But the Bard awaits to tell a tale a dream to him last night
A dove with voice of mine as upon it's neck a snake doth feed
And swelled it's neck as if swelled hers
Christabel escapes the dying trance of beauty
And gains her senses paused and silently prayed
She dare not allow the unholy passions reign
As she doth fall to the Barron's feet
So by her father's countenance she may be saved
Here upon the castle floor she cries in bitter anguish
Her secrets of the passing night she dare not tell
Sweet Chrstabel doth pleads for her father to heed her wishes
Upon her lost mother's seal to send the creature
Back to the night from whence it came
Within the Baron's heart and brain
If thoughts like these had any share
They only swelled his rage and pain
And did but work confusion there
His heart was cleft with pain and rage
His cheeks they quivered his eyes were wild
Dishonored thus in his old age
Dishonored by his only child
And all his hospitality
To the wronged daughter of his friend
By more than woman's jealousy
Brought thus to a disgraceful end
He rolled his eye with stern regard
Upon the gentle minstrel bard
And said in tones abrupt austere
'Why Bracy Dost thou loiter here
I bade thee hence' The bard obeyed
And turning from his own sweet maid
The aged knight Sir Leoline
Led forth the lady Geraldine
Heave spoke to her
Celestial voice bestowed upon Resurrection Mary
Defiant and Proud
The girl speaks out loud so the world my hear her praying
So You have been here then I resent your intentions
Altered this course of events for which I shall never have the process to
forgive
Be still my heart it shall beat for no other
Your judgment flawed with selective prosecution
No phantom virtue will control my fate it is my own
And never will you rape me and enslave my precious soul
I choose to
Burn in hell she demands
Never to languish in netherworlds of pettiness and lies
For there is no rest in Zion
His infernal majesty will protect the night for her to see
For then for now forever
The Shaman of Shadows lived within her from the start
The beast it grew impatient
For when in Hell she shall be no slave and sirens sing with wicked tongue
And her I lay in the throws of anticipation
Of the darkest light of legend
So secure and welcomed with a breath of eternity
Brief is the moment of clarity but it is a strong as death is certain
For my ride will be short my words spoken softly in a haze of sprite
I'm feeling so empty inside
When the fragments of pain return from the back of my mind
Of all of the lies I've been told We love you must be the worst
I couldn't find any reason to stay
My life is too precious to sacrifice
The darkest of shadows follow my soul
Tonight I will join all lost ones on the run
I have to run away
I'm all alone in this world
When the memories arise and punch a new hole in my soul
I'm hiding my head in my hands for the fragments to disappear
I wait for the nightfall eager to leave
I whisper goodbye to the house of fear
Watching my sister cry in her sleep
One day she will understand
I know I'm scarred for life
all messed up with no place to go
I'm out here all alone
Lonelier than the streets I wander
I'll always have these scars inside
I'm scarred for life
I'm lost in the cold of the night
Looking for shelter until the dawn turns to day
I'm holding my hands to my head
For the silence to reappear
The fragments and places remembered with fear
Never to leave just fade away
I'll carry them with me forever and a day
Just like a nail in my heart
So lonely  feeling so alone in the dark
The world is really fierce out here
I'm so alone and scared
I'm tired and the cold is getting to my bones
Everything is so unreal fighting on my own
My heart is pounding fast
So lonely  thinking of the end I'm soon to see
Keeping all my tears inside leaving all the world behind
I don't know where to run
Oh I don't know where to go from here
I don't know right from wrong
I just have to carry on
Awakened by a stranger looking down at me
Another soul on the run
Telling me his heart is glad to find me
Together we will try to make it out alive
I see the horror in his eyes his story isn't far from mine
We don't know where to run
Oh we don't know where to go from here
We don't know right from wrong
We just have to carry on
We don't know where to run
Oh we don't know where to go from here
The dreams we have inside will come true and we will be reborn tonight
I've found a friend
Someone that is sharing my pain
Now I know that there is something good in all this darkness
We are throwing all our fears into the fire
Life for us has only just begun
The two of us so young and so wild
We can't find the cure to what has led us astray
Far apart from what we once were
and we both made a choice there's no turning back from here
There's no turning back from here
But we have no aim just keeping up the pace
Who's the best of us who's the stronger one
Will it ever end
This escalating game
We're reborn to live on the edge
Who's the bravest of us
Who will live to tell
I'm so scared of what we've become
As we double the bets the proportions exceed ourselves
The proportions exceed our sanity
We have gone from meek to brave
And we're chasing a dream that never will come true
Letting go of all our fears
The unavoidable end is the enemy we defy
But we have no aim just keeping up the pace
Who's the best of us who's the stronger one
Will it ever end
This escalating game
There can be only one
The rain is cold as ice today
The day I never wanted to come
We have come to the final round
We have reached the point of no return
I can see that you're afraid but there is no way out
You are the one to show the way
This is the final dare
I know this could be your last day
I place the rope around your neck
I can see the anguish in your eyes
No My breath is swept away by the sight I see
I cannot move I cannot scream Oh No
He chokes for breath in vain
I fail to cut the rope in time
The game is over now
His broken soul is lost for evermore
I feel his soul far away
A part of me has died
I wonder who's to show the way
He left this world behind
I feel his soul far away
A part of me has died
I wonder who's to show the way
My heart is in pain
Surrounded by emptiness
How could I do this to my only friend
The memories of joy vanished without a trace
Wandering aimlessly
Empty inside
I know I'll never be be myself again
Death and despair is forever to dwell in my soul
It's never to leave me no
I feel so alone
Guilt is written all over me
I'm losing myself in this maze of remorse
Please wake me up from the nightmare that's haunting me
I only see darkness wherever I turn
I know he'll never be be alive again
Death and despair is forever to rhyme with my name
I can't stand the pain any longer
Lonely
Losing time and space
I am reborn in remorse and regret
Oh no sight of light inside
The darkness is all around
I'm calling your name
I wish you could see me now
But only my echo is with me tonight
You know I would trade my life for your return
But you'll never hear this promise I make
I know I'll never be be myself again
And the tears that I cry is the lifeblood I stole from your eyes
I can't stand the pain any longer
Lonely
Losing time and space
My soul is reborn in remorse and regret
Oh no sight of light inside
The darkness is all around
My world is insane
I surrender to silence
But will I be able to bury the truth
I'm all alone
Waiting for no one
I see the daylight fade away
I'm so afraid
I know you're around me
I hear you crying in the wind
If I could bring you back
If I had the power I'd give you my world
And my life you'd have it all
But life is not a game
And I know the rules and I know I must follow
them every single day
I feel that I'm loosing it all
There's nothing left to live for
I'm ending it all in my dreams
It always seems so easy in my sleep
I'm all alone
Waiting for darkness
I wish the sun would slip away
I still believe that you didn't leave me
I see your shadow in the haze
If I could have some peace
Ending the nightmare closing the chapter
And join you in your sleep
But life is not a game
And I know the rules and I know I must follow
them every single day
I feel that I'm loosing it all
There's nothing left to live for
I'm ending it all in my dreams
And deep inside I knew
That there was one part of me
That tried to save you from yourself
The other let you go and I will
Never deny I was walking on the line of
Here and nevermore in selfish pride
Day and night just come and go
I hate that life is so deceiving
I feel this urge to turn away
From all the sadness and grieving
I find my way back to the place where we parted
All I hear is my heart pounding inside
I'm so afraid of what I'll see when I return
There's a part of me that needs to say goodbye
Until we meet again
Now and then he reappears
In my dreams
In my illusions
Pointing out the chosen path
It feels so real
Am I really dreaming
Soon I'll see what time has done to my creation
Hell on Earth is just a few steps away
The Sun is hiding
I am in the heart of darkness
I'm closing in on the godforsaken tree
The moment I defy the pain
Is here again in another way
All the fear in my life
Is erased from my soul
I never knew that my fantasies
Could be oh so close to reality
And what I see here right now
Is so hard to believe
I see the rope my friend is gone
His body's nowhere to be found
I hear him whisper in the wind
I hear him calling out my name
Am I going insane
The moment I defy the fear
Is here again I can feel he's near
All the fear in my life
Have returned to my soul
I never knew that my fantasies
Could be oh so close to reality
And what I'm hearing right now
Is so hard to believe
Darkness all around me I believe
That we will be together once again
The time has come to leave this dreadful place
I think I've found a way out of this maze
Tonight the moon will shine upon my grave
God has failed Here's one he cannot save
My life is over I just can't go on
Nowhere to run I'm turning black inside
I hope to meet him in the other sky
I've realized I'm only born to die
I close my eyes and ask myself again
Is there really nothing left to do
The silence in my heart just prove me right
Soon my journey will begin towards eternal night
I'm breathing water death is closing in
It's cold and dark but I am not afraid
I'm out of breath There's no way out of here
This is the end of all the pain and fear
I lie here by the lakeside
I am still alive somehow
It's all too strange for me to understand
How could someone see me
In the darkness of the night
How could someone bring me back to life
Is there another world
Dead or alive
Oh life is haunting me
I can't describe the feeling
Could it all just be a dream
I'm still wet and the memories remain
I rise and try to make my way back to the normal world
I'v realized that life has to go on
It's so hard to decide
Dead or alive
Now fear will carry me back to the world
Another day is dawning
Now my journey will begin
Destined to return to normal life
It feels like I've been out here
For eternity and more
I've lost all sense of time
But I'll be strong
It's so hard to decide
Dead or alive
Oh my past is haunting me
My heart never wanted to leave
The silence was gold for my soul
But I am heading back home I return
To the world that I decide to leave
My life is a waste of time
I wish I could end it
But something won't let me go
I'm back everything looks the same
All these people but I still alone
I'm soon to arrive at the place where my fear was born
Torn torn apart
The scars are still bleeding inside
I'll never forgive you
One part of me always cry
And it's crying 'cause of you
So long ago
I gave you my heart it was
So long ago
I gave you my soul it was
So long ago
But you gave me hell in return
You made what I am here today
All the sadness you brought to my soul
Is something I'll never find ways to defy
If you could see me what you've done to me now
Maybe you would understand 
The love you never gave me
Would have made me much stronger inside
But it is too late to change
So long ago
I gave you my heart
So long ago
And I gave you my soul
So long ago
And I gave you I gave you my heart
So long ago
But you gave me hell in return
I'm back where the darkness began
All is empty not a soul around
Where are you now
Where did all of you go
Nothing is left
Nothing is left from before
It seems like a lifetime has passed here
While I was gone
Always standing quiet in the shadows
Waiting for the perfect time
Always watching from a striking distance
Ready for the crime
In control of every situation
Good appearence very polite
After finishing another victim
He's gone and out of sight
He's a modern vampire
He feeds on our energy
He will totally drain you
Before turning his eyes on me
Flying high on stolen wings
Filling his heart with your fear and pain
On the move all night and day
Searching the grounds for an easy prey
He's a master of infiltration
He can blend in everywhere
Never Showing his real intention
The reason why he's here
So remember to look over your shoulder
Be prepared to call his lies
And if you ever think now it's over
You will be surprised
He's a modern vampire
He feeds on our energy
He will totally drain you
He will never set you free
The deep humiliation
Following his trail
Stealing your creations
Leaving you to fail
All your work for nothing
All your dreams are gone
See hime claim your glory
When his work is done
Broken spirit on your knees
Holding the pieces of what used to be
Everything you struggled for
Living will never be the same no more
Flying high on stolen wings
Filling his heart with your fear and pain
On the move all night and day
Searching the grounds for an easy prey
For an easy prey
He was one of the few when it all began
When creation still was new
With a task to fulfil to obey and serve
And always follow through
He stayed loyal and true
And then out of the blue
It all just went astray
Something went wrong just a slip of his tongue
Enough to punish him sentenced to stay
And to rule in a bottomless hole
Take me at my word when I say
He was given hell to pay
What can he ever do to leave that place
Forever be free abandon his throne
When will he hear the words
Just let it go It's over and done
It's time to come home
Hopes they can hear all the cries
From the souls he has gathered there
They're feeding the fire
But why does he still feel so cold
Waiting here for aeons of time
Waiting to redeem his crime
What can he ever do to leave this place
Forever be free abandon his throne
When will he hear the words
Just let it go It's over and done
It's time to come home
It's time to come home
In his dreams he travels back again
To the time when they could talk
When no one ever called him Morningstar
Who's descending to the dark
The only time he dared to speak his mind
And to question what was planned
The servant from the early dawn of time
Now inferior to man
He never wanted it to go this far
But he refused to be replaced
He knows he never can come back again
He's still falling away from grace
He'll never come home again
Falling still falling away from grace
Oh he's still falling away
Falling still falling away from grace
He has fallen from grace
Take me at my word when I say
He was given hell to pay
What must I ever do to leave this place
Forever be free abandon my throne
When will I hear you say
Just let it go It's over and done
It's time to come home
Seeing it all but do we really understand
The consequence of choosing to ignore
Or is it just a paralysing state of mind
No one seems to bother anymore
Still we try to keep our sleeping conscious clean
But doing right has never been more wrong
The world will spin for one more day
That's what we pray for anyway
And as the clouds turn dark and grey
We are only chasing the storm away
And it's bound to return
Keep moving on
With no care about the aftermath
Leaving the bill for someone else to pay
The future is not too bright
In fact it's filled with wrath
We turn our heads and look the other way
The world will spin for one more day
That's what we pray for anyway
And as the clouds turn dark and grey
We are only chasing the storm away
You can choose all the winners
But the game is not the same
When the rules don't matter anymore
And the saints and the sinners
They will bow their heads in shame
When the truth come crashing through the door
The world will spin for one more day
That's what we pray for anyway
And as the clouds turn dark and grey
We are only chasing the storm away
And it's bound to return
The world will spin for one more day
But we are only chasing the storm away
He saw nothing
The night kept its secret well
A storm was raping the sky
A premonition his reign heading for the end
And there was no time to hide no
One ship after another they came ashore
A fleet of death and despair
In formation and silence they tread his land
In the name of power and greed
From overseas they'd come
For riches and for might
The Warriors of the Dawn
The Warriors of the Dawn
Killed or enslaved everyone
At first morning light
The king had lost his crown
By his blood they were renown
By his blood they were renown
Without warning
As swiftly as lightning strikes
Another battle begun
In great numbers
Forcing all barricades
Set cities ablaze
From overseas they'd come
For riches and for might
The Warriors of the Dawn
The Warriors of the Dawn
Killed or enslaved everyone
At first morning light
The king had lost his crown
By his blood they were renown
From overseas they'd come
For riches and for might
The Warriors of the Dawn
From overseas they'd come
For riches and for might
The Warriors of the Dawn
The Warriors of the Dawn
Would unleash hell to serve their gods
And bathe in delight
Empires were struck down
By blood they were renown
By blood they were renown
Mountains of silver
And oceans of gold
The fruits of war irresistible
The slaughter would never end no
Her face was smiling her bright eyes were filled with tears
A people's temple were crowded she felt no fear
And then she saw him a man in white
He came so close she touched him with her hand
And when she heard him all doubts were gone
I really think he is a chosen one
I see Your fate I give salvation
I'll save your mortal soul Forevermore
Just drink my wine this bitter potion
And bring an end to all Forevermore
I can't believe that I am here bloom new paradise
And everyone will see it
See as I watch You'll hate us all shame we are lost
I count for all eternity yeah
The morning sun is cold she takes a place in mine
The final hour strikes and darkness fills her mind
Where will he see through no one can tell
The doors of heaven or the gates of hell
I see Your fate I give salvation
I'll save your mortal soul Forevermore
Just drink my wine this bitter potion
And bring an end to all Forevermore
Already unusual as we grew inside the womb
On the outside the people prayed
That it wouldn't be our tomb
The time had come to be born into this world
And now we breathe the air
In this new world we've entered
Now we're here on the other side
Forever together as one
But not sharing sould and mind
It appears I'm the weaker one
I was born with a useless heart
My lungs do not breathe the air
To support my feeble mind
Life goes on and now the facts are clear
I'm the leech hanging on to you for survival
Now here on the other side
Though we're together as one
It seems like I wear us down
And something needs to be done
Here on the other side
People will have to decide
Whether we live or die tonight
Oh no
We lie on the table eyes all around
I wait for my end to begin
Will there be darkness or will there be light
I guess I am soon to find out
In time there will be no more doubt
Oh suddenly torn apart
Leaving me lifeless and cold
And I feel how I fade away
My spirit remains in the room
And seeing you're still alive hurts
But I know what is done
Was a heartbreaking choice
Because united we stand but divided I fall
Their destination The Kingdom of Ice
A hell that already froze over
The roar of the engine
The smell of the sea
The captain and crew celebrate
They're on their way
Many before them had witnessed the might
And the cold in this desert in white
Unveiling the mysteries unknown to man
A quest for the breathtaking sight
By endurance we conquer he said
As they slowly made way to their goal
The ship carried on through the wild open sea
With everything under control
They're on their way
Then the mighty Atlantic
A beast no one can tame
Showed its most combative side
The waves ever rising
No mercy in sight
Drifting off course all the time
Held by the chains of the wind
And the green heart is punished by ice
Sadly adrift on a treacherous sea
They fear there might be no return
But they carry on
Days from their goal
A miscalculated decision
Imprisoned by ice
So close to open water
Dreams cruble to dust
As the sun sank below the horizon
The long winter began
Months of perpetual darkness
Then the sea came to life
But Endurance gave up to the torment
They abandoned ship
And hurriedly made their escape
Further away from land
Than where when they started
Tormented by hunger and thirst
Losing their faith
Facing disaster
After a year on the ice
Finally land was in sight
Safe on the island a few men decide
On a journey to find their salvation
Luck and their knowledge of stars
Brought them to their destination
Arranged for the rescue of the ones left behind
All men were brought back alive
Someone said he gave his soul
To the king of where hell fires burn
And he got the blues in return
A crossroad midnight rendezvous
For a slice of the fortune and fame
But sadly it all stayed the same
A street corner serenade
Spread with the wind to an enchanted crowd
With merciful hearts
Some people thought otherwise
And jealousy arose and venomous alcohol
Was drunken in rage
He slowly decays the poison dilutes the soul
Bringing him closer to the end
Unaware of the legacy he's leaving behind
And what a legend that he will become
Is it a curse or just a conincidence
That after twenty seven years
All of his dreams would be taken away
But his spirit lives on to this day
His rivals said He had it all
Mastery out of this world
Destined to redefine art
Knew how to kiss the sky
He was bolder than love
Spellbound the third stone from the sun
Up from the skies to the top of the world
Enjoying the stardom in every possible way
The wind cries change
The curse of the genious dragging him
Down into the dark
Where no one can follow or pull you away
A bright burning star is led astray
Into his own purple haze
The wine and the sedatives
Unite in the poison of demise
And a night in September
His bleeding heart drowned
Now it's his turn to ride with the wind
Like he came out of nowhere
Shot to fame overnight
Changed the limelight from colour to grey
Leader of the sonic revolution
Plagued with pain and depression
A man at war with himself
Didn't like what his world had become
Slowly consumed by the darkness inside
Lost and falling apart
He found the remedy at the barrel of a gun
And as he had written
It's better to burn out than to fade away
The perfect mind
A math machine
The one to rule them all
Ripping through equations
Like no man had done before
Scientist anarchist
Born to lead the way
Unveiled the truth behind the numbers
Never seemed to fail
Then it came
Like clouds in the open sky
He could see the bridges burning
Tore him down
Slowly denied him life
Never thought that it would end this way
Lost in the Maze of the Mind
Oh he's fading away
No Lost in the Maze of the Mind
A place of fear and dismay
All alone with teary eyes
He stares into the night
Memories are flashing by
And then just disappear
Nevermore to feel the joy
Of when all is adding up
The logicdefying multiplying
Withering away
Night or day
It doesn't matter now
Where he's gone no rules apply
No Lost in the Maze of the Mind
Oh he's fading away
No Lost in the Maze of the Mind
A place of fear and dismay
Sometimes it seem like it would turn around
And maybe his mind found a way
To navigate through this infernal place
And return to the real world again
But thn he caves
Something is string inside
Pulling him right back into the maze
Lost in the Maze of the Mind
Oh he's fading away
No Lost in the Maze of the Mind
A place of fear and dismay
Lost in the Maze of the Mind
Now he's lost all control
Oh no the legend has faded away
The reaper came for his toll
There was something inside of him
About to fall apart
Drifted closer to the edge
Couldn't still his bleeding heart
All doors had closed on him
The riddles would not solve
Weakened he just shut his eyes
Let the darker side evolve and prevail
Quickly and quietly he faded
As he lost the strength to carry on
It never seemed worth all pain
He had fought in vain
Inside the darkness he would stay
The moment his soul turned cold and jaded
And his will to live had died and gone
The only way out came clear had to disappear
And lose the dead weight on the ground
The echoes of a dream
Was all that he would be
His puzzled mind could never find
A good reason for his time
He realized too late
We assemble our own fate
It's sad to say so much easier
To erase than to rewind
A note that he left behind it said
Nothing here is true
This world was never meant for me
But I'm sure I'll find mine too
The absence within his mind
Was present all the time
The burden from a grain of sand
Was too heavy to withstand
The moment his soul turned cold and jaded
And his will to live had died and gone
The only way out came clear had to disappear
And lose the dead weight on the ground
The echoes of a dream
Was all that he would be
His puzzled mind could never find
A good reason for his time
He realized too late
We assemble our own fate
It's sad to say so much easier
To erase than to rewind
Living came to a state
Of merely staying alive
The house of cards caved in
A better deal next timeClassrooms are fool but your lessons are so far
Since you dreamed one day to play guitar
I've been talked about by so many friends and now
Your favourite band's gonna play in the town
I feel something special when I see those teenagers
Running out from school to the show
It seems nothing has changed and it makes me remember
As I was few years ago
Get up of your seat join the crowd
Get up get the beat oh yeah
Get up of your seat trust a crowd
Get up get the beat oh yeah
Classrooms are fool but your life is outside
And you wanna see the sunshine in your eyes
They stole your brain but your heart stays for the night
Where there's no teachers where we trust a crowd
I feel something special when I see all those teenagers
Running out from school to the show
It seems nothing has changed and it makes me remember
As I was few years ago
6 o'clock my job is done and I walk in the streets
Girls don't care I'll become the man I've dreamed to be
Come back home come back hell turn on the radio
I start to dance with myself face to face with the mirror
Waiting for the twilight my time will come
To shine in the light of rock'n roll
Waiting for the twilight my time will come
To shine in the light of rock'n roll
Come on I play the man driving girls crazy
And soon all those pretty girls seem to me so crazy
Then I will stop to play those games of sounds and steel
All what I have to say is the loneliness I feel
I pay for my precious life my past is still haunting me
There's no way to die for all eternity
My life is made of toys please god say my soul can be saved
Pray for the little boy lost in the light of day
Out of the way through the rays of the light
She used to sell what all men want to buy
She makes a gleam of delight shining on every guy's mind
Standing on the streets she throws you a little smile
She says give you my lips if you're ready to pay the price
But I've seen it in her eyes she would like another life
But today's too late too late
Today's too late to change
Today's too late your way
Today's too late
She wanted to be free so free so she fell down in this sad jail
And she cries when she sees a red light shining on a daze
Out of the way on the rays of the light
She used to sell what all man want to buy
On the edge of the night you were ready to die
They caught you by surprise challenge you with a sight
While awaiting for hell they locked you in a cell
And they switched on the flame burning down in your brain
You'll see from the skies like a blinding light
Remember the time when you were running wild
Running wild
Can you hear a message written down in your grave
The meaning of your death so hard and so restless
You can send on your way at the gleam of the day
They make you loose your mind and forever you'll be blind yeah
You'll see from the skies like a blinding light
On the edge of the night you were ready to die
They caught you by surprise challenge you with a sight
While awaiting for hell they locked you in a cell
And they switched on the flame burning down in your brain
Drive on a way 'til the end of the day 'til the middle night
The noise of the wheels the crash of the steel will echo in the sky
You're ready to win only livin' in the power and the rage
For the sake of speed you're still runnin' to lie in your grave
Look around you everywhere see the danger now you dare
It's the same old game that you always play
When the sun is going down
The same old game the same all the days
Won't you change the road you're on
Now accelerate and play with your fate 'til the early morning light
Follow the line just like a blind who's no chance to survive
You feel your race as a flight in space but you're no more than a dust in the wind
Can you hear the bells calling you to hell where you fell because of your sin
Look around you everywhere see the danger now you dare
It's the same old game that you always play
When the sun is going down
Drive on a way 'til the end of the day and you will see the fire
The noise of the wheels the crash of the steel will echo in your mind
You're ready to win only livin' in the power and the rage
For the sake of speed you're still runnin' to lie in your grave
Look around you everywhere see the danger now you dare
It's the same old game that you always play
When the sun is going down
The same old game the same all the days
Won't you change the road you're on
A nasty day of winter 1929 he's got to take the joystick got to send the mail
It's bad weather and his hands are cold as ice
He knew the danger but he knew he had to try
To fly to America crossing the stars
Braving the fire as want to make it die
When we tried to call him after midnight
There was no on on the radio no sign of life
Then we started to look for him everywhere
People swore than he has vanished in the air
Fly to America guess livin' in the stars
We used to call him the lord of the sky
Fly to America guess livin' in the stars
We used to call him the lord of the sky
The lord of the sky
Listen once upon a time a fairy came on my way
She told me which record to buy to find a way to learn to sing
I was no more than a child and they got the world still stay on my lips
Sweet child in time in the dark in the black knight you will shame
Lazy girl know who you are but in fact you're not to blame
And your speed king in your car you can drive far far away
You got no chance so good you are to reach the stars of the highway
Somewhere fly the glory knights
Somewhere in the skies
Can't you see
Fire's always good for them remember burn one of the best
When smoke on the water went then they knew the smell of success
And now you can understand these fires burning in my chest
Somewhere fly the glory knights
Somewhere in the skies
Can't you see
It's a legend alive
I was no more than a child some of their songs still stay on my lips
And I've dreamed one of these night god will come back and take the lead
Sweet child in time through the light we win much more then unchained
See god wake up and fight to see the stars of the highway
Somewhere fly the glory knights
Somewhere in the skies
Can't you see
60's are over and 70's so far
No one has dared to take the place of the dead stars
Business and players shall become less and less dark
They knew their job and gonna come to love their wifes
But it can slowly be with new rock'n roll stars
There's no hero no devil
You know that I am just a fool on the scene
You've come you're sixteen and says you'll be mine
But can you understand what I feel inside
I'm still glad to sing but I haven't found a wife
But who loves who in the back stages of the skies
So I don't wanna be your rock'n roll star
Don't let me down down in the lonely nights
All raise are maybe so many lies
I still rise and wonder if the preacher's not right
When the music's over turn off the light
Even if you wanna be a rock'n roll starI was born amidst the purple waterfalls
I was weak yet not unblessed
Dead to the world Alive for the journey
One night I dreamt a white rose withering
a newborn drowning a lifetime loneliness
I dreamt all my future Relived my past
A witnessed the beauty of the beast
Where have all the feelings gone
Why has all the laughter ceased
Why am I loved only when I'm gone
Gone back in time to bless the child
Think of me long enough to make a memory
Come bless the child one more time
How can I ever feel again
Given the chance would I return
I've never felt so alone in my life
As I drank from a cup which was counting my time
There's a poison drop in this cup of Man
To drink it is to follow the left hand path
Where have all the feelings gone
Why is the deadliest sin  to love as I loved you
Now unblessed homesick in time
soon to be freed from care from human pain
My tale is the most bitter truth
Time pays us but with earth  dust and a dark silent grave
Remember my child Without innocence the cross is only iron
hope is only an illusion  Ocean Soul's nothing but a name
The Child bless thee  keep thee forever
It is the end of all hope
To lose the child the faith
To end all the innocence
To be someone like me
This is the birth of all hope
To have what I once had
This life unforgiven
It will end with a birth
No will to wake for this morn
To see another black rose born
Deathbed is slowly covered with snow
Angels they fell first but I'm still here
Alone as they are drawing near
In heaven my masterpiece will finally be sung
Wounded is the deer that leaps highest
And my wound it cuts so deep
Turn off the light and let me pull the plug
Mandylion without a face
Deathwish without a prayer
End of hope
End of love
End of time
The rest is silence
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world
The child gave thought to the poet's world
Gave comfort to the Fallen
Heartfelt lovelorn
Remaining yet still uninvited
Those words scented my soul
Lonely soul Ocean soul
It's not the monsters under your bed
It is the Man next door
That makes you fear makes you cry
Makes you cry for the child
All the wars are fought among those lonely men
Unarmed unscarred
I don't want to die a scarless man
A lonely soul
Tell me now what to do
I studied silence to learn the music
I joined the sinful to regain innocence
Heaven queen cover me
In all that blue
Little boy such precious joy
Is dead to the world
Heaven queen carry me
Away from all pain
All the same take me away
We're dead to the world
Dead silent constant
Yet always changing
 My favorite view of this world
As he died he will return to die in me again
Weaving the cloth giving birth to the Century Child
Who gave his life not for the world but for me
Innocence reborn once more
Ever felt away with me
Just once that all I need
Entwined in finding you one day
Ever felt away without me
My love it lies so deep
Ever dream of me
Would you do it with me
Heal the scars and change the stars
Would you do it for me
Turn loose the heaven within
I'd take you away
Castaway on a lonely day
Bosom for a teary cheek
My song can but borrow your grace
Come out come out wherever you are
So lost in your sea
Give in give in for my touch
For my taste for my lust
Your beauty cascaded on me
In this white night fantasy
All I ever craved were the two dreams I shared with you
One I now have will the other one ever dream remain
For yours I truly wish to be
I'm a priest for the poorest sacrifice
I'm but a raft in a sea of sorrow and greed
You bathed in my wine
Drank from my cup mocked my rhyme
Your slit tongues licked my aching wounds
Put a stake through my heart
And drag me into sunlight
So awake for your greed
As you're slaying the dreamer
Swansong for the Wish of Night
God it hurts give a name to the pain
Our primrose path to hell is growing weed
Blame me it's me
Coward a goodfornothing scapegoat
Dumb kid living a dream
Romantic only on paper
Tell me why you took all that was mine
Stay as you lay  don't lead me astray
Wake up mow the weed
You'd be nothing without me
Take my life if you have the heart to die
You bastards tainted my tool
Raped my words played me a fool
Gather your precious glitter and leave me be
The Great Ones are all dead
And I'm tired too
I truly hate you all
Fare thee well little broken heart
Downcast eyes lifetime loneliness
Whatever walks in my heart will walk alone
Constant longing for the perfect soul
Unwashed scenery forever gone
No love left in me
No eyes to see the heaven beside me
My time is yet to come
So I'll be forever yours
One more night
To bear this nightmare
What more do I have to say
Crying for me was never worth a tear
My lonely soul is only filled with fear
Long hours of loneliness
Between me and the sea
Losing emotion
Finding devotion
Should I dress in white and search the sea
As I always wished to be  one with the waves
Ocean Soul
Walking the tideline
I hear your name
Is angels wispering
Something so beautiful it hurts
I only wished to become something beautiful
Through my music through my silent devotion
You were my first love
The earth moving under me
Bedroom scent beauty ardent
Distant shiver heaven sent
I'm the snow on your lips
The freezing taste the silvery sip
I'm the breath on your hair
The endless nightmare devil's lair
Only so many times
I can say I long for you
The lily among the thorns
The prey among the wolves
Someday I will feed a snake
Drink her venom stay awake
With time all pain will fade
Through your memory I will wade
Barely cold in her grave
Barely warm in my bed
Settling for a draw tonight
Puppet girl your strings are mine
This one is for you for you
Only for you
Just give in to it never think again
I feel for you
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
My/your spirit and your/my voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your/my mind
He's there the Phantom of the opera
Beware the Phantom of the opera
In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery
Were both in you
And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your/my mind
Sing my angel of music
Trees have dropped their leaves
Clouds their waters
All this burden is killing me
Distance is covering your way
Tears your memory
All this beauty is killing me
Oh do you care
I still feel for you
So aware
What should be lost is there
I fear I will never find anyone
I know my greatest pain is yet to come
Will we find each other in the dark
My long lost love
Safely away from the world
In a dream timeless domain
A child dreamy eyed
Mother's mirror father's pride
I wish I could come back to you
Once again feel the rain
Falling inside me
Cleaning all that I've become
My home is far but the rest it lies so close
With my long lost love under the black rose
You told I had the eyes of a wolf
Search them and find the beauty of the beast
All of my songs can only be composed of the greatest of pains
Every single verse can only be born of the greatest of wishes
I wish I had one more night to live
A saint blessed me drank me deeply
Spitting out the misery in me
Still a sinner rapes a 1000 saints
Sharing the same hell with me
Sanest choice in this insane world
Beware the beast but enjoy the feast he offers
Oh sweet Christabel Share with me your poem
For I know now I'm a puppet on this silent stage show
I'm but a poet who failed his best play
A Dead Boy who failed to write an ending
To each of his poems
Awake
Slaves of gods
Revive
Fear not thy glory
Take it for thyself
And rest none on fallacy
Stand atop thy stolen dominion
Forever
Thy era hath come
Behold the crystals of the new day
They are nothing but concrete
They were set by men
And so eventually shall wither and crumble
With power inevitably comes conflict
With conflict comes the onslaught of the powers that be
To contradict is to step out of line
To do so is to defy the restraint of morality and correctness
What are you waiting for
Aren't we all set for death
Aren't we all followers
Most people don't even fucking realise
What it is they are following
Isn't it time to begin again
The crystals of the new day are nought but concrete
The prayers once held in the hearts of free men
Are now fragments of something
That we can no longer afford to believe in
Awake
Slaves of gods
Revive
Fear not thy glory
Take it for thyself
And rest none on fallacy
But then
The hidden warmth of mercy shone through
The smog we generated and sent above
Cleared at least for a moment
I was sure then
Humility would show us what was wrong
In that brief glimpse of beauty
We could have saved ourselves
We might just have lived
But still
We should not give in to death
There is still a chance
To take back what is not ours
From the hands of those who would suck it dry
This may not yet be a graveyard earth
We could yet survive
There is still a chance
To give back what is not ours
They will suck it dry
Dumbfounded
We staggered across oceans to new worlds
Came saw ultimately conquered all
But what can we as simple mortals do with it
Meandering aimlessly through a labyrinth of existence
We are all fools
Hell
Most people will simply never learn
Whether it's through stubbornness or stupidity
Most people are simply doomed
But it's not for want of trying
Regardless
For most people the future simply will not arrive
And it's futile to hope otherwise
In spite of our trying
Those that emerge from the curtainedoff mirror
Wiping fluid and blood from their hands
Return to their pews and bow their heads
Most people will simply never learn
Whether it's through stubbornness or stupidity
Everyone is doomed
Once upon a time in a medieval legendary world
In late December cold of the thousand winter season
Blackheim took farewell of his crypts in the forestrealms
And rode into the horizonland unreachable for mortals
The mighty skies turned into a colour of blackest midnight
Still the winds knew where to travel on a forthblown path
He passed the chasm so below and the home of Aurora Borealis
He would soon be facing the lurkers of time  life  death
Blackheim's quest to bring back the stolen autumn
He exchanged his sentinel soul for a serpent sleeping in his heart
And so September appeared on wings and was brought back to his land
He exchanged his sentinel blood for dragon's breath raging in his lungs
And so October appeared on wings and was brought back to his land
He exchanged his sentinel wisdom for ashes buried in his eyes
And so November appeared on wings and was brought back to his land
Blackheim finally asked for December since the sentinels of life and death did not know it was the month of winter
The lurker of time cried out Blackheim's fooling stratagem
But the sentinel was at one with lightning
And threw the serpent into the mouth of time
Blew the dragon's breath with the strength of a demon
Into the eyes of life the lurker
Spread the ashes in the shadows of death
And the curse dissolved with their departure
Deathlike was the century in this horizonland oh so far away
Cold and blackened with no sounds of rejoice
Now he held the triumph high in heart
Stormed over fields with might in hand
So here we are
At the breach between this world and the next
Stare down into that blacklustre cathedral once again my friends
Gather in it's all encompassing fury
One last time
Who is to define the difference
We know none of us the feeling of death
We shall not know until the ultimate
When shadows arrive for us
Could it be
That our end is indeed here
Or shall we be reborn
It's as they say my friends
This is not the end
This is not the beginning
But it is an end
As it is a beginning
One unto the other
In life and in death
Until there is nothing left
We cannot say that is to say put our finger on such a thing
That none of us have heard felt or seen
Therefore I am sadly forced to presume
That these are one and the same
Death is life
One unto the other
Forever it shall be
We know not what death is
None of us have felt it
Death is life
One unto the other
Forever it shall be
Until there is nothing left
Science teaches us nothing
Religion simply blurs our view
Our simple minds cannot possibly fathom anything conclusive
The shit we create can do us nothing but harm in the long run
I see wars famine disease sheer fucking hatred
Humanity cleaved apart countless times
All one against the other
Yet still
We persist
Into the new era
It comes for us all
Grieve my friends  it comes for us all
I am just a copy of a copy of a copy
Everything I say has come before
Assembled into something into something into something
I am never certain anymore
I am just a shadow of a shadow of a shadow
Always trying to catch up with my self
I am just an echo of an echo of an echo
Listening to someone's cry for help
Look what you had to start
Why all the change of heart
Well you need to play your part
A copy of a copy of a
Look what you gone and done
Well that doesn't sound like fun
So I'm not the only one
A copy of a copy of
I am little pieces
Pieces that were picked up on the way
Invented with a purpose
A purpose that's become quite clear today
Look what you had to start
Why all the change of heart
Well you need to play your part
A copy of a copy of a
Look what you gone and done
Well that doesn't sound like fun
So I'm not the only one
Yeah copy of a copy of a
I am just a finger on a trigger on a finger
Doing everything I'm told to do
Always my intention my intention your intention
Just doing everything you tell me to
Look what you had to start
Why all the change of heart
Well you need to play your part
A copy of a copy of a
Now look what you gone and done
Well that doesn't sound like fun
See I'm not the only one
A copy of a copy of a  
Look what you had to start Look what you had to start
Why all the change of heart Why all the change of heart
Yeah you need to play your part you need to play your part
A copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a
Now look what you gone and done look what you gone and done
Well that doesn't sound like fun that doesn't sound like fun
Yeah I'm not the only one I'm not the only one
A copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a
Hahahaunted
The throat is deep and the mouth is wide
Saw some things on the other side
Made me promise to never tell
But you know me I can't help myself
Now I've got something you have to see
They put something inside of me
The smile is red and its eyes are black
I don't think I'll be coming back
I don't believe it
I had to see it
I came back haunted
I came back haunted
I said goodbye but I
I had to try
I came back haunted
Ccccame back haunted
Everywhere now reminding me
I am not who I used to be
I'm afraid this has just begun
Consequences for what I've done yeah
I don't believe it
I had to see it
I came back I came back haunted
Ccccame back haunted
I said goodbye but I
I had to try
I came back I came back haunted
I ccccame back haunted
I don't believe it
I had to see it
I came back I came back haunted
Ccccame back haunted
I said goodbye but I

Ccccame back haunted
They tried to tell me but I
I couldn't stop myself and I
I came back I came back haunted
Ccccame back haunted
Just can't
Stop
Came back hahahaunted
Just can't
Stop
Now my path has gone astray
I'm just tryin' to find my way
Wandered here from far away
I'm just tryin' to find my way
You were never meant to see
All those things inside of me
Now that you've gone away
I'm just tryin' to find my way
Uh uh uh ohhh
Uh uh uh ohhh
Uh uh uh ohhh Ooooooooh
Uh uh uh ohhh
I have made a great mistake
Pray The Lord my soul to take
Ghosts of who we used to be
I can feel them come for me
It looks as thought they're here to stay
I'm just tryin' to find my way
Uh uh uh ohhh
Uh uh uh ohhh Ooooooooh
Uh uh uh ohhh
Uh uh uh ohhh
I have been to everyplace
I have been to everywhere
I'm just tryin' to find my way
All I got so far
Go
I've heard all I need to know
Your voice in fucking echo stereo
This particular scenario
Looks like another all time low
Why did you go and let them in
See this is where the fun begins
You barely even pierced the skin
Just wait 'til you see what has come in
Get down on the floor
Shut the god damn door
We'll do this all before
They're coming back for more
So give me just a little baby
Just something to get by
It's gonna last forever baby
We'll get the other side
And we will live forever baby
And stretch across the sky
I'll follow right behind you baby
We're never gonna die
Hey
Everything is not okay
We lost too much along the way
The passengers are out today
It looks as though they're here to stay
This paranoia turns to fear
This too is whispering in your ear
Pretending but I know you hear
That's how we fucking end up here
So give me just a little baby
Just something to get by
It's gonna last forever baby
We'll get the other side
And we will live forever baby
And stretch across the sky
I'll follow right behind you baby
We're never gonna die
We're never gonna die
How did we get so high
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
If I were you I wouldn't trust
A single word I say
Think by now you should know
That nothing's gonna change
Can I ask you something what did you expect
So disappointed with what you get
Do you ever want to just get outta here
So disappointed just disappear
Look at you Superman
With all the world to change
Think by now you'd figure out
That nothing's gonna change
And I am part of the reason
Can I ask you something what did you expect
So disappointed with what you get
Do you ever want to just get outta here
So disappointed just disappear
I survived everything
I have tried everything
Everything everything
And anything
All the walls begin to dissolve away
Do your hands begin to shake shake shake shake shake
And just do what you think you used to be
All begins to bend then break break break break
Wave goodbye
Wish me well
I've become
Something else
Something else something else
It's just the world
But this thing that lives inside of me
The sound that rocks awake awake awake awake break
And if he depletes what's owed to me
And he comes to grab and take and take and take
I am whole
I believe
I am whole
I am free
I am whole
I can see
Always here
Finally
I am whole
I believe
I am whole
I am free
Do your trails like fingernails
Scratch across the sky
Hard to know figure out
Tell the truth from lies
Everywhere listening
Ever word you say
Think I found a way around
Ya think I found a way
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on
Satellite I'm watching you
I'm one step ahead
Satellite I'm part of you
I'm inside your head
Yes we can yes we did
Eliminate despair
Better watch what you think
What was that you said
Everywhere and everything
And every word you say
Think I found a way out
Think I found a way
Come on
Satellite I'm watching you
I'm one step ahead
Satellite I'm part of you
I'm inside your head
Satellite I'm watching you
I'm one step ahead
Satellite I'm part of you
I'm inside your head
Satellite
Satellite I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite so very high
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite so very high
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite so very high
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite so very high
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite so very high
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite so very high
I know you're up there somewhere
So very high
So very high
Hallucinate in high fidelity
The pieces of a plan
Extraction of the highest quality
Blood from my own hand
A line of lyric looping through my head
Nobody listening
It doesn't really matter anymore
Yes it doesn't mean a thing
I've gotta let go
I've gotta get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away
An eye for chasing wonders to behold
Statements so profound
A place to bury everything I did
And burn it to the ground
A fire illuminates the final scene
The past repeats itself
I cannot tell the difference anymore
I cannot trust myself
I've gotta let go
I've gotta get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away
I've gotta let go
I've gotta get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away
I think
I could
Lose myself in here
I think
I could
Lose myself in here
I think
I could
Lose myself in here
I think
I could
Lose myself in here
I've gotta let go
I've gotta get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away
Got to let him go
Find another way
Why'd you have to make it so hard
Let me get away
I followed you again this morning
Just close enough to feel you near
Pretending everyone could see me
Just slip away and dissapear
They're right behind
There's someone behind you
They're all behind you
They're on the run
As good as blind
I'm out of time
Somewhere to find
So well defined
They're all aligned
They're intertwined
You're undermined
There's someone behind
They recognize
So hard to find
As good as blind
I'm out of time
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I had a friend I think you knew me
I couldn't seem to make you see
I know they're watching me and falling
I know I'll never get away
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out
What a pathetic string of words
Just leave them lying on the floor
The warning posted on the door
Not over here not anymore
There was a place that could have been
Step over all it used to be
Since you have let yourself come in
Somethings I'd rather you not see
See I keep lying to myself
Don't know what else there is to do
If I could be somebody else
Well I think I would for you
Didn't It seemed like something more
So long I can't remember when
All this has happened all before
And this will happen all again
And I only have myself to blame
And I only have myself to blame
See I keep lying to myself
Don't know what else there is to do
If I could be somebody else
Well I think I would for you
See I keep lying to myself
Don't know what else there is to do
If I could be somebody else
Well I think I would for you
Split
Split into
Something else
Shed
Precious skin
Save yourself
We
Have to purge
What you were
Yes
Yes of course
It's gonna hurt
Nature is violent
The very nature of this is violent
No no no no no no that was someone else
No no no no no no no that wasn't me
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
I can't believe they can ever remember which one you are
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
Slide
Just become
Your disease
Leave
Them behind
You are free
Take
What you want
You deserve
Yes
Yes of course
This is gonna hurt
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
I can't believe they can ever remember which one you are
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
I just don't know anymore 
I just don't know
Only thing I've ever done
/Ticking time is running out/
Closest I've ever come
/Ticking time is running out/
Oh so tired on my own
/Ticking time is running out/
Best days I've ever known
/Ticking time is running out/
Yesterday I found out the world was ending
Yesterday I found out the world was ending
A little more
every day
falls apart and
slips away
I don't mind
I'm okay
wish it didn't
have to end this way
These four walls are closing in
/Ticking time is running out/
Of all the things that might have been
/Ticking time is running out/ yeah
Watch young lovers walking by
/Ticking time is running out/ yeah
God forgive me if I cry
/Ticking time is running out/
A little more
every day
falls apart and
slips away
I don't mind
I'm okay
nothing ever
stays the same
While we can
remember when
always running
even then
Stay with me
hold me near
And I'm still here
step right up march push
crawl right up on your knees
please greed feed no time to hesitate
I want a little bit I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I want to watch it come down
don't like the look of it
don't like the taste of it
don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down
all the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
take the skin and peel it back
now doesn't that make you feel better
shove it up inside surprise lies
stains like the blood on your teeth
bite chew suck away the tender parts
I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
maybe afraid of it let's discredit it let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down
now doesn't that make you feel better
the pigs have won tonight
now they can all sleep soundly
and everything is all right
step right up march push
crawl right up on your knees
please greed feed no time to hesitate
I want a little bit
I want a piece of it
I think he's losing it
I want to watch it come down
don't like the look of it
don't like the taste of it
don't like the smell of it
I want to watch it come down
all the pigs are all lined up
I give you all that you want
take the skin and peel it back
now doesn't that make you feel better
shove it up inside surprise lies
stains like the blood on your teeth
bite chew suck away the tender parts
I want to break it up
I want to smash it up
I want to fuck it up
I want to watch it come down
maybe afraid of it let's discredit
it let's pick away at it
I want to watch it come down
now doesn't that make you feel better
don't you feel a whole lot better
and all the pigs are all lined upI won't give up
Hope is not lost
I see so much room for improvement
When talking about my own game
Always working harder always reaching higher
Always a step ahead
But then there are those
Drowning in their own hype
Nothing to believe in
Rotting in the spotlight
Soon we'll be able
To cut them out of our lives
A long and awaited goodbye
Thanks for the dirt on our faces
Thanks for living a lie
Thanks for the constant reminder of why we fight
This is why we fight
This is why we fight
To keep this music that we love from scum like you
To show the world what working hard can do
The passions gone
Apathy has killed it
And we curse the ones
Who take it for granted
Soon we'll be able
To cut them out of our lives
A long and awaited goodbye
Thanks for the dirt on our faces
Thanks for living a lie
Thanks for the constant reminder of why we fight
We fight to free our own minds
Provoking thoughts cause change in time
Protect her with your live
She's mother to us all
Fight despite all odds
We won't fall
I won't give up
Hope is not lost
Hope is not lost
Is this dragging you down
Because it's tearing me apart
I'm trying so hard to stay positive
But this one's too close to my heart
I'm taking this personally
Because lately no one seems to see that we're losing
The very thing that gave life meaning
And gave us all a place to go
I remember a time when this place was more than a building
Felt so afraid felt so alive oh how I miss the feeling
Although I know those days are gone
I'm not ashamed of where I came from
Doors are closed and the lights are out
We've run this place to the ground
Watched the fire as it burned out
With the best of intent
Leaving me here on my own
With nothing to call home
You claim to love something you helped destroy
And I just want to know why
We're making plans to build it up again
Don't get in our way
I remember a time when this place was more than a building
Felt so afraid felt so alive oh how I miss the feeling
Although I know those days are gone
I'm not ashamed of where I came from
Doors are closed and the lights are out
We've run this place to the ground
Watched the fire as it burned out
With the best of intent
Leaving me here on my own
With nothing to call home
We've run this place to the ground
With the best of intent
With nothing to call home
We won't be forgotten
Our spirit lives on
We won't forget
We won't forget
We won't forget
That you're spirit lives on
Doors are closed and the lights are out
We've run this place to the ground
Watched the fire as it burned out
With the best of intent
Leaving me here on my own
With nothing to call home
We've run this place to the ground
With the best of intent
With nothing to call home
I can't believe 
What started out as a dream
Is now finally in reach
But it isn't my goals in front of me
I'm staring into a ghost
But what's hurting the most
Is how far you strayed 
From what you said you'd be
You say it's me who betrayed you
The blind leading the blind
To still be lost in what you'll never find
Just cause you gave up 
Won't mean I will too
I won't let this go
When you're the one responsible
And I didn't lose my sight
But eyes burn when they see the truth but refuse to turn
Away from everything you left
Burn like all the victims in your wreck
I feel so cheated
So much time wasted on all the things you could have been
Despite how things played out
I thought you should know
I won't let this go
When you're the one responsible
And I didn't lose my sight
But eyes burn when they see the truth but refuse to turn
I won't stand for this again
I'm becoming who I'm supposed to be
This is me
Cutting the ties
This is me
Saying goodbye
Saying goodbye
I won't let this go Let this go
When you're the one responsible
And I didn't lose my sight I won't let this go
But eyes burn when they see the truth but refuse to turn
I won't let this go
I won't let this go
Let this go
I won't let this go
I won't let this go
Let this go
We've had enough
To finally see take the blinders off
We'll make a stand
Tear this city down with our bare hands
They won't know what hit them
As they brush the dirt and get back to their feet
We'll hit them hard again
Time It's time to clean this mess
To to clench your fists
Stand and bring them to justice
Time It's time to make things right
To To be a light
Stand in an empire of darkness
We have the numbers I like our chances
We have the numbers I'm liking our chances
We have the numbers I like our chances
We have the numbers I'm liking our chances
Fight back don't be afraid
They may own you but you are not a slave
Step back and look around
You've got what it takes to tear this whole thing down
They won't know what hit them
As they brush the dirt and get back to their feet
We'll hit them hard again
Time It's time to clean this mess
To To clench your fists
Stand And bring them to justice
Time It's time to make things right
To To be a light
Stand In an empire of darkness
We Shine
Be a light
In an empire of darkness
Light the way for others to see beyond this
We shine
It's time to clean this mess
To clench your fists
And bring them to justice
Time It's time to make things right
To To be a light
Stand In an empire of darkness
We're lighting the way
Don't fall behind
Stay close or you'll be
Left in the dark
Let it be known
Your reputation precedes you
You proved everyone right
Let's see you talk your way out of this one
Or beg for your life
Heavy lies the crown that never quite fit your head
Sinking in your thrown
Just waiting for death
The sun will burn a hole right through your blackened skies
A light will shine exposing all your flaws unto the world
Will turn and everyone who bows to you will stand
And scream for your head unworthy king
You're a disgrace to everyone who came before you
There's a hope left in the kingdom
For a renewed sense of freedom
And even though spirits are broken
We're reaching to the skies and we're tearing them open
We'll move on without you
Rebuild without you
We've known all about you All along
You've been exposed
Now you're the ruler of nothing
Just a man without a country
No mercy was shown now that you've been dethroned
The sun will burn a hole right through your blackened skies
A light will shine exposing all your flaws unto the world
Will turn and everyone who bows to you will stand
And scream for your head unworthy king
We'll move on without you
We'll rebuild rebuild without you
You've been dethroned
You've been dethroned
Is this the end Or just the beginning
This is the end
This is the birth this is the death
This is the first time we looked at ourselves
And didn't feel like screaming
This is the new this is the past
This is the last time we doubt ourselves
And accept what we're becoming
Heroes don't wait to act
Or run when blue skies turn black
Don't wait for them to pull you through
Maybe they've all been waiting for you
So take a stand
Fall or rise to the occasion
It's your decision to make
God only knows how long we've been waiting
For someone like you
The person you are
Is a direct result of your actions
All paths in life lead to one road
I see a light inside you
Suppressed by a fear of failure
How long 'til it breaks free
How long until you can save me
So what is it you're waiting for
The bigger they are
The harder they fall
You have the strength to take them on
The battles been lost
But we'll win the war
Now that you found something to fight for
So take a stand
Fall or rise to the occasion
It's your decision to make
God only knows how long we've been waiting
For someone like you
The person you are is a direct result of your actions
All paths in life lead to one road
The sun rises and sets without me
I hope I never leave your thoughts
Do you still hold on to my picture
Does life go on without me there
You love a ghost you love a man you cannot see
You sleep alone and when you wake hope it was just a dream
Thank you so much for your faith in me
This is how I wanted to go out
I wouldn't change it if I could
My only regret is leaving you
True love never dies
So this isn't goodbye
Because you let me live my own life
Despite how much it hurts you to see me go
And to what me fall
You stood by me through it all
This is not the end
I'll see you again
Postcards from graveyards
Messages from beyond
Informing our loved ones
Of just how far we've come
And after handful and handful of soil
We barely scratch the surface
But your faith is a constant reminder
This grave holds a purpose 
This place is a graveyard
This place is a graveyard
We'll find our way
True love never dies
So this isn't goodbye
Because you let me live my own life
Despite how much it hurts you to see me go
And to what me fall
You stood by me through it all
This is not the end
I'll see you again
These graves hold life
We're gonna dig tonight
These graves hold life
This is not goodbye
We'll hold it together
Because our faith is strong 
And they'll speak our names
Long after we're gone
True love never dies
So this isn't goodbye
Because you let me live my own life
Despite how much it hurts you to see me go
And to what me fall
You stood by me through it all
This is not the end
I'll see you again
Oh I promise I will try my best
To finally get this all off my chest
But don't get me wrong
Or mistake this for complaining
I'm keeping my head up even though times are changing
You lit a fire
Inside of me
And now I'm moving on
Because you've woken something up inside of me
Gave me fire gave me strength
Gave me what I needed to make it on my own
Gave me more than you could ever know
Now I'm awake
Feeling something that I haven't felt in a long time
And I won't forget what you have done for me
You gave me inspiration a guiding light to pull me through
This is your recognition
And I owe it all to you
A fire burns
Inside of me
And now I'm moving on
Because you've woken something up inside of me
Gave me fire gave me strength
Gave me what I needed to make it on my own
Gave me more than you could ever know
You gave me fire
You gave me strength 
A fire burns inside of me 
I don't fit in
And never will I'm not like them
Now I'm calling you out exposing you as a fraud
So the world can see its true enemy
This unbearable silence breeds unspeakable violence
When those left standing are like me
Those who defy
Will lose their life
What good is your life
If saved by a lie
Those who believe
Never die
Give me the strength to fight
Cause I'm barely holding on
Give me the sight to see beyond them
And I can't trust my eyes
Cause they've failed me once before
Fueled by what's inside
I'm tearing down your empire
Bow down
Or dance in the fire
Bow down
Or dance in the fire
If death is all you have to scare me
Then you're powerless to stop me
If everything I've done only frees one mind
Then this all wasn't a waste of time
Those who are free
Never die
Give me the strength to fight
Cause I'm barely holding on
Give me the sight to see beyond them
And I can't trust my eyes
Cause they've failed me once before
Fueled by what's inside
I'm tearing down your empire
Down I'm bringing you down
Down
We're bringing you down
If death is all you have to scare me
Then you're powerless to stop me
If everything I've done only frees one mind
Then this all wasn't a waste of time
Have you noticed the change
Well so have I
We pay admission just to wait outside
I miss the way things used to be
The excitement is gone
I'm tired of preaching to myself
While everyone looks the other way
Your complaints fall on deaf ears
I'm losing everything I tried to save
This marks the death of an era
The start of a movement
A new breed of people
Who refuse to stay silent
If you're not here to help
Stay out of the way
Crashing through the fences
Change comes today
No respect for real talent
When gimmicks take the stage
Musicians thrown to the wayside
When thoughtless phrases pave the way
So sing along to every word
But it's a joke we've all heard
They force feed you this mindless act
And hope in time you'll sing it back
I'm tired of preaching to myself
While everyone looks the other way
Your complaints fall on deaf ears
I'm losing everything I tried to save
This marks the death of an era
The start of a movement
A new breed of people
Who refuse to stay silent
If you're not here to help
Stay out of the way
Crashing through the fences
Change comes today
I never thought this day would come
Now everything's in pieces
How did we let this happen
After all these years
Change comes todayI am the vengeance a link between the worlds
Souring in legions controller of all
I am the substance of the chaos
There's one dominion an evil and divine
Spawn the inferno oblivion calls
Don't look for sanctuary coming
The end is calling
Deceive and destroy
Afterlife  revelations unveil
A blackness remains the end of the line
Ashes of man eye of the one divine
The blackness ascends powers untold
The Afterlife
The heart of chaos will manifest again
The seed of the serpent the dagger of doom
So even death can die in deadland
The phantom's aeon
Dream is denied
Afterlife  revelations revive
Ride hell's in fury an evil in believe
Wrath upon the dead and dreaming
Lie sins subliminal I twist in harmony
Blood upon my darkest day
Slit my wrist and watch me bleed
Tighten the noose around my neck
Fear the evil turn the lights
Wake up dead
I'm falling
I can hear it whisper as I desecrate myself
Wake up dead
It's calling
Wake up dead  alive
Die life's expendable taking my last breath
Waiting for my death I'm grieving
Why in the darkest hours I can hear my call
Hell for now and evermore
The sins will not justify the blood on my hands
I'm twisting the knife
Reality is no more I'm waking up dead and alive
Disengage your fear
and see the devil in the eye
Rearrange the truth
and be a believer to the lie
Is there a way to find
peace of mind in the life you life
Search the inner soul
And you'll find the rainbow's end again
Far away far from here
Cross the river on a shore of another time
Far away far from here
Cross the river on the other side
There it lies far away
Seek to find your remedy
Your life is on the wire
Living on the disbelief
Salvation is the crime
Look the beast in the eye set it free
The animal will be unchained
See deep within and you'll find what you seek
The powers will lie there unbound
The eye of the mind unfolds the unreal
Open the doors that where closed
Broken the seal to a new world within
Stand in the gateway to hell
Walk through the fire let no one stand in your way
The unknown waits in the darkness alone
I am falling fast
I'm right in the final hour
Future turns to past
Been sent to hell and back
Nailed to a cross and I spit in disgust
No way that I'll follow the blind
Broken down the shackles that fettered my mind
The devil laughs by my side
Look in my eyes and see what I've become
Come hell come fire I'm not afraid  perpetual at last
Hear the cry from the underworld
to pull you under
It's the enemy the journey ends here
Light the path throughout the night
it's getting close
Sanctuary in a hollow void
See a sign appear in the dark
Your sould will perish in flames
The Sign of the two turns to one
No savior uo high
The promised euphoria's gone
So hell is life and death
Fell the breath inside your minde
it prevades your soul
Hear the voices cry through the never
Your eyes turn inside out you're all alone now
Feel your heart explode piece by piece
Pain suffering just do it
death is the blessing you seek
Your soul will be free
Life is an endless torture
for the mindless and weak
You're killing yourself
Born into sin
a lust for the evil
Betrayed and deceived
benn giving his number
Serpent of death child of the darkness
A servant to torture a slave to power
Twisting his mind the ways of the wicked
There's no turning back
Ten thousand eyes hiding the glory
Who's the chosen one
Who could have known death ws a blessing
It's the Devil's Child
The power he holds witness the progress
His senses unfold the choice has been made
Eyes lit with fire a snake in disguise
Collector of souls the work must go on
Initiate gentice distortion sequence
Commence involuntary human breakdown
Watch the reconstruction
Beginning of the end
THe world is black and burning  Man has failed
Watch the second coming
A season of decay
World elimination  Activate
Another poor example
Can we survive
Create the perfect sample of man
Evaluate  Eliminate
Eliminate the world
Genetic evolution
Composite of a man
Obliterate the defects  Mass produced
Commencing the distortion
Decoding what remains
Redemption and illusion  Enervate
Trapped in a world where nothing is real
Lost in the fires of hell
Possessed I obey in shadows I kneel
A sacrament venom released
I hear'em calling gripping for my soul
Schizophrenia the eyes of the death unfold
Tormented mind soul of black
Lock up in chains forever
Petrified heart eases the pain
I'll be my sacrifice
Shattering world I will not betray
Rigid I await my command
The whisper is near it's leading the way
Death  the final demand
Turned around for another side of life
A dynasty falls another reborn
The Pharaoh's legacy carved into stone
IN scriptures of Re the God of the Nile
Tell how to bury the chosen
Open the temple
Entomb the soul of the king
As the gate opened up
and we saw the temple inside
Heard the calling from beyond
in the temple of the dead
The new king is born gets the white crown
Reigning in slavery cult of the damned
The people rebel dethroning the King
Comes withour warning a shadow
Break the seal
Awake the soul Re
A prophecy
Then the dead arise the dead shall arise
See them as they come from blackened sun
Riding'cross the sky
Fear you'll be the one hunted on the run
A refugee in mind
Dream that this blessing
Will lead you into the light
Blessed by the devil's kiss
Revealing the entrance to hell of night
Hell of night
Stare into the dark don't look upon the face
Hiding in the night
Degenerated soul fear it's your disgrace
Lost inside yourself
In the fire
Where the fallen await
Blinded to all of its glory
See the fear in the eyes of the dead
The circle's to close once again
Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray
Hell calls
A cry from the new world
The dream lasts forever
Man falls
Into the unknown
The new generation
Hear the silence the process of death
The mind is an opening grave
No denial the blood turns to black
No giving in to repent
Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray
Mind torture flames burst
Cast into the fire
Act of death stop breathing
Machines will take control
Close you eyes for a dying world
Death's command won't betray
Bright colors bring empty eyes
Solitude the finest place
Trapped in the civil war of brain waves 
Rotted out from disapoitment 
Repelling from hatred
Impulses grow
Regret tears into the soul like razors
Undersized caskets bring forth repulsion
Charred and buried into the fruitful soil
Innocence locks the eyes preparing for eternal disapoitment 
Emotionless pits walk the street
Marrow of hearts break in heats
Staggered limbless divergence from slumber
Corruption overpowering clean hands
Follow the dark paths without thought
Winds blow the putrid stenches
Screaming in anxiety 
Silence is easier to search than find
Desire for release never found
Undersized caskets bring forth repulsion
Charred and buried into the fruitful soil
Innocence locks the eyes preparing for eternal disapoitment 
Emotionless pits walk the streetAbundant or broke
The elect and the mute
All will slip away the billions
Like thieves through windows
It leaves their branches white
All breathe be breathless
To quit this mortal frame We're not safe
Even lovers are asleep
Both deceived and deceiver are His
This is victory from all these years
Bowing in front of queens
Have gun will travel
SafeCarry your flags march into that fictional cause
And show off that medal
Just don't reach for that gun
Reach for that gun
Carry that banner build that heart out of stone
Just don't reach for that gun
You scaled the high horse and I felt the change
I know the difference between you and me
You scaled the high horse and I felt the change
I know the difference between you and me
You and me
You cleaned the outside of your chalice
But it's filled with robbery and self indulgence
Just like the rest of us
You wear that cross like a crown
You wear that cross like a dagger
You wear that cross like a crown
You wear that cross like a dagger
Oh my god take this sword from my mouth
You scaled the high horse and I felt the change
I know the difference between you and me
Come down from that tower
Come down from that tower
Nothing will be the outcome
Nothing is the outcome
It's like you know the words
But you can't hear the music
You've lived a lie for so long
Now you believe it
You're shooting silver bullets
And taking magic pills
I'm asking you do you know a way to delete my conscience
Don't put your ear to the floor to hear the sound of the future
Yours is a history shaped by disaster
We're coming back for you
You better brace yourself
I'm telling you
We're coming back
To collect that killer
Who killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down
You killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down
We make the same mistakes
We always count them
I want to fail you so badly
I'm telling you
We're coming back
To collect that killer
Who killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down
You killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down
What if I have to lose
What if I have to suffer
So what if I have to lose
So what if I have to suffer
You killed me and threw me away
Am I holding you up
Or you holding me down
From the bloodline of vicious serpents
A dreadful heart within a lovely shell
A demon's heart but with the face of God
I guess a liar's heart is still true even if her lips are not
The vomit that flows out from your mouth
Has seeped into your chest
Searching for the strength
To breathe in one last lie from you
But right now the grave seems so much easier
The fear of that devil in me
It comes from you
You're like the smoke in the window
It comes from you
She comes for sorrow
She comes for lies
We came here for blood
Did you Yes or no
No one's getting out because
We came here for blood
Did you Yes or no
No one's getting out because
We came for blood
She's not breathing and I don't care
Because no one's breathing
She's not breathing
Choke that witch out
Suffocate her
Choke her out
Open that door I'll follow you into that space
Where nothing is regretted then forgotten
Where is that grace that carries me out
So strange it's mine it's closed and locked
And if you open that door
It won't be yesterday when
Before the days of collapsing
And I'll stand through all these lines
Just to make it back to you
Can you help me every step of the way
We can bury that battle and bury the cause
There is nothing that I can say
Because I was wrong this time
Everyone knows cause they see the glare in our eyes
Careful now don't drown yourself in sorrow
I was the one that built that cross and weighed you down
And now I'll carry on till it's over and it's over
And if you open that door
It won't be yesterday when
Before the days of collapsing
And I'll stand through all these lines
Just to make it back to you
Can you help me every step of the way
We can bury that battle and bury the cause
There is nothing that I can say
Because I was wrong this time
Yesterday when
Before the days of collapsing
And I'll stand through all these lines
Just to make it back to you
Can you help me every step of the way
We can bury that battle and bury the cause
There is nothing that I can say
Because I was wrong this time
I hope you burn forever
There will be no other way
No more suffering
No more trust will be lost
No more wounded
No more blood will be shed
Just know I mean to harm you
I want to see you choking
And kicking in your own blood
We all have our own person hells
I just hope yours burns brighter
Deception has been your right hand
Confusing the sight of my left
You won't leave the way you came
And now no more blood will be shed
We will burn for this
We will both of us burn
Left alone
Your pale skin is a razor sharp wire
So I place these scales over my eyes
Don't touch me I'm sick
You whisper but I hear only what I choose
Hello my good old friend
Your hand pulls me back from that mire
Will I look back and stare
And wonder if she is way back there
But afterwards my mouth
Will be filled with gravel
And I'm left alone
You know that feeling of fear
And desperation in the pit
Of your stomach making you nauseous
Excitement apprehension
You wish you could lose it all
Hello my good old friend
Your hand pulls me back from that mire
Will I look back and stare
And wonder if she is way back there
But afterwards my mouth
Will be filled with gravel
And I'm left alone
The fear of dealing with this is stronger
Than the fear of just forgetting this
And future I am scared of you
Left alone
Hello my good old friend
Your hand pulls me back from that mire
Will I look back and stare
And wonder if she is way back there
I swear I'll find my way back
To the light now that I'm left alone
Light that fuse back up three steps
And bite down on that bullet
You've been doing this
Way too long and it can't be fixed
Don't worry
So pull up that chair
And suck down that trouble
Misery is the fuel
That keeps this broken down
Lifeless instrument running
I'm sinking in cursory
And I'm sinking headfirst
Clear your dusty throat and taste that stiletto
Can you taste that metal
Don't worry it can't be fixed
Don't worry it can't be fixed
So don't worry
Light that fuse back up three steps
And sink without a trace
I'm sinking in cursory
And I'm sinking headfirst
Hold me down till I stop crying
I don't want to feel this anymore
Hold you down cause you're not trying
I don't want to feel this anymore
Hold me down till I stop crying
I don't want to feel this anymore
Hold you down cause you're not trying
I don't want to kill you anymore
Is this what you were designed for
Did you think you had it coming
Hell follows with you
I'm sinking in cursory
And I'm sinking headfirst
Is this what you were designed for
Did you think you had it coming
Hell follows with you
Dedication is nothing but a word
What have we become
We become the things we do
When does it end
Argument is the enemy
You've said one hundred opposites of left and wrong
So tell me what's right not what's wrong
I don't care anymore
I'm drained from the struggle
Argument is the enemy
I don't care anymore I'm giving this up
You can fight your way through this graveyard
There is no rehab for your power addiction and
I've had all the freedom that I can stand
Tell me what's right
I can't recall that last day of sun
Curtains closed
And sitting with the lights out
An uncertain emptiness surrounds me
I'm numb and my judgments
Have switched to autopilot
Nothing left but echoes
And thoughts of moving on
Don't stay away
Don't stay here
Tell me all your secrets
I promise I'll be listening
And if you ever come back home
I'll be waiting patiently
Tell me nothing sacred
I promise I won't hear a word
And if you ever come back home
I won't act so patiently
Black feathers
And an unannounced call
These things go hand in hand
Like talking to you
And the intake of glass
I hope this knife in my hand
Speaks for itself
Don't stay away
Don't stay here
Tell me all your secrets
I promise I'll be listening
And if you ever come back home
I'll be waiting patiently
Tell me nothing sacred
I promise I won't hear a word
And if you ever come back home
I won't act so patiently
She's not coming back
Tell me all your secrets
I promise I'll be listening
And if you ever come back home
I'll be waiting patiently
Don't stay away
Don't stay here
Tell me all your secrets
I promise I'll be listening
And if you ever come back home
I'll be waiting patiently
Tell me nothing sacred
I promise I won't hear a word
And if you ever come back home
I won't act so patiently
She's not coming back
I built this destruction with my own hands
With my hands I will help pull it down
And like the worker bees silenced by that swarm
I'll make a new home
String me up just leave me here
And I'll find my way back home I swear
These are not the plans I made
This is not the life I wanted
I don't care
Pull it down
With broken bones and vital organs
Far from functional I am ruined
So pull me down
And I'll find my way back home I swear
What you can't pull from me pull from yourself
We know what we have to do
We're not going anywhere
With blood stained glasses
Staring straight at me and just careless
With that lidless gaze I am ruined
I need to be saved
Pick me up
And I'll find my way back home I swear
What you can't pull from me pull from yourselfWaiting to be born again waiting to see the light
Hoping to feel free again trying to sleep the night
Last days are here to stay last times last forever
Time so eternal stands minute's like a day
Wait for to see the day
Day zero
In the end of the way
It hurts so
hurts to know
to feel the flow
dreaming of better times stars in the open skies
sleep the night away
frozen world soon collides with the echoes in my mind
drink the night away
Wait for to see the day
Day zero
In the end of the way
It hurts so
You judge you know better you think that you are something more
I know you're something less
You say you are better you think that you are so much more
I know you're so much shit
Every day it goes further you're loosing everything there's left and that 
ain't much
Anyway it's wrong anyway it's bad anyway so sad that this is where we've 
come
So sad so real
No way to feel
you don't know
you don't know
you don't know shit
My life is hell and im living in a hole of my own
No way outim going insanethere's no way out
This hole is killing my hope of lifeand everything
seems so senslessfuck this lifeits worthless to live
In a hole
I dont want to live to this life anymorei want more
Pain and agonysorrow and grief till i bleed
Touch of death is coming for me and im ready
i'll die in my hole and i just fucking love it
Hellholethat's the place i want to beall alone
Hellholeis my home and im not gonna leave
Hellholeit's only for me
Hellholemy hell's my heaven my everything
In my eyes I despise your twisted life
Something controlling your fucked up mind
Just a thought of you with your twisted little smile
Stings me like a thorn in my spine
You told me sacred lies
Through your twisted little eyes
you're sicksick
You're a twisted little star
You're a sick motherfucker and a fucking cocksucker
Just dwelling in the dark
Thorn in my spine
That's all you are
Thorn in my spine
That's what you are
I can't stand the sight of you
I can't stand what you put me through
You're a twisted little fuck
You're life a lie that you hide
Is it that terrible being you inside
Surrounding endless darkness
Screaming echoing silence
Embraced by shadows
They tear me apart
I'm nothing that's all I am
I dwell in me in the core of my agony
Within myself think I'm lost again
Feels like I'm fading away
Close my eyes a sudden change into a state
Where life is dust and everything flows
Circling above around
Something grabs me pulling me down I'm falling
Falling further down falling down down in black
Falling further down no way out no way back
Somewhere in time
In a far away place
A wonderful country
is falling from grace
They don't know it yet
But theese times will come
When a cleanhearted young man
Will be standing alone 
To fight what is evil
For the dream they once had
Will the ending be happy
Or will it be sad
Still I remember a time many years ago
They lived in a foreign land and dwelled there evermore
The rivers were running fast and birds they sang their songs
Ancient rocks were breething life and lust
The State in our hearts of everlasting peace
With beautiful landscapes in our arms embraced
Together we sing our hymn to this land
The future of thy soul is in our hands
The king was a man we loved the wisest of them all
He also had a son inheritor of the crown
In years that would come he would be the king
But sometimes life plays tricks on you and me
The rivers are running fast and birds they sings their songs
Ancient rocks are breething life and lust
In the royal court there was an evil man telling prophecies
He was the advisor to the naive king who was poisoned with his lies
Ruler of the kingdom was really this man making future plans
Infecting the king with his sweet sounding voice but heart as cold as ice
Evil prophecies Always fooling the king
Evil prophecies Breething chaos and war
Evil prophecies He invents them himself
Evil prophecies To destroy the fine land in our hearts
I am a wizard
I have thousand names call me what you want
The people who think I'm a prophet of peace are calling me Hister
I will now agitate to anarchy into civil war
To destroy the kingdom is my one great will this will be for real
Deep in the chambers where time's standing still
There's mixtures and potions for all of his needs
The prophet is glaring with eyes cold as ice
A horrible laughter escapes from his mouth
Raving in madness when fumes are inhaled
The poison is ready to fulfill his dreams
He walks to the kitchen unseen by all
The kings food is waiting
It's not what it seems
The crystal glassclear poison pours like wine
Soon it will steal the good king's life
Murder 
Soon it will be solved the problems I have
Get rid of the fool king who sits on his ass
The prince he means trouble must take care of that
Maybe I'll frame him for murdering the king
When my lethal poison has taken his life
I'll place some leftovers for someone to find
I'll place it with great care in the young prince's room
When somebody finds it the prince will be doomed
The crystal glassclear poison pours like wine
The crystal glassclear poison poured like wine
Now it has brought the good king's life to an end
My dear father you have left us
For a better place to be
The people's tears are falling
But they still just cannot see
That Hister is so evil
He's destroying our country
It seems to be so hard to understand that you are gone
Will the future bring your wisdom to me
Or will darkness rule the kingdom for all eternity
You will live in my heart
I will still remember even though we're apart
I will feel you're there for me
As I walk the road of life you'll help me fight for what is right
I will honour thy name
Eventhough you didn't wanted
You've left me all alone
Everybody turns against me
They believe that I'm the one
Who poisoned you my father
You know that it's not true
Oh I see it was the prophet
To take the power away from you
Will the future You will live You will live
Thrown into prison  into Crown's inn
I'm sitting here all alone
Already forgotten by people I loved
Surrounded by walls of stone
Goddamn you prophet for putting me here
Anguish and hate strikes my mind
Darkens my senses tearing my soul
The rage is making me blind
I must control my hate
Don't want to be like him now
I must fight before it's too late
Our kingdom is at stake
How / Can I be free from theese dungeons of hate
I want out to face my enemy
Can I be free from theese dungeons of hate
I / want to face the one who killed the king
Now / I have to think how am I to get out
Out of this dreadful place
I've got to be free to clear my name
And / revenge my father's death
I must
How can I
I must
How can I
How can I
Through with my masterplan
Now it's time to act
If I wait it'll be too late to save our beloved state
I have seen my only chance in my wardener
He's a corageous and good man but he has a naive mind
Help me wardener I'm not feeling well help me I beg you please the ache is killing me
Run quick now Soldiers hunting for me now
The time has come to take the power in my hand
To escape and save the land
Screaming loud in unreal pain
I hope they'll hear my cries
The doctor's chamber with aid is just down the narrow hall
Break loose fly away
I'm running for my life
To the suburbs I set my course
There I'll disappear
Run quick now
I must sleep can't go on
I must charge energy
Quiet and peace in a dead end street
I'll sleep here 'til the dawn Run quick now
Run quick now
Soldiers hunting for you now
The time has come to take the power in your hand
So act and understand
My dear sweet prince
I've seen you in my dreams
Your rise and fall I've seen it all
I wonder how you feel
Now you're on the run
your world is torn apart
Can't you see how it's meant to be
Have faith and trust in me
I'll show you all the prophet
have seen since the dawn of time
I'll give you strength to change the future
to justify the crimes
Now the darkness rules our land
But the power's in your hand
Since you're lonely you are week
For the faithful you must seek
Who are you to talk so strange
Who are you to tell me what I want
Who are you to call me leader
Who are you to tell me what to do
I'm the one since dawn of time
I'm the one to tell you how things are
I'm the prophet of all times
I will help you find the way to go
The faithful leader of the good ones is now in town
You must go see him now at once
to justify the crimes
Who is coming in the dark night who is coming in the rain
I'm captain of the loyal forces tell me now your name
I'm your prince that has been false accused of murdering the King
Lay down your weapons listen now
I'm telling you a thing
I'm gathering resistance to fight the evil one
Who's out there in the distance
Before the chance is gone
So come join me now
Let us fight against the evil of the world
Come join me now
Let us fight against what's wrong
You know the right way to go
Why should we believe in you your words might be a lie
Why risk the souls of all my men may I ask you why
I'm here under the blessing of the prophet of all times
So take a look into my face you'll see it in my eyes
I'm gathering
So come
So come
So come
Here we are we stand together fighting for what's right
We're marching on towards the palace soon it is in sight
Does the evil prophet knows that we're coming will he be prepared to die
Has he understand the signs that's written in the sky
The prophet of evil is standing proud and tall until the end of time
The prophet of evil he doesn't know the time is running out for him I curse his soul
What is this an ambush it's a smaller unit enemies
It seems to me we are expected I wonder how he was able to see
As we're marching into the city I see enemy troops on the streets facing me
Hundreds of them thousands of them behind them there I see
The prophet of evil
We still remember how it used to be
In this fair land before he came
To tear apart he is to blame    
We fight we fight the sun shines so bright
We fight for our brothers and for what is right
We fight we fight we can see the light
Defeating the enemy before the night
Our arms are strong we're fighting what's wrong
Respect our opponent we know that he's strong
See you see me and what we will be
Guardians of justice strong proud and free
Our men are fighting brave in front of me
And I don't beleive in what I see
The evil forces seems to kneel for me
The prophet escapes and now I see
Now I understand they're in my command
Get after the wiz someone says in my mind
I follow him into the palace my home
And suddenly I find myself all alone
But then I see up the stairs there he is
I'm grabbing my lightsabre how can I miss
He's facing the wall and got nowhere to go
I look into his eyes I'm making this slow
Now you will pay for what you did you see
To my father to my mother and to me
I stab my sabre thru his heart
But he's laughing and his clothes just falls apart
The prophet of evil is dead and gone defeated by the son of the crown
The prophet of evil he will no longer lead us into misery cursed be his soulLet it bleed cause it shuts the doors the same doors you thought slammed in your face does bleed you've just thrown yourself against what you did hate them for makes you bleed makes you proud warns you when and why to feel sad drags you deep down in your own mud makes you bite the dust just before this rude awakening could be the stepping stone of the rest of your life but this rude awakening will be your gravestone it's the price of your lies  what do you hide behind your locked eyelids you walk away that's not yours cause you're ruled by your own old fears live a life that's not yours but its own the slave of your selfapathy you won't find cause you're ruled by your own old fears living suffering gloving cursing dying frightening life try to hide cut its throat but you can't because it's yours reveals you as cold as you seem reveals you as lost as you are
So what still running in your cage can't keep your ears to those as sad as you live beyond repetition run away or fade away don't you think your world is too small don't you think live before you die what's up in your cryotube
Away from this life back to the swamp trampling the burning ashes of my shattered dreams underfoot may be facing at last with all my certainties which have been burnt on the altar of self confidence there's no pupil in the eye of the stillborn prophet back to the swamp falling back to the swamp since now certainties have to belong to my fears nothing is safe definition's dead as stillborn prophet I could hope but hope doesn't fit the facts
Your soul is ready inseminated their thoughts their love their hate broken muppet you must survive gaze inside no more soul desperation altered in high performance machines devastated like an afterwar field what you lose of yourself try to triumph over this scum thrown in this their reality lab of their will you have to share your world with those snakes please don't stop your own production of venom thrown in this their reality slave of that your cupidity never no more never no more my choices were yours my life was yours but will it change
I am that that unlikeable child definitively unwanted with the round dirty face who before the giant streetlights or under the grand dames also illuminated 
I am that repulsive child that improvises abed out of an old cardboard box and wait certain that you will accompany me imminent terror imminent leprosy imminent terror imminent fleas of offenses and the imminent crime 
I would take that opportunity to steal your wallet
Aiming at your vein needs being someone you can't be becoming something you're not catching your feet in your fears trying to spread your broken wings trying to take off contemplating your failure hanging yourself at dawn cause tomorrow won't ever let you in there's no reward for your lifelong bleeding did you deserve all these years of suffering everything's lost there is no turning back what did you live for hope did finally burn you'll never fit this life what will you die for you just don't want to know pull the pin out of your brain ducking your head is your due as a pain addict you were born happy to quit this life obscene
Could I sink deeper in the swamp stench into which I did dive your helped to my loss just let me help myself no more time to lose whith your stupid advices no more blood to spill seeking an exit walking down a stairway which leads behind me I'm seeking an exit again and again Seeking an exit can't get out of my despair burning my skin until my flesh is black I'm still poisoning myself seeking an exit needing the exit the despair within hope is a false friend trusting is lying in reality there's no light ther's no light bearer
The sky was not burnt people were not grey shadows children did laugh people could live people could die whenever they wish whenever they had to however they wish as dusk had just been born time did flow like water not blood blood meant life not death but this was before the war war the dead feed the living deadly air burns our lungs I think I'm thinking but I 'm not think I think I'm born to die but I'm already dead I'm dead I'm slaughtered I'm murderedI Know you're innocent no more
You'll see in ime that you're not immortal
I see right through you
You cannot live inside yourself
You cannot lie forever
We see right through you
It's everything you know about you say it's true
But still I know abouy your ways so fuck you
But still you've done it everything well I've done it twice
But theres something else that's coming
So hold your breath
Well I know that you're perfect so raise your hands
And we know that you're nothing show us again
But still I can't believe the pain that you caused
And still I know about your ways so fuck you
You hold your head up and deny
You realize that you're not all moral
They see right through you
You'll cheat and lie until you're dead
You cannot live forever
Disease runs through you
Listen carefully
I faked it all
Then and always
Inside and out
We'll forget you
It's not ending
What's it to you
Isolate me
Feel unsure
Tired of waiting
Please let me go
I'll never forget you
Just let me go
My eyes see everything I want them to
I just don't want them to see you
Just the way that you are
It's so cold
Safely tortured
Hiding the scars
No one knows it
Just you and I
Lift your dress up
I said I'd go slow
I'll never stop this
Until I reload
Sometimes there's no control
Shut up till I'm done talking
You seem so insecure
It seems you got it all
You got it all
You got it all
Before this starts
I just want to tell you
That you could fuck us
Love me
So I can relax
So I can aim straight
So I can do right for us
I know you inside
I know you're cold
I know you're saddened by the loss of those
And now you're cold
I'm sorry that you're next so go
Who's next All right
With the fucking bruised knees in the black shirt
Screaming all right
In the bloody back seat of my black hearse
Hanging all right
On a fucking meat hook in my basement
Who's next All right
It's everybody's time to die
My mind does this
I can't stop the rage inside
My hands again
Hate me
So I can relax
So I can kill you
So I can do right for us
No more pretending
We're all alone
I want to hear just why you left us all
We really loved you
But now you're cold
I'm sorry that you're next to go
Who's next All right
With the fucking bruised knees in the black shirt
Screaming all right
In the back seat of my bloody hearse
Hanging all right
On a fucking meat hook in my basement
Who's next All right
It's time for everybody to die
Yeah fuck you'll die you fucking bitch
I can't deny
Forensic lies
or hateful sighs
I'll wait for you I wait for you
I'm glad you know
I cannot take this anymore
You've pushed me to the limits
You sold us this before but I still know
We'll find the right one to fight with us now
And I know that you're set on us you're set on us you're set on us
I can't feel this way today
And I said that I am tired
So go to sleep and close your eyes
I'm sorry 
For all the sin
For all deception
You know it's hard to face you
When I know what you did
You're sorry
Stay far away from you
I'm sick and tired of you too
But there's the way that you move
Dressed up in lies
Beds in truth
You tried everything you said
But I see that you can't be
What you were before
I'm laughing
Please understand these words
You are nothing anymore
And your skin it hides your waste your age
You're lifeless
Stay far away from you
I'm sick and tired of you too
Theres only one way to hide it
Just paint your eyes it bides the time
But there's the way that you move
Dressed up in lies
Beds in truth
What if I find my way to it
Confinement of my mind
Encased in lies
Why are they doing this 
They said when you got here the whole thing started 
Who are you what are you 
Where did you come from 
I think you're the cause of all this 
I think you're evil 
Evil
Again you fucking did it again
Stay far away from you
I'm sick and tired of you too
What if I find my way to it
Confinement of mind
Encased in lies lies lies
You know
You say that you'd be satisfied
But it's all right
The pills
It's all you have with all the pain
To satisfy
Alone
I feel just as numb don't you know
But it's all right
It's soft
The heat and the smoke take you in
It satisfies
No it's so cold now
Please in the sky
Let it fall
Let if all to me
In these words
In these eyes
Let it all be freed
It's clean
The skin and the dreams help me bleed
But it's all right
The screen has sucked all I am
I'm a shell
It satisfies
My ink
Shows I can't learn a thing
And it's all right
I know
That this wasn't much just a fling
It satisfied
No it's so cold now
So I can't be the one that peels away
But it's heavy and I feel it
So wait I knew it
But I'm guilty though
And I can see them tearing away
Your flesh no
Killed in the rain that day
Just like everyday
Won't you wait for me
It's not over
Go back again
You policed again
Killed it all
Can't wait for violence
If you're open handed
You'll see still lie in my face
I can't wait for violence
You know you say that you'd be satisfied
But it's all right
The pills
It's all you have with all the pain
To satisfy
Alone 
I feel just as numb don't you know
But it's all right
It's soft
The heat and the smoke take you in
It satisfies
Yeah
I realize time's ticking by
Change what I am
This way I feel it
Like me now like you now like me now
The faces change
Hides in the shade
I can't fear the way back into you
Hide everything that's helping me
Why can't you just let me fall apart
The colors fade
Casued bloody days
Now you know the truth about your friends
Just where they are
And where they lie
Why can't I was the blood off my hands
So you think I'm nothing
But you'll see
Dead like me
I got this feeling in my chest
That I'm free
Dead like me
You'll see
I showed you inside of my dream
You'll see
I showed you inside of my dream
You'll see
But it's my turn
You saw me dying
You want to sell you soul to those men
You will risk us all
If there is one thing I've got to tell you
You say you're cold
But it's bullshit
Alone again
I said we'll beat them all
All the pain it satisfies my dreams and thirst
I never try to help you or your filthy friends
I'll awlays hate you till the end
I got my green eyes
I got my glass high
I got my thunder and it's rolling straight up inside
She's got the real shit
Gave me a facelift
We got this spaceship and we're just a dot in the sky
Into the sun
Return as nothing
I got machine guns
And yes they're lots of fun
We got some bullets and we're mowin' everybody down
I got my blue skin
And eat my dinner in sin
I got my pride now and I'm all shook up inside
My mother said that we're all angels
But I swear I saw the evil
Evil that bleeds from the sky from the sky
So I can't help you now
You saved it for yourself
But you stole everything
So you can see it when you 
Wake up
You know there is no one to worship
So fuck her fuck him fuck you fuck
They'll kill everyone we've got to stop them
 Off into the sun
Return as nothing
We will spread to every continent 
and devour every living thing on this Earth
Do you trust me
Do you trust me
Do you want this pain inside
Where's your head
Are you thirsty
Do you know all the simple things that it 
Takes to change my mind
Instead of lying boldly
That face could be so pretty
But you scarred it all before
Put everything aside
Now I know you've filled my life she said
Is there no weapon to make this end you said
I'm sorry I didn't help to pretend you said
Cause I know nothing in my life is chained forever
Now that you can find a way
Where's the frowning
Where's the crying
Where's the I would bleed for you
You held my hand well
Feed the image
I know it's hard for you to believe
That you could be alone now
The picture seems so close
But I'm so very far away
But not far enough
Now I know you'll ruin my life he said
Is there no weapon to make this end you said
I'm sorry I didn't help to pretend she said
Cause I know nothing in my life is chained forever
Now that you can find a way
Hey you sold yourself again
It never comes back again
Yeah you sold yourself again
Bitch you fucked it up again
Bitch do you trust me
Do you trust me
Do you want this pain inside
Where's your head
Are you thirsty
Do you know all the simple things that it
Takes to change my mind
Instread of lying boldly
That face could be so pretty
But you scarred it all before
I saw it all
A piece in games
It sets in slow descend
Just when I thought I saw everything
You showed me something new
You Thought that I would never understand
But now I know how to
Understand you
To see you
To realize the rot inside
You're evil
But placid
I feel sick cause I did not see 
Nothing at all through all the excess
Destoryed it all and took all the rest
I was misled and nothing less
It's all the same in love with distress
Somehow the starts retain our innocence
Disappointment in how things have gone
But inside the eyes of every living man
Steep stairways leading down to God
Show your face so you'll convince all of us
You invade daydreams
And ruin everything
Forever you'll stay the same
Forced us to go insane
There is no place for you in this
Can you find your way back away from us
Can you adhere and show us strength
You fucked us all done nothing straight
Still we won't crawl and we won't fall
Yeah we gave you something to keep
All this again
Not again
Took the long road but got out
I'll show you something
You fucker
Just raise your chin like this
Fuck scrape out his eyes
Yeah now shave his head and face and ass
Just get him ready
Cause I want to maek this last
It's fucking perfect show the world
Still we won't crawl and we won't fall
There is no place for you in this
Can you find your way back away from us
Can you adhere and show us strength
You fucked us all done nothing straight
Still we won't crawl and we won't fall
I push myself in first
I'm here to wait for all the killing
I think I'm just in time
Geewhiz I'd love to die like that

We all just want to see
To see you get kicked in the face

It's OK we all believed them
Battered and misled
Today I set aside a friend
But still I wait for dead
Before this takes time from me
We can all just see
Beginning
The first time that we're inside
You you told me nothing
So I know you lied
We know it
It's the same but it's OK in your eyes
Now outside these lines
Through your own eyes never lies
Why can't you believe
I want it all back all back
Still you showed your sleeves
I want it all back all back
You know it's coming
I caught you dick in hand
Please don't say nothing you'll box yourself again
It's nice just to be right again
But you sacrificed a friend you're the ony shit I know you knew it
It's all right change your own words
Tell the truth inside me
Never seen
There's some that you've wronged
There's some that you set free
There's some that deny
There's some that fall on their knees
Today I set aside a friend
But still I wait for dead
Before this takes time from me
We can all just see
Beginning
The first time that we're inside
You you told me nothing
So I know you lied
We know it
As if the word was ending
Things seem to spin uncontrolled
They're all paper faces
Some withered not old some legends uproot evil
Some made of silver  gold
But why is brimstone worthless
When we're all so cold
No you showed it all before me
You threw it in my face
But still I can't believe you're not at fault
Circumstance allowed me to seek out my revenge
When I find you I'll feel peace again
I see love from Angels
I saw no love in the past
I thought you made us perfect
I guess you're laughing last
Your thoughts don't seem much greater
But still you're better than us
Why don't you check your mirror
Will it break your trust
Instilled the ways of hate
I understand that it is too late to save you know
From all the dirt in hell
There you saw it you know it's all inside the eyes
The weakness  sadness 
To feel you've burned alive 
I forgot I could feel it
And fear it and be it
The thought that I'm alive
Unchanging my standing
I feel used up inside
I can't bear anymore
The screams have fought
Into my dreams
And the snakes they speak just like me
I see love from Angels
I saw no love in the past
I thought you made us perfect
I guess you're laughing last
Some legends uproot evil
Some made of silver  gold
But why is brimestone worthless
When we're all so cold
FuckA certain feeling assails
Visions form to wonder why
It still keeps fading
Away to the stars
The sanitarium is the night of the mind
Hidden where noone wants to know
As nightside keeps saving your life
With its silverpainted dawn
The sanitarium holds the keys of the night
In a place noone wants to know
And dance dance for staying alive tonight
And you're not alone
On and on the rains with their anaemic crystals wash the pitch away
And I will follow you through centuries of famine and there will still be horror
Nightly blood anaemia
Night and blood anaemia
As black sprites keep draining your life
When at night you're all alone
And dance dance to remain alive
As this night beholds no dawn
There at the borders
Cold and rigid guardians dressed of no life
We run and run in circles
Till the world stops spinning round
Run in circles and the world as we know it spins in silence
Till remaining breathless panting
Overwhelmed by laughter
Starry skies of stains
Ultimately sorry
Uneducated random strokes of pain
It's a chain going backwards through the veins
Must sew up this wound and run away
I can feel their strength
Through crookedlightning desert pathways
Run and run and run the pathways
branching off through time
Two lonewolves shared
the utmost silence of the time
run run the pathways as you share
the uttermost of silence
Trieste Italiana  Trieste Italiana
Sceneries far from the Sun
Far from the dust
Glide into dusk
Cobalt of Match
I see your eyes above the arch of your smile
Lost in this nighttime through the daze of its dark
I see your eyes lost in the quietness of March
In the striations of the cobalt of March
I see that this numb mourning dies
I see that this orchid was born to be taken away
I see your eyes above the arch of the sky
I see your eyes throughout the gaze of the night
I see your eyes closed in the coldness of March
Lost in the glaciers of the cobalt of March
I see that this numb mourning dies
I see that this life
Was just meant to be taken away
Centuries under the Sun
Biting the dust
I fade away into September
My soul is gonna return
And it will be for just one time
To say that nothing truly dies
And I've seen that the world
Has stopped since that time
Singing lullabies to make us all forget
And that same world fell by its own fire
And I try to cope but still cannot forget
I can't say where you are
Can't see where you are
Can't stay in the Sun
And I wonder why am I even here right now
Attending this slow parade
Of massive figures and clouds
And I'm going to kill you
For you have slain my child
Enchained me in this maze
Of your eyes and your bluest lights
Leftovers of my mind
To witness what once was
Ice in endless columns alive
I can't see where you are
Can't say where you are
Can't stay in the sunlight
In a sentimental requiem held until today
A last sparkle of renascence leading me the way
Blind I'm facing the Sun
Drag my bones onward
Yet nobody's son
Yet another last beauticracy of yours again
And in sapphire coldest rays
There's rescue under the rain
A chance to prey
The horror is through the air
Much too dark here
Pull back the curtains and let the Sun in
It flows out from inside
It builds cities and fairytales
Reachable from here through a stairway of dust
But fail to restore
The themes and rhymes and the frescoes halflights
And then smear'em with everlasting paint
It flows out from inside
Arising architheme of the Earth
Nazarene of filthless time
Spare me your goddamned wonders
And give us back the day
Reach out from the weight of the debris of the Earth
Reaching out from here with more cries
Debris of the arcade of the Earth
And I stand under the vaults
And find just the meaning of the end
As I finally walked the Sorrowful Way
Through windows of new desires
I guess I am coming to bright
Feeling the coolness of the ocean in your bright eyes
The taste of salty waves
Nascence and feel no more discomfort while
I slowly run my faint hand through the softness of your hair
Higher nascence
Nothing will ever make this magic moment vanish
Throughout the streams of time into the
Fire that purifies the memories
That purifies the hardest feelings
Hidden lost and found
The last time you met me
I thought I was alive
Through Earth wind and fire
I'm now coming to life instead
Through windows of new desires
I guess I am coming to life through
Earth wind and fire
Must clean up the way until there is no one left alive
And then there is always someone begging for the light Endtime
Time torn and thrown into preexistential oceans preritual
Must clean up the way till there's no trace left of me Endtime
Did I see me last night Then denied it today
Same solitude rite done again
It pours down upon me
Disgorging down from above
And now it's too late
Now how are you tonight
Is there any way I could be of help tonight
I write a vomit serenade of living yesterdays
I'll show you tonight that no one really wants to listen to a song that really hurts
Who'd ever want a love like a rainbow in the rain iridescent but vain
I thought you would lie
Next to me in this bed of swallowed time
And deceiving the autumn and all the remaining time
And deceiving the horror the pest and the relative slime
And the cancers and darkness behind the doors at night
Today all these things are unaware
Must clean up the way until there's not a soul left by my side
But there's always a little sign of someone meant to take good care of your heart
Hoist the sails of the night
Sail your ships towards the horizon of the sound
Where are your rhymes you suavely sang in the morning
And the morning will come again
And I land ashore in your city's mourning grey
Screaming out its wreckage screaming out loud
So I close my eyes in sorrow and back away
I had experienced the wonders of your light
And I'm witness to your passage through these times
And there's no regret at all it's all just fine
It's a blend of green and rain
The painting risen in front of us
While the vessel still keeps on sailing forward
 to the ultimate star
Where your inner essence we're told resides
Across the seven seas this odyssey is my plight
Cantus Christi vow
As today I say farewell to you
I can see me now
From a height as if I were you
I turn to Zenith now
All there is is the scent of you
I can see me now
As today I say farewell to you
There is always however a small gap
Between the sea and the sky
Where I retreat to take a break
From those monotonic chants clocking our passing time
There behind a crowd of clouds bathed in Sun
I behold these pictures to you
And that's how it goes
A song always comes to an end
Then a few more bits of silence
In a composition of stagnant water and seagulls sad
I bring your laughter back to light
And your life which you always felt as stolen
Has always been there instead
Just afraid of blooming of us
It seems so long
Shining bright
It seems so long
Shining bright
I lit the sunlight with my hands
Knowing there's to be some reason
For this ever coming dark
All I want to find is a way
For these cardboard wings to fly
Their blackened feathers up again
Not a tiny breadcrumb trace
To retrieve the lost Argentic pathway leading us away
Oh my naked angel face
Now it is my turn to drag you to tomorrow
All your light faded away
'Cause you have given all the strength you had
To someone else
Touch me and relieve me from the plague of sorrow
Touch me and heal me with your silvers colours
Touch me
I lit the sunlight with my hands
Knowing there's to be some reason
For this ever coming dark
Not a tiny breadcrumb trace
To retrieve the lost Argentic pathway leading us away
Touch me and relieve me from the plague of sorrow
Touch me and heal me with your silver colours
Touch me
I reached the Sun myself and found nothing there
To clear the reason for this ever coming grey
And all there's left to find's the way back to the fields
Of silver colours you once used to share with me
As this nights beholds no dawn
The shadow of the Earth
Abyssing your lonely watervisage
Giving us a breather from the yoke of the Star
Before utter oppression restarts
In a schism of major zones of remote dreams
Where I own the empire
You hand me the keys
And the sceptre of your playground
A parade of fast satellites across a slow nightsky
And once again it's dawn
They're made of steel and chrome
The screams propagating through
The coldness of the outer space
It's a message noone is gonna get
There in the infinite abyss of the night
And not making a noise we quietly deorbit
And the night that I gave up the way
All the songs have returned to silence
And my friend of the other side
Was the witness to that miscarriage
But the truth was not by my side
I was blinded from all those dark things
So the night that I let you go astray
Couldn't see the full extent
Of all the hate that followedYou know his son he is upon the cross
You know his word is always false
A preachers lie you cant be found
Go find God and hunt him down
Bring me the Head of God
You kill Christ
I'll kill Satan
You kill your God
Together we will kill religion
Now they are gone but not forgot
No hope for man unless they rot
Long talons
Razor sharp teeth
Thick fur
Giant wings
Deep red eyes
Hunger
Black Beast
Lying in a crypt
Await the break of day
Mind is void of thought
Guts churn with decay decay
In the graveyard
The dead shall forever rot
In the graveyard
Bodies buried in the plot
Eyes are frozen shut
Body is rigid and cold
No life in the ground
Mourners come to weep to weep
You have fallen now
From the hand of God
Come to my embrace
Triumph of the Ram
I will build this temple made from Rams horns
A tribute to our darkened lord
Come on in we welcome you
Light the candles for the dead
Burning evil scent of death
Sense of power
Thirteen years I built a structure made from rams horns
Although the Christian faith tells me to be warned
I watched it grow I made it bleed I never turned my back
I saw the horn of the ram and I made it blackThis is your one and only chance follow us and you'll be saved
This is your one and only chance follow us and you'll be saved
This one goes to all those who have fallen we will raise you up and help you forget

Rising Antichrist
Revolution treatys end
Darkest malefice
Unrelenting storm descends
Flames of unity
Firing of hate
Burnt impurity
Ashes of faith
Skeleton paradise
Borders do extend
Welcome to my realm of chaos chaos chaos
In death or glory
Chaos is my king
Toxic chemistry
Independence never tamed
Twisted zealotry
Nothing ventured
Nothing gained
Flag of liberty
Symbol of law
Blood red legacy driven by lore
Dissident symphony
Marching on to war
Welcome to my realm of chaos chaos chaos
In death or glory
Chaos is my king
Resolution
Hell on earth
Universal slaves
Nations of a new rebirth
Phoenix from an open grave
Propaganda masterminds
Fragmenting the truth
Speakers sending out the signs
Engaging with the disaffected youth
Only the strong will survive
There is no rewind
Your freedom of speech now denied
Welcome to my world of chaos 
Chaos
My world of chaos
In death or glory
Death or glory
Chaos chaos chaos
In death or glory
Chaos is my king
Look into my eyes if you wanna see
The meaning of hate
Everything I own comes from
Blood sweat toil and faith
You took a free ride to a place
Where I drew the line
Where the ladder leads down
To the depths of your self decline
Cauterized
Exorcised
Ostracized
You got left behind
You are the fuel for my fire
You are the fuel  I'm gonna make you burn
You are the fuel for my fire
You are the fuel
The fuel for my fire
Counting down the days where you're gonna feel
The forec of my wrath
Falling from state you will shatter
Like an empty glass
Justify the lies as your world
Falls apart at the seams
Like a monkey on my back
You should never seek another mans dreams
Redefined
Reasssigned
Out of mind
You got left behind
There's nowhere to run there's nowhere to hide
The anger is fuel for the hatred inside
Fire  Keeper of the flame suffocating your disdain
Fire  Everywhere you turn raging as the final bridges burn
Hostile territory
In a kingdom where the sun don't shine
Cleansed of autonomy
Disciples bringing death divine
Scourge of the military
Defenders of the holy ground
Blind ideology
The desert veils the serpents crown
Born in hatred
Born to pray
Fear conditioned to obey
Serve the master
Charge in hand
Desecrate your god forsaken land
God send the children of the sand
Self detonating
God send the children of the damned
The sacrificial lambs
War for supremacy
Insurgents in a global rebirth
Waves of atrocity
A multinational hell on earth
Bloodline philosophy
Indoctrinating twisted minds
Schooled in extremity
Inherent through the sands of time
God sent the plague of locusts
God sent the hate disease
God sent the dark september
God sent the world of enemies
Scanning thru my slaughter eyes
I hunter seek my prey
Covert in natures form
I enter to the fray
Warlord warhead
Target locked no compromise
Mindset see red
Realign engage and neutralize
I bring death divine
Killing is my aim in life
Killing is my aim in life
Killing is my aim in life
Killing is my way of life
Hatred breeds a new regime
To enemies unknown my
My gun becomes my friend
The battlefield my home
One shot one kill
Life becomes a waiting game
Blood shed blood spill
Bullet wears a number not a name
I bring death divine
Death is the one that you fear
Death is the one you never see
Death is the one who haunts you
Death is the ghost in your machine
The day has come for judgement
When justice comes to pass
A bullet screams from nowhere
Laid waste the demons of the past
In a single blast
I bring death divine
Code name slaughterize
Hell is here its the new asylum
Phase 1  ride the demon wave
This is war with extreme aggression
Horns high in a sea of rage
Battle scarred from the frontline bloodshed
Phase 2 Charge the pit and down
Bang bang bang a thousand hammer heads
Thrasing out on the hallowed ground
Louder harder faster than a mark 8 shell
Darker stronger heavier than the gates of hell
We are the chaos legions
We fight with an iron fist
We play the devils music
We are the union of the 6 6 6
66'fucking'6
Hit the floor in a pain reaction
Phase 3 A crushing wall of death
Broken limbs and a screaming siren
Body Count strike a chord for the dead
Killing light in our world of darkness
Phase 4 Its a violent dawn
Sold my soul in search of madness
Legacy of the circle born
They fear you they fear me
They fear their world of misery
They fear you they fear me
They fear the sound of devilry
The sound of world war 3
They fear me
We are we are
We are the devils legions
We are we are
We are the devils legions
66'fucking'6
You preach your tales of woe
And prophecies of old
You spill your words of hate
The truth is far from told
You are the broken man
Forever redesigned
Behold the king of kings
Deceit becomes your shrine
Deep in your christ addiction
You breed undying faith
A life of contradiction
Will see you fall from grace
YOur pain is self infliction
The mighty cross you bare
Divine in your conviction
Behind a veil of prayer
Water turned to wine
Healer to the blind
Saviour of mankind
Its crucifiction
Jesu thrice denied
Nailed and purified
Seek and you shall find
Its crucifiction
Beyond the realm of death
And Human sacrifice
Where lies the chosen one
Self righteous paradise
2000 Years and twelve
Hypocrisy remains
Who is this ghost you slave
Hollow be thy name
Deny the resurrection
Reject the hand of god
Be cleansed by your confession
Sing evolutions song
Religious misconceptions
Based on a book of lies
Evoking mass deception
The word is crucified
You pray for life
You plead for death
You bleed forgiveness
Til your final breath
You pray for sin
You plead for war
Your blood forsaken
By the hands you reached out for
Crucifiction
Deny the resurrection
Deny your christ addiction
Judas  I am sworn to avenge
The obsessor with the poison tongue
Slow death unto in the name of revenge
You seek a fragile peace but the damage is done
I will drain the lifeblood from your heart
I will tear your fucking world apart
I will spit on your grave
Dead man walking
Walking to the jaws of Hell
Dead man talking
A preacher to the ones that failed
Broken  Never king for a day
A hero in a world of one
Face down in a pool of decay
Twisted by the torment of the slaughter to come
I will drain the lifeblood from your heart
I will tear your fucking world apart
You can never be saved
History dictates that you created nothing
But a veil of lies the fact remains
Sticks and stones still the words keep coming
Dead mans dignity
Standing one foot in the grave
The lamb is led to slaughter
The lamb will beg to be released
Dead man walking
Walking to the jaws of hell
Dead man walking
A precher to the ones that failed
Dead man
Allied in duality
Revolution born
Formation of a new regime
Troopers of the perfect storm
Grinding gears of conflict
Root effect and cause
Power fuelled intoxication
Breaking down the walls
United we stand divided we fall
Defiant in peace driven by war
Brothers in arms the defenders of faith
Side by side and united in hate
The enemy of my enemy
The enemy of my enemy descends
The enemy of my enemy
The enemy of my enemy becomes my friend
Feeding on brutality
Challenging the crown
Severing the weakest links
Tribal factions duty bound
Violence with discretion
Beating at your door
Fires brun across the land
Raising all before
Designing a scheme of annihilation
Propaganda on a global scale
Puling on the strings of a puppet nation
Blood letting in a golden violent age
I recall the day of the fall
Betrayal from brothers bloodlines broken
No one but me from these eyes I can see
I heard only silence disloyaling quietus
Discontented some else a nightmare
From the dream from then alone
Without a home a cursed limbo
An army defected the loyal are lost
Believers are not dead
They just only sleep
Sleep and dream of your own memories
Revelation
See a time of reawakening
Realization now
Now the sun of our morning shall rise
Dawn has broken
Know the vengeance from you open eyes
Reawaken all
Wage the war fight all once more
Relive the sound of purest power
Born in the wilds from desperate we feed
We'll black out the silence from our own evil
Gather 'round to make the sound
A nightmare for their dreams
No more alone we'll find the home
And cleanse the dead minds
New army gathered the loyal are found
Believers are restless time for us to wake
Wake and live once again to the memories
You forsaken
Sleep is always the home of your misery
Reawaken now
Now the sun of our day remains high
Never Broken
Chase the mindwashing sleep of the night
Reawaken
Now and forever side by side
We'll seek the taken
Find and return all the rage to their eyes
Reawaken
Reawaken Never will my heart be stolen
Reawaken Never will my mind be shaken heed the call
Reawaken False ones now your bones will shatter one and all
Reawaken Time is ours and onward we will march
The unborn darkness lives in day
The youth of dusk will soon grow older
Mature into the air of black
Steal your blood from nocturne prey
Embrace a million suns much darker
Caress the other world of night
The night cooling refuge
From southern's sun so endless
A polar summer midnight's shine
Night my night day's oasis
Where all my dreams still survive
A paradise I'll lose too sun from sleep
Summer northern sunshine
Endless midnight daylight
White night insane sunshine
Madness
Go to where I'll meet the dark
The winter of polar sullen
It's where the noon is filled with black
Give your eyes to evil's play
Gaze upon a moon much truer
The strength of arms that hold
The Night
The Night inspiration
For my own silent pleasures
Let fall the star of earthly life for my night
Night my night light forsaken
Where my power is alive
A paradise that's found earth's own shade
Winter polar darkness
Endless midday nighttime
All night lost is sunshine
Eternal night
Come and see where your loyal shadows always betray
Come with me once cleansed of fear
Night's love will make you stay
Autumn days grow shorter
Colder nights grow longer
Seasons change through time
Forever night still seeking
Darker places call me
Hiding doesn't cure me
Expose my whole being to the night
Dream forever forever I dream
Ten thousand galaxies away
Rests the world of hallowed waters
Two suns that shine on Labyrinthine
Reflections of the seven crescents
Icons of the gods once worshipped
Control the lands of seldom seen
Shifting rising falling
Seven centuries pass by
The seventh cycle tide arrives
Seven levels mark the worth of men  divided
The low  A barren expose of nonhigh covers all but cream of men
One land exists above the oceans amethyst garden
Lost whispers calling
I am one man with two dreams inside
Shared by my last kingless queen
Dry above the waters high
Lie the sifts of cirrus tower
Keeps cold and dry my love unseen
Safe is she from waters raging
Cold death will I soon be facing
Unless my call will make me king
Endless waters rising
Denied  passage to the towers climb
The wall that's safe from the sixth tide
Near is the high water that we have forever
The mark  chosen for me at birth
The worth  of my heart unbounded
No sea of judgment can decide the fate that dreams make
Feel me softly
When your almond eyes close out the light
Hear the voices in dark waves
the promised sound of sleep
Tides are rising from your tears
Not from moons or science theory
Lonely is your mind of dreams awake
hear my answers
And one heart will keep beating
Awake to a returned sunlight sky
For my dreams have christened
The sole one is me that breaths
The sea  I am chosen
Away  from this lifeless land seen today
Hand in hand I meet my queen
The air of honor is whole again
We now descend
One together
The end of loneliness we shall achieve
The emerald sky also has eyes
Still forever
Or at least until the life in our eyes die
Our oceans still create the rain
And soothes our sleep
Dream forever forever I dream
Evil will follow
Faculty X speaks to me and again it's calling
I feel it warning me of something darker than kind purpose
Always I the rod of lightning from the blackest clouds advancing
Finding seeking me to haunt my days of virtue
It's not me yet they all think so melancholy mercenary
I'm just here a bystander stealing borrowing the peace
Cool and calm is my true nature burning madness perceiving
Stay away I am the force
You feel in my presence
Keep far beware it is me
Evil does follow
Traveling to distant places does not matter because it's isolation that gives the
strength to use the blade
Two men fight and one will win with a knife of steel that cuts through tin
and I am just the witness who was not the cause
To kill and see the crimson blood flow intoxicating visions blind me
Still with fear I dare not move glassy eyes filled with salt tears
Try to warn I will soon infect try to keep the peace it's failing
Stay away I am the force
You feel in my presence stay far when I am near
Believe my real danger
Keep far beware it is me
Evil does follow
Where evil does follow is where I have been
Unfortunate sorrow finds just where I am
Where evil will follow is where I'm going to
Try to outpace it's maneuvers too deadly
I'm where evil follows
Where evil does follow is where I have been
And all the blame it spawns comes back to where I am
Where evil will follow is where I'm going to
I have now accepted it's cause from me to you
evil will follow
Where evil does follow
Is where I have been
evil does follow
Might as well just use it's power for my revenge
my evil's followed
Where evil will follow is where I'm going to
where evil follows
Don't you dare and try to follow its power too
End of days my greatest fear
My body tires and sleep is near
Close my eyes and I will pray for dreams of rapture
But still it comes the storm of spiraling clouds of nightmares chasing
me
Fed from boiling seas of sorrow blackened yawns of deadpan horror
Stand upon these shores and wait for my own storm
Learn to endure like always before My eyes will see
If I hold on I'll be within the soothing center calming restful solace
Try to enter
Not forever in the eye of the nightmare
As you enter feel the eye of the nightmare
Trapped inside the violent eye of the nightmare
Lucid colors sees the eye of the nightmare
Try to run but in all dreams our bodies fail we want to sleep
Kin and loved ones torn apart by winds of torture
Be still I feel a million legs of angry insects hungry I sense
Peel away from faceless children from them I hear young screams of terror
Hold my body down so scared without the sound
My lost dreams found frightened all around
It's just a dream
Hold on and I'll soon be within the guarded peaceful quiet sunlit
palace
Try to stay here
Now forever in the eye of the nightmare
Peace I will find from the eye of the nightmare
Lost inside behind the eye of the nightmare
within the end behind the
Tearful madness sees the eye of the nightmare
always open is the
Frozen lies and frozen stares of subconscious thoughts they're not really
here
The only to leave the eye is through the storm wall
Dreams of burning dreams of drowning
They're all just to me elementary nightmares
I'll stay in the eye and sleep forever sweat through the storm
Hope I can wake
As the storm clouds fade it looks like I will wake to another day
All's well now until I see the sun fall down only close one eye
Here within my walls so safe and warm my darkness
Light is not a factor
Stay what will I may think today wrong and clever
Selfish sings the inner clever seed
Walk away don't try to know me
I've claimed my maud' from unperfect days
I'll take what's mine from my divine methods still proven
These thoughts I have you questions were not meant for you eyes to see
Why should I know you what can you do that helps me
Reap and eat my lustful harvest
leave there's nothing here and I don't care about your spoken concerns of
my nature
Dare to try to really know me
I'll leave you lost just to find my way
So satisfied of your demise no more a burden
These thoughts I feel existing were always for my eyes to see
No handed doom there is no gloom no hint of violent hatred
Feel what I can feel
And then you'll find the hallway to my darkest room
The love I make for me is chosen you've come too soon
From the pain of past and broken nothing for you to see
Why so long have I been waiting
Just to let fate be dictating you cannot steal my fear
Seasons of unrest approaching it's all now becoming clear
Careful in my dark selecting just how many years
Feelings teem of constant irate through many tears
God help those who stand in my way I've learned it was always there
I want to gain everything unchastened so scared at first
Chip away at my frustrations but when revealed I then was healed
Seven sins of deadly beckon
No force of divine will stop me to know I rule my world
Evil is a state of free mind I will have it my own way
Treasures that all seek I will find don't look away
Look away
Or you will see man's darkest room
Do away now that you know me
The nature of evil I understand perfectly clear
Forever mine is my own mind you cannot shatter
Such thoughts the world still questions are not meant for their eyes to
see
One more year just past today
A year ago I felt the same
Trapped in a lost situation
And solutions are too complicated
One more year will pass again
The hourglass just starts to end
The time I need lays before me
To kill my neverending story
In due time sands won't fall
May the moment freeze so I can take time to keep
I'll see
What is evermoving
closer seemed so far away
In time  tomorrow will become today
What is left behind forever is too far away
In time  the past will only stay
In time  all that's left is my stone name
One more tear just fell today
A tear that tries to wash my pain
Wasted in a useless location
Not in mind was this dull vocation
One more tear will pass again
A wishful thought my only friend
So much time I have now before me
I'll start to write my unknown story
In due time sands will fall
When my moment comes
I'll keep the time that I need
To have
Tomorrow what was ever moving closer is now here today
In time  I'll forget my lonely days
No sorrow  I have left behind forever my voidfilled days
In time  the past will breathe my name
Tomorrow  gone away and moving onward to better days
In time  I'll laugh the nights away
No sorrow  try for now to see forever my gloryfilled days
In time  all time will know my name
In time  in time we'll see the end
Who saw the last star fall
Who heard the first note of death's song
Why is it now I have to wait
No place to hide no true escaping
Left all alone for no man's sake
My planet home will lose today
Who can feel the ocean's cry
Who will bid the last blue sky goodbye
I've lived only half of my life to be
Not chosen was this day of mine time unwinds
Today we all share the same destiny
Tomorrow our fate will be all as one
Who saw the last rose bloom
Who tasted life's sweet end too soon
Now I can feel the mountains shake
All cities obliterated
Farthest from the fist I stand
The last one to die is my plan
Who makes our nightmares true
Who first knew there's nothing we can do
The fires will burn all except the sky
The sun will be leaving us soon time to die
Today we'll all have the same destiny
Tomorrow our fates will be all as one
I'll wait here
As Lucifer's last star does fall
I'll be here
I shall leave all of my thoughts to you
At the end again my autumn wind will blow
I've returned to a place once lived
A cold cave filled with tears
A lost retreat from the storm that came
And killed green lands now barren
I remember remember so well
This place I left long ago
Back with the lost by the Road of Lose
The sorrow so hopeless the dark it smothers me
The past of spring gave damn to here
Victorious I led my own exilefrom here
Now winter's come to freeze my core
By fire I shall warm
The winds will howl yet I will hear song
Through dark of night I await the dawn
The prize I once had the life I then lost
Was written recited and challenged by the same
Soul that sits and waits not long
For once I found my way
Once is all too much
Yet twice seems not enough
For failure need
Yet without dark no light
A side of sadness mine
Even through death I'll find my triumph
There is no true horizon
That I won't sail succeed or fail
I dare myself the will
Every garden has a wall I must climb
Every triumph is a journey
Every road has a destination
Why do mine lead all to dead ends
Every day I lose ten hours for another's profit
My free time will just get postponed
Just to sleep and face the next day
Promises were never fulfilled
But never broken
I have gotten good at waiting
Such a thing for me to practice
For my future's never certain
My past is in stone
And I know the more things do change
The more I'll just remain insane
Today is not good for dying
No reason for my fear to stop me here
Strong is the wind of triumph
That's evercoming clear
My day is near
Once is all we want
But once is not enough
For triumph's need
It's when we see
Born the light from dark
The sadness is now far
My death no longer alive
I'll stay alive
My true horizon the sea I'll sail
Succeed or fail
I am my will
No looking back into the black
My triumph's clear
My triumph's here
The only true love i ever knew
was behind those downcoast eyes
The only comfort i ever felt
was during those long hours of loneliness
when i felt for you
i do believe
Only innocence can save the world
NightwishThe mournful sound of a bell people in prayer
My body abandoned in the solitude of the wood imprisoned
By the rags compelled to suffer from the frostry contact with
The ground
In the unbroken silence I'm seized with shuddering
I turn into matter and then into dust
She flew up
An imperceptible ascent in the knowledge dimension
She penetrates the darkest maze of the infinite universe
My ignorant body will never know the eternity formulas
Uh I'm still She's fluid I'm frozen She's wrapped up in the
Warmest blows of knowledge she flies free
The secret will be revealed to her the ingenious one
The rooms are crowded the dances begin in the euphory of the
Party the orgy frenetically takes place but the last room the
Black one is lonely
Solitary presence an ebony clock the mute echo of the pauses
After every lugubrious stroke
The black walls eclipse the room the band interrupts an euphoric
Melody wide open eyes under the mask are seeking after a veil of
Certitude terro and uneasiness in the hearts the strokes stop
The music plays again the dances get livelier a playful shouting
Spreads somebody has forgotten to someone else if's only a fain
Memory time goes cruelly by
The pendulumclock strucks midnight the pauses are painfullly
Endless the dances stop again twelve long strokes call the
Attention to a lugubrious figure tall and slender wrapped in
A sudarium
The mask represents the red death
The bloodstained cloak the broad forehead a still corpse's face
Its glassy stare It slowly moves with regal bearings as if it's
Stirred by a cold wind and passing it sows a cursed horror
Pestilence among the masters pestilence among the servants
Pestilence among all the guests
An ona a death carpet it victoriously disappears in the black room
Luz alumbrando un destino
Que abre sus alas al fin
Sé que hoy comienza un camino
La lucha hacia un juego sin fin
Hoy tengo fuerzas para romper
Las cadenas que me atan aquí
Rozar el cielosentir la tierra
Dejar volar mi alma hacia tí
Y busqué mi sueño en cada atardecer
Errante cruzada encaminé
La fuente de mi poder
Hoy volveré a conquistar
Horizontes de gloria y de paz
Quizá no vuelva jamás
Pero así alcanzaré
Mi ideal
Voy encendiendo una llama
Que arde oculta en mi interior
Y es un grito de esperanza
Que busca huir del dolor
Buscaré mi sueño en cada amanecer
Forjado en el cielo que es mi piel
Ya nunca me detendré
Hoy volveré a conquistar
Horizontes de gloria y de paz
Quizá no vuelva jamás
Pero así alcanzaré
Mi ideal
Siento que un nuevo día nace en mi
Al fin mi alma lucha por vivir
El horizonte que construyo al andar
Vuelca su mirada en mi
No sé qué es lo que me habré de encontrar
El lecho de estrellas no muestra el final
Mirando al sol comprendí que su luz
Hoy brilla sólo por mi
Pétreas miradas vigilan mi andar
Fuego en el cielo desiertos de sal
No miro atrás pero en mi corazón
Guardo el calor de mi hogar
Volveré a rozar su piel no me detendré
Me da fuerzas para avanzar el llanto que un día derramé
El Largo viaje ya llega a su fin
Sé que mi destino está aquí
Volveré a rozar su piel no me detendré
Me da fuerzas para avanzar el llanto que un día derramé
Volveré a rozar su piel y no me detendré
Avanzaré por cuanto aquel día lloré
El destino guardó gloria para mi
En su seno en batalla descubrí
A una bella mujer enfrentada junto a mí
Su voz atravesó mi alma
Entre gritos del odio apareció
Una luz que fue fugaz pero duró
El instante en que miró a mi noble corazón
Apagó el fuego de mi venganza
Déjame intentar
Mostrarte mi alma a través de los ojos que ven más allá
He encontrado la gloria
Tu luz mi victoria no eres mi rival
Su rostro entre el polvo desapareció
Mi recuerdo del olvido rescató
Y grabó en mi corazón más allá de mi interior
El eterno cantar de su mirada
Déjame intentar
Mostrarte mi alma a través de los ojos que ven más allá
He encontrado la gloria
Tu luz mi victoria no eres mi rival no eres mi rival
No eres mi rival
Sé que del odio ha de nacer
Una llama que en tu piel
Y en tu sangre te hablará de nosotros dos
El destino guardó gloria para mí
En mi vida nace un nuevo resurgir
Tengo clavada en mi piel la esperanza de saber
Encontrar juntos el camino
Déjame intentar
Mostrarte mi alma a través de los ojos que ven más allá
He encontrado la gloria
Tu luz mi victoria no eres mi rival
Si miro atus ojos sé que es lo que un día busqué
Luchar morir ¿por qué sin tí
En la batalla comprendí
El porqué del fuego que hay dentro de mí
Inmerso en el fragor del combate
Sólo una idea en mi la victoria
Pero oculto en mi interior
Un vacío por llenar escapa a mi comprensión
su fuerza
El invierno anida en mi
No consigo adivinar para qué he llegado aquí
te meta
Oculto en el dolor me enlazaste
Sólo una idea en mi la derrota
Algo no logro entender
Siento extraño su poder fiel tomé el camino a él
me arrastra ah
Ven cuanto buscas tiene respuesta en mi
¿Qué es
Un destello y creo que me habla a mi
Fui forjado para ti al fin te encontré
Siente mi fuerza en tus manos
En mi la fuerza de cuantos lucharon
Mi victoria hoy es vuestra
He encontrado cuanto busqué
Ya no puedo luchar sin ti
Mis fuerzas terminan aquí
La luz que un día eperanza me dió
Se desvanece ante mi
Habrá miedo y oscuridad
Hoy se adueñan de mi
Soledad triste final
Hoy muere parte de mi
En estos parajes
Mil y una batallas tuvieron lugar
Un pueblo en tinieblas
Luchó con valor por librarse del yugo del mal
Y la tierra no aguantó tanto dolor
Morada de espectros
El mal triunfó encarnado en la desolación
Sólo un recuerdo
Perdura encendiendo la llama de su corazón
El hombre no respetó la ley
Y entre estas tierras fue
Condenado a perecer
Y todavía hoy
Se puede escuchar a la tierra llorar
Ante tanto dolor la sangre le inundó
Las entrañas de la vida y el amor
Batallas y lances
Muerte y dolor acechaban en cada rincón
Ya no queda nada
Que sobre estas tristes tierras pueda ver el sol
El hombre no respetó la ley
Y entre estas tierras fue
Condenado a perecer
Y todavía hoy
Se puede escuchar a la tierra llorar
Ante tanto dolor la sangre le inundó
Las entrañas de la vida y el amor
Y ya no crecen flores sólo hay soledad
El cielo ha oscurecido el sol nunca saldrá
Y no iluminará
Y el hombre no respetó la ley
Y entre estas tierras fue
Condenado a perecer
Llanto en la oscuridad
Una lágrima de dolor correrá
Y todavía hoy
Se puede escuchar a la tierra llorar
Ante tanto dolor la sangre le inundó
Las entrañas de la vida y el amor
Y ya no crecen flores sólo hay soledad
El cielo ha oscurecido el sol nunca saldrá
Y no iluminará
Su corazón no iluminará
Su luz no está
Desapareció en la devastación
De la oscuridad
Capturó su voz
El vacío cruel de la
Palidez fatal que helada va
Mirando ausente el final
Gloria y fama son un vacío más
La guerra ignora amar
Y ahora estoy
Encerrado en la oscuridad de su luz
Siendo nada
Sólo un sueño que va más allá de la muerte
Espera envolverme en sus alas
El dulce amor de su alma
Para llevarme eternamente
Con su profundo mirar
Y al fin poder sentir
Sus manos sobre mi
Llevando hacia el olvido el dolor
Tras tantos años lejos de aquí
Por fin regresa a su hogar
En esta guerra sin fin
Su único amigo fue el mar
En muchas batallas luché
Dolor y victorias viví
Pese a la gloria y todo el poder
Aún ansío volver
La sangre del enemigo
El mar de rojo tiñó
Sentí la nobleza en el pecho
Y soledad en mi interior
Tras la ilusión de partir
Por triunfos y gloria alcanzar
Descubrí al estar ahí
Que perdí mi libertad
En muchas batallas luché
Dolor y victorias viví
Pese a la gloria y todo el poder
Aún ansío volver
La sangre del enemigo
El mar de rojo tiñó
Sentí la nobleza en el pecho
Y soledad en mi interior
En mi corazón juro confesar
Hoy volveré a comenzar
La sangre del enemigo
El mar de rojo tiñó
Sentí la nobleza en el pecho
Y soledad en mi interior
En mi interior
Tras años de guerra regresa a su hogar
Cargado de horribles recuerdos
La gente se agolpa al verle llegar
Aplauden al fiel caballero que vuelve del mar
Historias de gloria quieren escuchar
La derrota del mal en mis manos
Mas sólo conservo despues de luchar
Vacío golpeando mi voluntad
cuando el mal reino en tu corazón
Mi rostro alivio todo tu dolor
De tierras lejanas volviste al fin
Mi pueblo aclama triunfante tu llegada
La gloria es tuya pues tu eres el último caballero
Un día partí buscando luz
Crucé las tierras para servir
A un ideal que nunca existió
Dejando muerte y dolor
Por donde pasé
¿Dónde esta dónde fue aquel que nos liberó
Eres tu un dios mortal tu don la libertad
es tuyo el cielo encierra el recuerdo
Hoy reina otra realidad
Tiempos de gloria fruto de victoria
Contigo un nuevo despertar
Pero cuando descubrió
Aquel milagro entre el horror
Entendió que su destino no era el mismo que el del sol
El morirse cada dia para volver a nacer
Sino amar permanecer firme ante el olor de su piel
hoy regresó
Nos trae su voz
Queremos saber
Que es lo que pasó
A cuántos la muerte diste
Mostrando el valor
Salvando el honor
Que en todo tu pueblo existe
Victorias en tu haber
Regresas con riqueza y fama
¿por qué no eres feliz
¿por qué miras al cielo y lloras
Con un susurro el aire desperto
Mejores tiempos que mi alma olvido
Mis días son un largo caminar
Cruel destino ya no hay vuelta atrás
Yo busqué una vida mejor
La encontré y se desvaneció
Si miro al cielo me invade el recuerdo
Del rostro que ya no volverá
Toda la gloria el ansia de vistoria
Son sólo sueños de un mortal
Mañana un nuevo caminar
Se abre ante mis pies
Dame fuerzas para seguir
La muerte un día vendrá
Y en sus alas tal vez
Vuelva a estar cerca de ti
Junto a ti
Ayer en tus manos tuviste el poder
Y hoy un inmenso vacío en tu ser
la tristeza anida en tu corazon
Mi voz de nuevo calma tu dolor
Todo en lo que siempre creí
Se burla hoy de mi
Cruel el destino
Me impuso el camino
Que desterró mi libertad
Fiel marioneta  en sus manos fui presa
De su voluntad
Un horizonte gris
Lloraba tras de mi
El mayor triunfo está
En poder mirar hacia atrás
No podeis entender
La angustia de mi ser
El mayor triunfo fue
Poner mi alma a sus pies
Mil batallas podría ganar
Pero hubo una que nunca
Pude alcanzar
Yo no he podido vencer al destino
Ni a mi corazón
El último caballero
A esta tierra regresé
Lo que buscaba encontréI live in the thoughts where the shadows no longer dance
and where my tears fall into the colours of the lonely dreaming crying
songs that my works are
The melancholy clouds of my feelings float away in the tide of faces
which the soul of mine is
I wonder about life even though death is close and as my lost life
falls into its definitive end
the light won't save me Tired is the blood of mine and my brain will
not speak no more
I'm living in a prison of flesh and my heart won't answer my calls
I'm shaking as I'm crying and as I feel the last drops of my life
leave my useless cold body
to walk the night I'm one with the night I AM
 I am the face and blood of knowledge
 I am the pure heart of wisdom
I smell the night sing its sleeping ancient lullaby
and the nonexisting star horizon burnt its candle
Find the dark in my eyes
I'm not and I'm all
I'm the end of the beginning
 What do my eyes hide 
I hear the winter breathe and spread his message of cold
and the clouds change their eyes and forget the time
I feel the skin of the trees listen and walk away
and the moon dreams and I hear its eternal call
I taste the depths of the sea in my eyes and fly
and the lips of dust play its song forevermore
I sea the colours of the world disappear in the mist
and the bright tear of my smell fear the morning
I'm kneeling down on the forest's deiny ground
sun of the infinite sky doesn't reach me here
Oh darkness embrace me blood stop circulating
the mist surrounds me as I'm falling away my trance
My blackened teeth chew at the air we breathe
 lean its shapeless nothingness from the holy spirit
Poisoned I am by his holy feeble godness
 I spit him out in a bloody flood of phlegm
Their world is turned inside out
I take their lips to my mouth
The people lies in articulo mortis
I spread my wings and fly away
I'm the face of the night in which you all will drown
I'm the power the almighty dark everlasting strength
my body was for a moment cold and left alone
still my breath is a sick unken smell
Flying through the night sky among the stars
the air caresses my naked soul
I've reached Ophthalamia's darkest parts
the evil desolate shore
The icy water whips the ancient rocks
I see the black blooded sea of RagiihNib
the mountains of MakubuKeen have guided me
oh stars now hear my scream
Give me the Sign Shores of KaaTaNu
 Give me the Sign
The water raised above me and the sky died
oh lord of all accept my soul Take me
keep on searching son maybe you'll succeed
so cold everlasting night here I am
Give me the Sign
Try to find the keys of wisdom
Sathanas will guide your quest
and when you'll have found'em
the chosen place is for you
Atmosphere of nothingness nevermore pride
A useless existence cast to the outer side
Searching since ages to find a clue
To enter a state joining what's true
Lost and unable to break itself out
Forever to drift where no one hears his shout
 Little child of light so full of life so bright
 you saved people from sin and everything they kept within
Love and joy you taught and had your foolish followers caught
as they were weak and left behind esaily fooled by your leader kind
you told them to have faith in a god so good and great
a heaven they would see if they death would meet with thee
So when hate grew in the air
to fight it you said you dare
with the holy ghost at your side
defeat instead of pride
Shadows from darkness came
unleashing the wrath no one can tame
holy blood were spilled on the ground
and with this all goodness drowned
oh little child of light you did die that night
But in the first hand they should live
with the intention of goodness give
degradation of their will
you thought evil was so easy to kill
The sky has frozen to ice and from the ground the dark ones rise
your cross is still in heavens sign but the inverted one is mine
we'll make known that the words you spoke were promises you broke
My castle of blood beyond deepest sorrows lies distant clouds
its grey tower puncture the sky
 the pain
My skin the gloomy ground will not swallow thee
the echoes of my black heartbeat falls forevermore
 living further
My heart it cries
it slowly dies
castle of no repair
 stop the pain
 This paper have gone creased of all these dripping tears of mine
 but I won't change it so that you'll see my grief
The grey cloudness heaven weeps in its painfull anguish
the mistfilled morning outside is paralysing my mind
my eyes are like to fading ravens on a snowfilled sky
my features are as dying and fading as the rivers of love
This is the pain called sorrow
my scream echoes in the night
this is the notomorrow
my useless everlasting fight
 reality bleeds
Snowdressed whispers gently fall down on silent ground if visions in
beauty
ahh under the stars the ancient trees watch my cry
the horizon is filled with black bird singing moaning songs
as my last breath caresses my lips watch me leave
Who lays a thought on me now as I lie here forgotten 
my eyes memories have been wiped away
the speech of my mouth can't be awaken no more
my hair which once played with the wind have stopped it's game
Don't wake me up 
I sit in loneliness and watch the meaning of my past
It dances and twitches then it lays down and dies
I see the morning sky tremble and then it open and begin to cry
as night falls and darkness fills my room whispering thoughts haunt
me
my candle burns low
Can I find my fate  Can I be one with my desire 
The perchment of my future burns fast and I burn myself
badly in my futile attempt to save it
The black blood of my heart weeps in every tear a part of myself
I have features of youth but a soul of age
Why can't I see the web of lies my life is based upon so I can cut
them
and become one with the sky  I long for the harmony the peace
within me
I wish to see myself in the burning light of truth and no longer be a
victim of hate
I search for the purity in me I search in my blood
I open my vein to see what ever it may be
And as the red rivers of my life flow from its tunnels and caves
I see lies and falseness die
I'm fading away drowing in a thick mist of burning ice
I'm showered in the blood of dying hate and I feel pure
I'm taken to the breast of my truth and I'm rebornYou're hanging around my door
Trying to change my ways
Telling me what's in store
About the end of days
People behind you yeah
Saying you speak what's true
But I don't need you girl
Telling me what to do oh no
You'll never change my ways
'cause I'm a heretic
You'll never change my ways
'cause I'm a heretic
Oh yeah
You walk beside me
Waving that book around
Clutching your cross oh yeah
Pointing me to the ground
But I don't need you no
I found my way long ago
My master's inside me yeah
He ain't telling me what to know oh no
You'll never change my ways
'cause I'm a heretic
You'll never change my ways
'cause I'm a heretic
Oh yeah
Alright now
Oh yeah
Alright
Oh no
Oh no
You'll never change my ways
'cause I'm a heretic
You'll never change my ways
'cause I'm a heretic
Oh yeah
Heretic
Heretic
Heretic
Darkness is folding its cold wings around me
Feeling the time pulse in my veins
Wolves in the shadows they circle in waiting
Eyes filled with lust they've come for their claim
The joys of this life are fading behind me
Bargains in blood are now coming due
Witches are singing their song to their master
Lord of the world I'm soon passing to
I am falling away
I am falling away
I am falling away
I am falling away oh yeah
Mine was a life lived in the shadow
Of Lucifer's cross hanging over my head
No one can change where these rivers are flowing
Waters of crimson that carry the dead
I am falling away
I am falling away
I am falling away
I am falling away oh yeah
Wheels of misfortune
Slowly unwind
Lucifer's legions
Biding their time
Tortured in shadow
Waiting my day
King of deception
I am now falling away
Falling away
Falling away
Falling away
Falling away
Falling away
Falling away
Falling away
Oh no falling away
Falling away
Gaze of steel and stride of thunder
All that stands comes crashing under
He does wander like a spirit lost
Burning soul for he shall know no other
He walks but nobody sees him
He talks but no one hears his cry oh no
He who walks alone
Like a shadow moving unseen
Last of his kind endless searching
He shall meet his end upon this Earth
No one left to tell his lonely story
He walks but nobody sees him
He talks but no one hears his cry oh no
He who walks alone
He is alone in a world that he never can feel
No one to touch to be real searching in darkness again
All who he sees shall not ever smile into his eyes
No reason to live or to die he is the last of his kind
He who walks aloneWithin the rise of unconstraint
unveils the force of love and hate
Inside the reign of eyes and teeth
resides the rule of war and peace
Beneath the rising of refrain
proceeds the ceasing of abstain
Enclosed in truth adverse to lies
nflames the tainted soul of life
Within the force of spurning needs
resides cognition so complete
Reduce the lies that scourge the earth
and cause the rising of rebirth
By way of light that breaches dark
ascends the morning of the stars
Within the wretched soul of man
subjects purgation of demand
By way of discontent I see
beyond confinement and decease
By means of falsified untruth
I plunge a spear inside of truth
I hold a sword within my hand
engraved of Phosphorous extant
Reduce the lies that scourge the earth
and cause the rising of rebirth
So what is so wrongabout lust
Isn't it just natural to acknowledge excitement
accept your instincts
and truly rejoice in the pleasures of your body and mind
So what is so wrong about pride
Isn't it just natural to put oneself above the capability of others
and truly cherish ones own accomplishments
rather than those of the average and ignorant
'I stand in the rising of a new dawn
watching Lucifer wander through the sweet dew of morning'
So what is so wrong about envy
Isn't it just natural to sometimes feel envious
when realizing that someone else
is of greater possession
So what is so wrong about greed
Isn't it just natural to seek for further wealth and comfort
rather than to satisfy the yearnings of acquisition
with the portions already provided
So what is so wrong about gluttony
Am I not justified and proficient enough
to excessively indulge in my individual pleasures
and decide for myself that which is best for me and my being
So what is so wrong about wrath
Am I not entitled to wish for the harm and smite of others
especially to those
whom are unjust and spiteful to me
So what is so wrong about sloth
Am I not capable enough to decide for myself
when it is time to work time to play and time to sleep
as long as I am willing accept the consequences of my actions
I give praise to the seven deadly sins
And I rather rule in hell
than serve in heaven
My loved doll in rubber thong
You know to whom you do belong
Your garters hold your stocking strains
Tender love within restraint
Tightened strings crown your back
6inch heels enhance your feet
Seductress who belongs to me
Naked Things detained in lace
I show you love I show you grace
Nipples firm but in disguise
Fastened garters dress your thighs
A corset holds your body lush
With lustful bonds of sanctioned trust
In stockings you emerge to me
My loved doll in 6inch heels
In robes arrayed by will disclosed
Reveals of cleft of stainless rose
Your legs unfold with stockings wed
By cords confined in eagle spread
A tender rose aroused by touth
Where pleasure streams of boundless lust
Submit to joy with palms exposed
I love command you love control
Hands affixed with bonds confined
Restrained to serve for love sublime
A cleft of rose where pleasures dwell
By way of lust the flower swells
A lovers kiss on rosy lips
As recondite as lust depicts
Amid two legs of silken hose
Unveils a cleft of stainless rose
In the grassy fields where the world goes to sleep
 We kissed this world goodbye  Again
The distance evinced a drama of conflict
Where angels where gruesome and devils where good
The beauty of heaven falling to pieces
We witnessed the ending of time where we stood
A drunken Messiah wielding his cross
Whispering secrets of living in loss
No one cared he burst out in tears
In the grassy fields where the world goes to sleep
Paradise sacred rented with swords
Angels in chariots going to war
A time to perish a time to thrive
In the grassy fields we kissed this world goodbye
Again
When reason is dead and the fools are made kings
the wind will decline and the trees will stop singing
When balance is lost and silence is gold
not much will remains of the truth that we told
When love is condemned and weakness is might
then lonesome are we who succumb to the delight
When yielding is just and vassals adored
then life will decline to upsurge no more
When pleasure and sorrow are pledged to be wed
the sun and the moon will descend to be dead
When falsehood is honored for tainting truth
the ending is near and our lives destitute
When comfort has died to leave room for remorse
then hope is forlong both with kingdom and horse
But facing the end with a grin and a sword
injustice will part to the sound of discord
Among the roses where I stand
torn and scratched disguised by blood
I watch the puppets stagger in their unlife
caught in the web of perplexity
'I glorify myself
I glorify myself for who I am
I glorify myself
I glorify myself for what I am'
Screams of frustration echo
while my feet walk across the shells of the damned
In these realms of demise
where life seeks its mark
Listen to my laughter
high upon the wind
I walk the path of my choice
trampling those who seek to stand in my way
A bright glowing star
shines almost invisible
down into the crypts in the city of worms
where life pursues in darkness
This is my life
and I rightfully praise myself for my accomplishments
My intellect guides me
as my life ceaselessly progresses
the Blind are leading
the Blind are leading the Blind
In aimless quest they stride aligned
A blinded horde towards decline
Without the forte to feel or see
I contemplate deficiency
On sloping trails their quest proceeds
To find at length a way to see
They search above they search beneath
I contemplate deficiency
Holding hands they stumble forth
A sightless pack a search of 4
Lacking forte they feel to see
I contemplate deficiency
Bruised and torn they stride ahead
Towards a fate of certain death
They lead the way for fools to be
I contemplate deficiency
Every voluntary sexual experience
is ultimately more positive and conferring
when utilized as a sexual encounter
regardless of the outcome
then any intense and compelling sexual fantasy
never utilized
I believe masturbation to be truly gratifying
and a natural expression of human sexuality
And loving yourself
both literally and physically
is truly the initial stage
of any true and unconditional love
Let's celebrate
the exploration of the human body
Let's celebrate
the exploration of the human mind
and the excitement that is possible to disclose
from employing ones true and profound desires
What is truly a greater stimuli
than the thriving sexuality of human imagination
Acknowledge and embrace your true sexual nature
as a good orgasm
certainly confers an equal measure of energy
to any variety of ritual sacrifice
Salvage is close at band Whispers an idle man
patiently waiting salvation to come
Aptitude yet unsung gusbing of devildom
factual salvage but likely for some
Blessing  is found in he freedom and clemency
retches a man in his quest for relief
We are the gods who reap virtues of barren needs
only the apt are predestined to be
'Christ was of subterfuge evil disguised for good
human indulgence must be realized
God was a wicked man forged out of reprimand
founded to binder abundance to rise
Kingdoms will rise and fall change is the source of all
ruin ensues in the course of renewal
Tears they will fall for me purging the chastity
aptitude rising by reason of zeal'
Conquest before the fall Thou can not love them all
love under will is the whole of the law
Tales of the humankind carved in the heart of time
failure to learn will resolve in decline
Abstinence is in vain pleasure without restraint
aptitude gained in convergence with will
God of eternal life save us from all these lies
rages a man in constraint of denial
Regarding the plains of the faithful and prude
a land that is soiled and misused
Enshrouded by alms in the seeking of truth
depleted and absent from use
Man seeks forgiveness for deeds all so idle
questing compassion from forces unknown
No one but man for its conducts is liable
in spite of the lies that are told
I pass you my dagger I pass you my torch
renting a slit in my palm
I pass you my chalice lets fill it with blood
together with seeds of our love
Disrobed but in stockings you dance in the fires
seized by affections of lust
For progress and fortune ourselves we are liable
our godly potential we trust
Behold the snake consume its tail
Convergence in design entailed
Serpent on the course of scales
Infinity will yet prevail
Creation spawns from stone and tree
Destruction sorts and oversees
Renewal sees rebirth to be
As life withstands in trinity
Among the trees beneath the sea
The serpent reigns incessantly
The earth reforms and alternates
By way of change we emanate
Creative force of ravage needs
Distinguishes what's ceased to be
In trails of capacity
Life resolves the obsolete
Serpent of perpetuity
Consumes its tail for life to be
Like a crushing stone
ripples the surface
of a silent water pond
Like burning flames
caress the skin
of those who spend eternity
in their own imaginary hell
Like roses perish
and perpetualy fall
from time in constant motion
Man always forgets
that it is governed and separated
by the same axioms that separate
the weak form is strong
The capable from the incompetent
The ingenious from the dumb
The brilliant from the foolish
This certitude never dies
This certitude never beckons
But forever lives on
'That is the law of Nature
Everything lives by this rule
and dies by this rule
Mankind is no exception
The only exception is that
Mankind believes to be beyond
this rule of natural selection
and which ultimately will lead
to mankind's inevitable selfdestruction'
Like blood streams
from an open wrist
of the resolute and suicidal
Like gleaming stars
twinkle at dusk
to silently dim and forever expire
Like rain falls
from a clouded sky
ending the drought
and the thirst below
Watching the sun coming my way 
I am lost in the road to find life 
I was searching alone in the dark 
I am lost oh Lord let me back 
And my life's gone oh it's meaningless 
Lord I am suffering 
Please come and save me now 
Then I saw her her eyes burnt through my soul 
Life felt so beautiful 
Love's what has saved me now 
I was crying on the night that I saw her 
Fell in love on that very same day 
I was desperately in need for her feelings 
I will strive for her heart till the end 
In the end that's all that should count 
Love is our guiding light 
In crossing through this world 
And I'm walking on a clear path 
Now I know what life's about 
And I'm saying goodbye to the dark 
When you're walking down your lonely road 
Search inside to find the truth 
Let your feelings guide you 
Love made me live again 
It's my advice to you 
Let love flow in your veins 
I was crying on the night that I saw her 
Fell in love on that very same day 
I was desperately in need for her feelings 
I will strive for her heart till the endYou're hiding behind the face of your victims
An imitation of the ones you killed
Afraid
To see yourself in the mirror the mirror lies
Afraid
To be yourself in real life
Bastard  Coward
I've blackened my inner self of innocence
And it's tearing my soul apart
I'm abused
Misused
Confused
And I died mentally
Am I what you call insane
My mind decayed with hate I lost my common sense
Thus cannot tell right from wrong
Revenge
To avenge with a relentless killing spree
I cannot be saved no more
This childhood of mine betrayed
My sanity fades away while sowing my seeds of hate
Now tell me who's to blame
I'm afraid to be
And afraid to see to live my life as myself so a
Chameleon of life I'll be
I'll escape and be someone else
Memories from the past keep haunting me
All visions of guilt and shame that will make me cry
Even make me kill
And hide my face from you
Afraid
To see yourself in the mirror
It lies
It defies
To unleash your demise
You can't control year after year
Embrace oblivion with fear and weep and bleed and fall down
Paradise
Perfect creation of mankind
Welcome to paradise
Welcome to addiction depression corrosion affliction
correction repression relapsing collapsing
Into the abyss of progression
Together we create despair and guilt and anger
Justify
We should justify our crimes
Ignore the shore of sympathy
I die
The weight of the world keeps you in fear
You confine yourself in agony
And condemn yourself to misery
More and more you turn into yourself
No one can prevent this tragedy
Confined in yourself
Confined in pain
Confined in agony and shame
Condemned to misery
Prevent this tragedy
Welcome to the perfect creations of the human race
Injustice ignorance prejudice oppression to name but a few
As an individual we just have to justify all crimes
And ignore our own conscience to fit perfectly in this society
The mourning after
To oblivion we fade the morning after we fail to wake
My child
To oblivion we fade the morning after we sail away
And the crowd weeps
A magician with powers so strange resurrected from the past
He changed dust into flesh so not to rest eternally
See
What is dust
Death
Or youth for life
Onwards your spell drew it
Eyes will seek for you trust a secret
faith in the unknown ancient melancholic times
Where the mist was the old the weak are silenced
Like the folks that ran away after years
Never play with the raising of the dead
Powerful minds will overtake yours
Do not call up that which you can't put down
Memorize the words of the descending node
I'm climbing down now it's dark in here
I hear the moaning now
I'm going back again to the cellar stairs
I hear the moans again
This time I hide my fear
I climb down deep and find the answers here
Embrace the darkness
Imagine a land of milk and honey
You've been there in your dreams but it exists
There is no shame only love and joy
And lust will be satisfied in ecstasy
Flowers fill the hills of equality
The fragrance of roses caresses the air
Visions of Eden delights your inner child
So take my hand I'll take you there
In delight we could dwell forever more
To cherish the sea of magic dreams
To eat the fruits of joyous temptation
And bite into the shining apple green
This Garden of Eden where mist engulfs the mind
Where gods dwell to ease their sorrowed souls
Paradise in my hand unifies all delight
Together for eternity on borrowed time take me
Let your soul float into the mystic
scarlet regions awaiting in your dreams
Embrace the flowers of fulfillment
which the prophecy foretells
Listen to the oracle of light
and chant the verses of the cold sun
Into the void of a blackness you despise
I throw your sanity in the pit of your demise
Your mind is losing all grip on reality
My game has begun now you will suffer just like me
Your vision has been blinded by the guilt in your own soul
Your hearing is mistreated by your own screams while I laugh
Feelings have been blunted by what you have done to me
Time for my revenge has come the last day you will be
Oblivion will attach to you when you lose the grip on yourself
Without anything to look forward to because you're blind as of
now
But I can see you clearly can hear you screaming inside your
skull
And it pleases me it feeds me my goal is in sight
My name's Mr Conscience and I have destroyed your life
You think I'm a poltergeist but I'm only in your mind
You've become a vegetable drooling in your bed
I think you have paid the price so I'll let you die instead
Why does this journey end in the unknown
That's when you realize you had to die like me
Through the wasted years and all bitter times
The druid came to heal all our crimes
As long as we're surviving he shall conquer us all
In the book of ancient magic and light
The ancients will obtain the knowledge of their might
To heal the tortured souls their ultimate goal
Angels of mercy in disguise
Save tortured souls
Freedom is their goal
Onwards they dwell
Druid a winning streak
Ancients doom is in your hands
If you want to see the day
The reward is to travel through the skies in times to come
Then it will be you who lives
In the beginning I read the signs of decay
I was not to know what would come over me today
At the arrival of the train my body arrived
It could have been me and my mind was revived
The key of solutions is right in my hand
I've seen the tomb in which that urn stands
My coming days are ruled by death
Maria why these veils of blood
Or am I of that little faith
As I struggled through the corridors of my overactive
imagination or paranoia as some might say
the ultimate truth overwhelmed me
Like a fly in a web she had trapped me
I am doomeddoomed
Unknown paths of the mind glooming spheres of consciousness
reveal the second face of your life
When you please the soul you'll be unfolded
but serenity is lost
as you fall into confusion of your mind
Dusk you'll see
Sail the sea of dreams
Vision immortality escape the destiny of your real life
Would you like to be drowned in sleep forever
Join me and stay then darkness will remain
and drain your consciousness
Then you'll see the world from beyond
coward solution easy way out
Real life ignored
fantasy taking over now
Mirror the past
get a life or wake up dead
What do you fear
is it your mind or life you dread
I think it's you
The sea of dreams its currents take you from the shores of
existence
Fail and dream
Fail
Hunting for living anomalies to gather
your life's work a collection of beings of all ages
Your destiny is to create the ultimate zoo of life
Your only companions are your specimens
Travelling through the spheres of unknown dimensions
Druid of the future please take me with you
Exercise the right to choose what you collect and classify
Collector take me with you
Endless waves roll by lost in the tide of time
Freezing emotions hold my mind
Chained by the shadows inside
Try to remember can't forget
all my life just seems in vain
Even the sun has left
Taking me down in an abyss
only have myself to blame
Having no regret
Candles burning shining bright
Helping me through the night
Soon another morning comes to clear me up inside
And I try
All my troubles all my tensions
Make a new start make it happen now
Darkness fades as clouds roll by
The sunlight bursts the sky
Cleans my body frees my soul
only had myself to blame
Leaving it all behind
Afraid of the world I weep in my fear
I mourn for unbelievers
Damned for life they'll be
A journey of my major decline
Minor of joy tears to dry
Being fearless is life's fantasy
So I'll be a victim of fearThe road was long 
We travelled for months 
Always by your side
Never faltering 
We had our mission
No rest for the weak 
We bled with you fought with you we would have died with you 
We bled with you fought with you we would have died with you 
You turned your back on us
You left us behind 
As your ashes fall through our fingers 
We will show you
Everything you could have had
Weep while you will
This kingdom is ours 
Weep while you will 
This kingdom is ours
All we wanted was the truth 
Not the lies you hid behind 
Every poor reason a reminder 
How you let us down 
Your greed took hold of you
For that you will always pay
For your selfish mistakes
And you think you are happy 
We thought we were lost 
With sunken hearts we turned back 
To the home we forgot
On the path was a man 
His beard full 
With a smile on his face 
Who was this man 
This man was our savior 
We bled with you fought with you we would have died with you 
We bled with you fought with you we would have died with you 
You turned your back on us
You left us behind 
As your ashes fall through our fingers 
We will show you
Everything you could have had
Weep while you will
This kingdom is ours 
Weep while you will 
This kingdom is ours
We now stand on our own 
Stronger now then ever 
We continue our crusade 
This kingdom is ours
I left my family in their graves 
My mother My father 
All of them 
I walked off into the setting sun
Eyes set on tomorrow 
A future 
I had already stayed too long
Waiting for a sign 
A savior 
In my hands I took my fate 
My fears my memories 
Everything
Left behind in a dead place 
Living alone without a trace 
I had no idea 
I was lost with the dead 
How did I come out alive
How did I come out alive
Left behind in a dead place 
Living alone without a trace 
I had no idea 
I was lost with the dead 
How did I come out alive
How did I come out alive
A virgin to the world 
But I held no innocence 
I held the air of apathy 
I was the advent of apathy 
I was the advent of apathy
I am a shepherd with no sheep 
I am a man with no past 
I am a shepherd with no sheep 
I am a man with no past 
I am a shepherd with no sheep 
I am a man with no path
I am a shepherd with no sheep 
I am a man with no path
I chose no past 
With no stories to tell 
No one wants to hear 
Of death and dying 
I chose no past 
With no stories to tell 
No one wants to hear 
Of hell
I saw the fire you set 
I saw them all screaming
The flame turned everything to ash 
Every last one of them gone 
If nothing else you did your deed well 
Did your deed well 
I saw the families
Struggle through all the pain
But they won t ever forget 
That dark day you caused 
They can never forget 
They will never forget 
If nothing else you did your deed well 
Did your deed well 
You have no where to run
I ll take your fucking life 
I will destroy everything you know 
Set balance back to this world
If nothing else I ll do my deed well
Do my deed well 
There is wicked in this world 
I see it every day 
All cowards and thieves alike 
Another name off my list 
I am not the reaper 
But you are in my sights 
Everyone must pay 
For what is not theirs 
I am not the reaper
I am the avenger 
I am judge and jury 
I am the avenger 
Here to take all that is wrong 
And set it right 
I am judge and jury 
This is my duty 
My blessing my curse
I am the avenger 
I will take what is wrong 
And set it right 
I am judge and jury 
This is my duty 
This is my blessing 
My curse 
I am the balance 
I am the fucking balance
This world would fall without me 
I am the fucking balance
This world would fall without me 
I am the fucking balance
This world would fall without me 
I am the fucking balance
This world would fall without meTake a step back  try to
Remember what you believe in
What drives you to be who you are
Why cover it up  deny it
Embrace the aspirations
Look forward to a new beginning
Swallowed up by your desolation
Consumed by an infestation
Temptation
Choked at the peak of my arbitration
Constant selfish visions
My mind is filled with filth
I've been down in the circles of Hell
Been crushed by the weight of the world
Three years I have been asleep asleep
A flesh prison trapped inside of me
I am the reason you are so angry
I am the reason you won't succeed
I have the weight of the world
On my shoulders
So much that I can
Hardly bare it
Stop breathing down my neck  lurking
Time to rid myself of this sick disease
 free myself from this horrid feeling
My mind's in a cage
Screaming to be let free
I will overcome
Anything  everything
That stands in my way 
No one
No one can hold me back
Illusions in my head
Cowering from my awakening
I am free from this painNo lights shine from these curtained windows No moon through these clouds There they lie unaware of these watchful eyes
A childhood killed before it began A royal family left with just one son What has this act of violence created
The axe has fallen Just two strikes The future holds so much As blood fills their mouths I rise
Footsteps down a frozen hallway A sick noise shakes a child awake Ceiling leaks read rain Crawls out into an evil realm From the threshold sharpened metal silver Hiding behind maroon blinds Young eyes
As blood fills their mouths I rise
What's this A survivor Oh he's but a boy Enjoy your shitty life I know your brother will
So scared crawl upstairs to where my nightmares breed find my parents dead love is dead Night's moon as bright as his axe that night
Oh dear brother please Forgive our beloved father for promising me happiness and health but removing you from home to survive on your own You went against his values and his love but he was our father the same Help me find who ended our family
Find someone for me Make sure he is strong
Perform this job for me In turn for him You will never get close to the killer You are a runt like father Pathetic and weak Don't return until it is done
Sent out empty to cold wet streets Hunting a man I don't yet know Is his sentence just or am I as vile as my enemy I never wish to know this man Only to discover the destroyer of my world Interrogating Hiding Stalking My prey is closer every passing minute
A bludgeoned greeting The gift of a duct tape jacket For it's a cold walk to the dump tonight where your remains will equal the garbage
What will I become for this This is not a road I dreamt to take Would my creators judge me I can not do this I will not do this I can not   
The moonlight's flash on my victim's frames triggers the site in my mind of the tool of my parent's demise This fucking scum is nothing more or less than the killer to me Inch by inch his face caves in My hand the molder of flesh and bone Your end was not worthless my friend You will be joined by whom I seek
So soon my artwork is appreciated by works of a similar medium I find myself in a dark place on a street I never knew Only the finest eat here Sir My admirer sits
Could this be him A face so young So bold So true An artist with an equal darkness A voice in his head that tells him of evil
I saw your work oh protege Though I was the only one Your attack was well planned but chaotic with no doubt Come work for me for there is no better opportunity in town Do me this contract and watch yourself rise
At last the moment has come to make a name for myself A shroud A cloud To travel in behind my victim's heart I accept
I've finally fucking got you Too much time spent waiting No one will convict you of your crimes And so I'm here to deliver your justice You think that you could run forever I'm sick of sitting down you're done The courts may buy your bullshit Tossing your case out with ease Although there's no formal evidence
I know of all your deeds And I drink these nights away Praying to God that I may Find you in a situation like the one we're in now Time to die you fuck
Kudos
Here it is This will make or break you Within these pages you find a man A man who may have betrayed us A betrayal to me is a betrayal to you Do not fret and do not fear I have seen your craft You will impress
In the wild once again The tail of a man none the wiser of what will be Darkness approaching Secrets uncovered and lies revealed Opposing motives for solitary gain
Sir here's the man stealing from your riches
Let me go
Listen to him plead plead plead
No
No no no You do not speak You just listen You think I do not know who you are or what you do You are the filthy slithering swine of this organization If you had a heart I would rip it from your chest and I would make you swallow it whole I will spew the evil from your guts I want you to know that I am going to your house tonight and I will slit the throats of your family while they sleep You will not have a chance to be missed They will never know you're gone
Allow me sir Please I will rid this rat from your world
No I've something just for him A blade sharp and still stained with blood of old Allow me
Wearing a new shade of red Mind far behind the eyes A final display of punishment Lines his ducks in a row
Remove this filth from my sight Heed this though young man No one may know Do not be seen Do not be heard Do not be felt
In over my head again The weight of a man on my shoulders This shroud of darkness could not be thick enough What do I do Burned buried or diced Discretely erasing a life The snap of a twig The blast of a gun Two dead a man and a woman lie before my feet Witness Innocence What have I done to this man and this woman Am I now the same as him One becomes three Three bodies in the quarry What have I done Neglect to check my work Erase my tracks Reckless
Oh dear brother I found him Your associate my employer our neighbor He is the killer He ended our father's reign Rising to this city's throne With your inherited power we must cause his fall
How could you be so blind I thought you would have been on my side Maybe I guess just not this time How could you be so blind I gave them both enough time to share what should have been mine All mine I threw him where you can not find him I can't believe I did this to him but I had to What can I say What do I do now
Dad was right to cast you out Your greed and hatred infested from the start Now I know the origin of your strength and gold You disgust me How dare you sit in his chair in this tower in this room I am finished with your existence
Another bullet from my scythe Another piece of family lost
Could I have been a fool Trusted too soon I fear I have been discovered
A second class member buried in distrust Falling behind in my mutinous scheme Excuse me Boss I'll be back soon Someone close behind Mind bent on destruction Following Heart racing A stranger Gun pulled Aiming at my goal A shot A shout The stranger falls down My prey still stands My gun warm From outcast to savior
Come Boy and you shall see the proper ways of this craft You threw three bodies from a dock Seek deeper waters and make sure they will not float Not even fisherman's nets will find the mass graves you leave for this Earth
I beseech Don't allow your defenses to be breached No lights No noise This is a job for the dead of night
Cut them into pieces Throw them overboard One bag at a time Meet the ocean floor
Now you are a cog in the machine Now you are the silent killer this world needs
We send our sins to sink The sea swallows them whole
Set them free
This is the circle of life The unfortunate truth for those of us in this business Survival of the fittest and we are the strongest ones
Thieves sink Liars sink Bastards sink Traitors sink Never underestimate the power of your will You can commit so much violence if you just put your mind to it Try it Now you know what to do next time The art of your life and this is your masterpiece
In a dormant mind Come on come on give me hope to dehumanize creating prized possessions in my mind I know getting injured hold my grip on vengeance is in key of darker fall Blood closure Closure in my mind
Odds stacked against me at the family gathering Odds stacked against me in my revenge
Paranoia I fear my defenses have been breached An old friend has perished And I think I know why
Infiltration Discretion Killer with an invitation Chameleon
A party A remembrance Let us honor him I hope I am the only one who knows his dark past Forgive me Father for I have sinned
Familiar environment Hire foolish men Distractions His deadly heirloom is rightfully mine and will sever him limb from limb His deadly heirloom in rightfully mine and so is my revenge
Up the stairs Through the threshold Eying every villain Weighing my decisions Told I'm requested for private counsel
Come in You have shown me true respect You have earned this prize for your allegiance My eyes are open from this tragedy This man was my friend I could perish at any moment I want you to have my empire when I'm dead Will you accept
A fight breaks below You are finished Through This empire is mine Not for you One fatal mistake The child you passed That was me You should never have come to that home that night
What is this A final betrayal Who are you
I am your pupil I am your wealth I am your nightmare I am my father's son
As blood fills my mouth I fall
Full throttle speed ahead
Punish the roaring engine
Burnt rubber the scent of lead
Fast down the highway
Flames feed on gasoline
Bone crushing heavy pressure
Tight left adrenaline
I'm on my way
Oil as blood under the hood
Pumping freely through
I live behind the wheel
The dusty grey keeps calling me
So I drive through the night
Another city another scene
Straight ahead aimlessly
The open road is my bride
This is life on the fast lane
Sparks fly dynamite
Bullet on wheels explosive
Hit the gas tight right
And on I go
Black leather paint glows red
Horny pair of legs beside me
Speed junkie piston head
And on I go
Oil as blood under the hood
pumping freely through
I live behind the wheel
The dusty grey keeps calling me
So I drive through the night
Another city another scene
Straight ahead aimlessly
The open road is my bride
This is life on the fast lane
Let's celebrate this suffering
While the grave is still warm
We've got no time to lose
Let's set fire on everything In
honor of flame to be gone
We've got nothing to lose
Kiss before the fall
Hearts beating fast
Let's make the moment last for
tomorrow''a doom is already gleaming
It's gone so fast
Let go forgive the past for the
mercury of life keeps falling
falling down
Let's enjoy this suffering
disillusioned and free
We've still got time to choose
Let's desire everything
the name of extinction to be
We've got us to abuse
Kiss before the fall
Hearts beating fast
Let's make the moment last for
tomorrow''a doom is already gleaming
It's gone so fast
Let go forgive the past for the
mercury of life keeps falling
falling down
I fill the chamber bullet by bullet
Hoping this time it won't jam
To play a round of the northern roulette
and leave this world with a bang
Just on squeeze and all will cease
One for the gun to drown the last line of defense
I'm ready for hell
I'm so sick of it all
With a vengeance I have hated
I hear them crows call
For the death black wings I've waited
To come and peck the flesh off of my bones
I oil the rope to be sure the knot slides
Tie down the other end tight
Stand on a chair and close my eyes
Knowing this it's alright
A step just one and all is done
One for the rope to drown the last line of defense
I'm ready for hell
I'm so sick of it all
With a vengeance I have hated
I hear them crows call
For the death black wings I've waited
They're hovering close
Oh so close
They've come to drag me down to the unknown
Let them peck the flesh off of my bones
I'm so sick of it all
With a vengeance I have hated
I hear them crows call
For the death black wings I've waited
They're hovering close
 Oh so close
They've come to drag me down to the unknown
They're close oh so close
Won't need no coroner to tag my toe
Let them peck the flesh off of my bones
Through the sixfeet of dirt they
claim to hear the sound of the pouring rain
Saying it's me up here pissing on your grave
The stench of shit gathers more of flies to run
their mouths
Them brainless know not
what they're talking about
It's the outcome of severe inbreeding
Back then now and always
you maggots will be crawling by my side
Keeping the flame of hate alive
Until the hell freezes over I will
be the cold thorn right there in your side
I promise you rain tonight
From behind them aliases
pathetically trying to point their gun
To me it's none for all and all for none
It must be hard without them brain cells
to try and understand
With empty pigasseyes to make a stand
Hooray for the severe inbreeding
Back then now and always
you maggots will be crawling by my side
Keeping the flame of hate alive
Until the hell freezes over I will
be the cold thorn right there in your side
I promise you rain tonight
This is where it ends
I can't have the years wasted back
Reinvent something I've lost how to feel
The table is set for three
Indifference you and me and we
sit there in silence
Don't care to speak
It's not temporary
It's our cemetery
And we are carved in stone
From nowhere to nowhere
Oblivion approaches
I've said my piece want nothing from you
From bitter to worse
Oh so revengefully yours
We've done our time  Just let us go
This is where it ends
I'm getting the hell out of here
Leaving nothing behind  It was never real
The hole is dug for three
Suffering you and me and we
lay there in silence
 No need to speak
It's finally here  No anguish no fear
And we are free at last
From nowhere to nowhere
Oblivion approaches
I've said my piece want nothing from you
I love you
I hate you
I'll sing when you're dead
I loathe you
I need you
I'll scream and regret
From nowhere to nowhere
Oblivion approaches
I've said my piece want nothing from you
From bitter to worse
Oh so revengefully yours
We've done our time  Just let us go
So you thought you had it made
All on that shining silver plate
Now you're turning a brand new page
Not a word disappearing without a trace
You've spawned just rage
Have a nice rest of your life for
it's all you've got
Until it rains ice in hell
the shit will keep on rolling out your mouth
No more of you  It's zero tolerance
Can you hear the final bell it 
tolls for you that there is no doubt
We are through now  This is where it ends
Black is whiteRed is green
Spit it out Say what you mean
Trust is earned not ingratiated
The bridge is burned the past contaminated
Annihilated
Better to be hated for what you are
than loved for what you're not
Until it rains ice in hell
the shit will keep on rolling out your mouth
No more of you  It's zero tolerance
Can you hear the final bell it
tolls for you that there is no doubt
We are through now  This is where it ends
Flowers in bloom
It's a beautiful day
Headed for doom
Destruction and decay
Stare at the sun
the warm rays of light
Nowhere to run
We've already lost the fight
Hand in hand we wait this all to end
Everything dies  Withers away
There's no afterlife
No nothing's here to stay
Hope is a lie
we in vain beg and pray
While floating down the deadend stream until it's time
to drown away
Life is so sweet
So seize the day
Destiny's sealed
And soon to pine away
Enjoy while you can
Breathe in breathe out
Try and understand the only way is out
Gun in hand we wait this all to end
Everything dies  Withers away
There's no afterlife
No nothing's here to stay
Hope is a lie
we in vain beg and pray
While floating down the deadend stream until it's time
No one gets out of here alive 
No one comes back to testify
So enjoy while you can my child
We only got this one time
Everything dies  Withers away
There's no afterlife
No nothing's here to stay
Hope is a lie
we in vain beg and pray
While floating down the deadend stream until it's time
Still too much I recall of them
gnawed out bones which the
mattock of time buried beneath
the pavement
And to wade in the shades won't clear the air
won't erase the stench of them dead
Will the solace be found from 
the north of the ditch
Dug deep with my own beaten shovel
For sure it is not in the notes of the selfpity moan
Could it be at the end of the double barrel
The time is nigh
Until the end I'll deny that there's sense in this life
I am what I am a futile man
And till the end I'll deny that there's meaning behind
I am what I am a futile man
Now hear my child this weight will land on your shoulders
You too will pay this debt of despair
I'm not here to teach you or to show you the way
It wouldn't make any difference
The time is nigh
Until the end I'll deny that there's meaning behind
I am what I am a futile man
And till the end I'll deny that there's sense in this life
I am what I am a futile man
Still too much I recall of them
gnawed out bones which the
mattock of time buried beneath
the pavement
And to wade in the shades won't clear the air
won't erase the stench of them dead
Until the end I'll deny that there's sense in this life
I am what I am a futile man
And till the end I'll deny that there's meaning behind
I am what I am a futile man
Down this road again and it feels like beneath
the dust of time
Down this road once again and it seems this will be until
the end of my time
Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me
Along this road once again
still it seems like it leads nowhere but away
Along this road once again
still it seems that it has been always this way
Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me
Scars are made to remind
Oh how I wish you were here
to make the sighs of despair disappear
Oh how I wish you could see
in spite of it all what you mean to me
And oh how these years have been long
while humming the notes of the dead man's song
Oh how I wish they would fade
all of them wounds I know it's too late
Scars are made to remind
Left wading neckhigh in dirt
by the flood of wastewaters
Completely soaked to the bone
Floating restless in time pining out
Through the unending struggles
Straight towards the unknown with nothing to hold onto
Always against the stream
Beating through debris
But as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
Always against the stream
Riding on the belief
That as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
Left sailing the sea of dirt
on a raft that is leaking
Moved by the stench of the wind
Waiting the hightide to come
to finally sink in
In the scumtsunami with nothing to hold onto
Always against the stream
Beating through debris
But as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
Always against the stream
Riding on the belief
That as long as the scenery keeps changing
it's alright
At the age of sixteen
I grew out of hope
I regarded the cosmos
Through a circle of rope
So I threw out my plans
Ran on to the wheel
And emptied my head
Of all childish ideals
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
I married the first girl
Who wasn't a man
And smiled as the spiders
Ran all over my hands
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
Made a good living
By dying it's true
As the world in my TV
Leaked onto my shoes
The sleep of no feeling
Sleep of no being
Sleep of no dreaming
Sleep of no dreaming
Waiting to be born again
Wanting the saddest kind of pain
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away
Nothing is what I feel
Waiting for the drugs to make it real
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away
Waiting to be disciplined
Aching for your nails across my skin
Waiting for the day when I will crawl away
Telepath Carbon trapped under stone
Brother mother pale body is thrown
Only way I know to have fun
Fill up my blood my veins my lungs
ESP city  rainy and blue
Burn down this town I give it to you
Aero shallow photograph blind
Stage fright black light coma divine
No sense of time
Sever tomorrow
Exitless mind  ESP Sever tomorrow
School out invective losing my voice
Film shredding on in multiple choice
America calls I must go
Oprah saviour I feel that low
Modem load and failsafe
Electric teenage dust
Hit the solvent keypad
Start the neural rust
Power on the highway
Data in my head
Surfing on the network
Part of me is dead
Every Home is Wired
Swimming in the circuit
Somebody has expired
This world will be the future
Every home is wired
Inside the vehicle the cold is extreme
Smoke in my throat kicks me out of my dream
I try to relax but its warmer outside
I fail to connect it's a tragic divide
This has become a full time career
To die young would take only 21 years
Gun down a school or blow up a car
The media circus will make you a star
Dark matter flowing out on to a tape
Is only as loud as the silence it breaks
Most things decay in a matter of days
The product is sold the memory fades
Crushed like a rose
In the river flow
I am I know
I made it up
It's complicated
I gave up
On giving it a name
Things are implied
Nothing's the same
Worried I won't remember where to begin
I wish this would end
What will it take for us
What will it take for us
What will it take for us to
If you pray for us
Pray for love
It might just save us from
It just might
I made too much
Overrated
I gave too much
As if there was something to gain
Things are implied
Nothing's the same
Worried I won't remember where to begin
We must decide
If you pray for us
Pray for love
It might just save us from
It might just save us from
It just might
Wish us godspeed
Oh please whatever it might be
Tell it about the way it is
When I found the point of life
It came creeping towards me
In the shape of I
It was all this reimagined
It was a different kind of speech
It was repetition
It was what you wanted to be
When I saw the shape of sound
Everything came spiralling
It was all this reimagined
It was a different kind of speech
It was repetition
It was what you wanted to be
Oh come find
This caged me
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe in
Breathe in
Once you found the breath you'd lost
Breathe again
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe in
Breathe in
Once you found the breath you'd lost
Breathe again
It was all this reimagined
It was a different kind of speech
It was repetition
And I am exactly what you imagined me to be
You'd rather be in the dark than know what we know
It's easier than to deal with illusions of pleasure
It's easier
What's the price of it
What's the price to live
We're only killing ourselves each and every day
Despite what we believe
There's a difference between what is and what else the perceiver knows
The only colors they know and for these things they can't compose
'Cause they don't know what I know
They'll sell your souls for their gold
And that's far too much for you
I'd tell you these words but I'll hold them
And some say you already know
You're clairvoyant
What's the price of it
If we kill ourselves a little bit
Is it worth it
Start is relative to end
This has no price attached to it
What's the price of it
Fall down
Fall down
Since this began
I've misplaced my head
This all seems so nauseating
Does it
Just let me sleep
Just let me
Until I feel free
I can feel it sinking in
Until I feel free
I can feel it sinking in
If you wish me anything
Just wish me sleep
Just wish me
Until I feel free
I can feel it sinking in
I can feel it sinking in
I feel a sinking feeling
Just let me sleep
Just let me
Do you hear me know
Am I thinking loud
I don't want to come down
I'm too proud
Until I feel free
I can feel it sinking in
I feel a sinking feeling
Just let me sleep
Just let me sleep
Just let me
Do you see what I see
Do you see what I see now
Do you see what I see
Do you see what I see now
All mixed up turned around
What are you thinking about
What were we talking about now
Emotionfree euphoric state
Too little too late
You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away
Well let's be honest
You don't have that much faith
I think it's too late if you're looking to save face
I see you slipping from that throne of grace
Focused on opening up
You're thinking too loud
All this comes as the comedown
At least you can say you tried to pray for them
You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away
Well let's be honest
You don't have that much faith
I think it's too late if you're looking to save face
I see you slipping from that throne of grace
Why do we ask for these selfish ways
Are we the only ones that need saving
I think we were foolish in thought
Then again I'm probably wrong
I'm probably wrong
You pray for rain in hopes that it'll wash away
Well let's be honest
You don't have that much faith
I think it's too late if you're looking to save face
I see you slipping from that throne of grace
Noises noises
Are all I hear when you speak
The point of it all left much faster than it crept to me
If the relapse happens today
Then let tomorrow be recovery
All that you've been sold is fool's gold
Predictable in nature so it seems
They've clairvoyant
They created your dependency
They're clairvoyant
If the relapse happens today
Then let tomorrow be recovery
All that you've been sold
Fool's gold all
It's as if they already know all
It's as if they already know
They're clairvoyant
They're clairvoyant
Stuck in the lines that they prescribe
This can't be what we need
Recommended daily for dependency
Best of luck with your recovery
If the relapse happens today
Then let tomorrow be recovery
All that you've been sold
Fool's gold all
It's as if they already know all
It's as if they already know
Return to the earth
Rain on black clouds
Return to the earth
Return to the earth
Wasn't technically perfect
Could it have been any better
Was the fall worth it
I don't feel any better
And you were so sick
You were skin and bones
So you fed yourself excuses
Just to keep it going
Nodding on and on
Nodding on and on
Raining on and on
Raining on and on
So keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Like a ghost sinking into the ground
Keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Now that all these black clouds
Keep on raining down
Wasn't technically perfect
Could it have been any better
Falling faster and faster
Do you still feel clever
Couldn't stop the momentum
Couldn't stop you from crashing
Wish that I had seen it coming
And you were so sick
You were skin and bones
So you fed yourself excuses
Just to keep it going
Nodding on and on
Nodding on and on
Nodding on and on
Raining on and on
Raining on and on
So keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Do you remember what was said
You could lose the sleep
All of those nauseous things
I'll have you know
It didn't take long
I'd bring you back to Earth
Return to the earth
And if you come down
Return to the earth
So keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Like a ghost sinking into the ground
Keep on slipping 'til the end of the earth
Now that all these black clouds
Keep on raining
Breathe in
Sink in
I bet you couldn't sleep
I bet you couldn't see with the tunnel vision that you had
Keeps on raining
Keeps on raining
I bet you couldn't breathe
I bet you couldn't breathe when your lungs collapsed
Keeps on raining
Keeps on raining
I know you felt alone
I know you felt it in your bones
I could feel it in my teeth
I know you couldn't sleep
If only you would find your mind
Worried I can't remember where to begin
Misplaced my mind presupposition
But you didn't know what you should've done
Maybe I shouldn't have had another one
Maybe I'm just desperate to think you'd be fine after you lost your mother
I guess that I thought that you'd be alright
Are you alright
I wish you the best
I wish you godspeed
I wish you the rest
And now you can sleep
They say that life goes on
Can't imagine how you missed her
But tell me where have you gone
Where was I when you called home
It's just not that easy when all that's left is just all your bonesCultivate a war breed
Get the head your soul needs
Crystallize at light speed
Dis the lies that they feed
Cultivate a war breed
Get the head your soul needs
Crystallize at light speed
Dis the lies that they feed that they feed
We're burning out of control
We're burning out of control
We're burning out of control
We're burning out of control
War a state of mind
War our hearts are blind
War is nature dead
War war
Holy war tears of man
Drop your front baby obey the command
Holy war tears of man
Drop your front baby obey my command
Split the lip that dope feeds
Exterminate the bad seed
Tread the path that monks breathe
Ride the horse that runs free that runs free
We're burning out of control
We're burning out of control
We're burning out of control
We're burning out of control
War a state of mind
War our hearts are blind
War is nature dead
War war
Holy war tears of man
Drop your front baby obey the command
Holy war tears of man
Drop your front baby obey my command
Lies drugs hate guns God fear flies sex
Lies drugs hate guns God fear flies sex
We're burning out of control

We're burning out of control
We're burning out of control
War a state of mind
War our hearts are blind
War is nature dead
War war
Holy war tears of man
Drop your front baby obey the command
Holy war tears of man
Drop your front baby obey my command
Hail the guitar all tuned down
In a power circle obey the crowd
All ride a wave crash right in
Lovers and fighters adrenaline
The singer spits our hearts all rise
Energy is visible we all crush tight
All washed away tsunami wave
Fragile human all the same
And now I face the sound
When all around is burning
I'm like Hermes drifting down
I am the saint your path into the light
I am the knife that cuts right through your life
I have found the path immortalized
I am the saint the path into the light
Caught in a trap the systems are down
Communication's broken I feel underground
Weight of the storm in sound we all drown
You'll never understand what drives us all on
And now I face the sound
And all around is burning
I'm like Hermes drifting down down down down
I am the saint your path the way the light
I am the knife that cuts right through your life
I have found the path immortalized
I am the saint your path the way the light
I am the saint your path into the light
I am the knife that cuts right through your life
I have found the path immortalized
I am the saint your path the way the light
I am the saint
You love it you need it
You taste it and you'd breathe it
You want it you feel it
You gotta receive it
You hate it can't leave it
You shoot it you cheat it

Her voice is a beatin' down she pushes through the crowd
And kisses me on the mouth and her name is ah Libertine
Libertine and I can't quite control myself
Libertine and I can't quite control myself
Libertine and I can't quite control myself
Libertine and I can't quite control myself
All my friends are at the feast angry righteous free
Fightin' the disease violence against the seed
Her voice is a beatin' down for time and around the crowd
She kisses me on the mouth and her name is ah Libertine ooh
Libertine and I can't quite control myself

Libertine and I can't quite control myself
Libertine Libertine aw Libertine LibertineI have returned
to destroy you all
you will all become my slaves
as I burn earth to the ground
you will feel my wrath
You feel your flesh
being burned off
Born in the flames of sodom
I feel no pain
you will all bow before me
or be put to death
I will scortch all your land
and rape your women
you will pray
but your god will not show
I will be your leader now
my army will grow
as your world is swallowed in fire
your life will soon come to an end
I will being death
I will bring tears
there will be no mercy
your preachers taught you to dispise me
even they will be put on their knees
begging for their lives
as I will be cutting off their heads
setting their bodies ablaze
I have come for genocide
you will all die
as your world crumbles
there will be nothing left
Setting your world on fire
burning your churches down
you will soon see
Setting your world on fire
burning your churches down
you will soon see
you were all wrong
Bring forth the nazarene
here charged with heresy
his chosen people chanting death
this false messiah
self proclaimed king
violating roman law his lying tongue will be brought to an end
he shall suffer
his god no where in sight
he shall suffer
no more time for miracles the time to die is here
forsaken bastard son
the mob cries out for blood
his chosen people chanting death
abandoned weakling
cries out in pain
crown of thorns placed on his brow will begin the bloodshed
he shall suffer
his god no where in sight
he shall suffer
no more time for miracles the time to die is here
torturing
thrashing whip
breaking bones
ripping skin
whimpering
to his god
march him to the hill
at last the time to kill
hammering
into the flesh
pounding nails
with violence
hands and feet
into the wood
soak the ground with his blood
staring at his whore
watch as the blood pours
now he dies
hear his mother's cries
now he dies
slaughter complete
all will suffer
their god no where in sight
there will be no resurrection
followers will spread lies
lies
Screams fall silent as you are taken from earth
the darkness consumes my soul
as the blood splatters all through the room
your eyes will soon close
death approachs as your life is drained from you
insides falling out onto the floor
watching your life end as i become erect
I must kill more to feed my addiction for the dead
the pungeant oder from the decay stiffens my head
waiting to slaughter again so I can release my load
cutting out the heart so my member can expload
the stonger the stench the more cum I release
the bodies build up but my mind will not ease
every cut makes my blood start to flow
my phallus slowly begins to grow
my next victim will be the same as the others
stalked in the night and cut deep in the throat
my urge to kill grows day by day
my dick grows in anticipation
as I see my next contestant I feel it get hard
I lose control and slice waiting for the blood to flow
I must kill more to feed my addiction for the dead
the pungeant oder from the decay stiffens my head
waiting to slaughter again so I can release my load
cutting out the heart so my member can explode
The Anticipation of Death
Returning from the battlefield with those we have not slain
their eminent demise is not because they disobey
I have no need for subjagation gold or jewels or adoration
bringing home my prize of human meat
once the livestock has arrived they're prepared for my feast
deboned defleshed prepping my harvest
Herds of human cattle
marching 5 by 5
none who enter will ever leave alive
one slice begins the drain
my power strengthens from their pain
all forever more my existence shall remain
Every single drop of fluid drained into my cup
slurp until my stomach fills and sends it gushing up
no amount will satisfy I always long for more
bring my bodies filled with life
I only live to gorge
torsos bisected
nothing put to waste
entrails extracted
bones smashed into paste
I need the flesh
I need the blood
the bodies fill my moat
as the corpses pile up
they start their vile bloat
my never ending lust for death
the price for this my oath
eternal life for eating man
my contract with this goat
Herds of human cattle
marching 5 by 5
none who enter will ever leave alive
one slice begins the drain
my power strengthens from their pain
all forever more my existence shall remain
Nations have fallen to my hunger
my twisted mind ripping lives asunder
The fires of hell burning within my eyes
as I claim another sacrifice
population decreases
as each repost I crave deceases
scant remains lay on the ground
how may I repay the beast when nothing left to slaughter can be found
Long have I consumed this world
it's children I've devoured
the sanctity of human life
for centuries deflowered
now the well for lasting youth
For me will soon run dry
I'll feel the woe i sought to best
the deathless now must die
one thousand years have come and gone
no more remain to kill
but like the beast that owns my soul
I have not had my fill
My palate shaped by decadance
there's just one thing I'll eat
though I'm the final specimen
it must be human meat
Every single drop of fluid drained into my cup
slurp until my stomach fills and sends it gushing up
no amount will satisfy I always long for more
bring my bodies filled with life
I only live to gorge
Torsos bisected
nothing put to waste
entrails extracted
bones smashed into paste
Walking through the darkness
you will not hear me
I have come to disembowel you
Your insides are all I crave
I will cut you open
and take what is now mine
Your blood will pool on the ground
next to your lifeless body
Your screams roar into the night
soon you will be dead
You are the organ donor
and I will take them with force
Multiple Stab wounds to your chest
Before I rip your ribs apart
I put my treasures into my burlap sack
slowly taking your limbs
cutting off more and more
Your screams roar into the night
soon you will be dead
Your cunt will bleed
Looking for my next victim
wanting their blood spilled
I will desmember them with a slice from my knife
taking more body parts
I will kill more
Death again for another young whore
You will be the next organ donorDon't you live if you can't sacrifice
Don't you plead to someone for more time
Don't forget that people need to fight
And we can give them all they desire
You shouldn't run without a weapon
Without a fire
To keep alive in your hand
We will arrive to find a land to overwhelm
To chase the dark and choose to live forever
Don't you scream until you're bound to shoot
Of your abilities you give us proof
We expect you set the world on fire
No failure No compromise
You shouldn't run without a weapon
Without a fire
To keep alive in your hand
We will arrive to find a land to overwhelm
To chase the dark and choose to live forever
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Et interra Infernum
Gloria in excelsis Deo
Et in Terra Infernum laudamus te
Coming out into the night
Our barricades
Show the tragedy of outcasts
And no words to say
When the rebel sun sets behind the assembly line
All the humanoids are waiting for the
Next sunny day
And hours for passer byes
Are running faster and faster
Tomorrow's bringing on a brave new day
The man who claims to rule and teach
Is only master for the rich
And anyway succumbs
To the laws of nature in the end
And all the prophets on the streets
Meeting for tomorrow sleep
And hear the sound of sirens
In unison they cry
The sun and wind are a symphony
For the man who builds
And thirty years are soon left back
As progress steps forward
A crowd of outcasts
Protect their ignorance into the barricades
The man who claims to rule and teach
Is only master for the rich
And anyway succumbs
To the laws of nature in the end
And all the prophets on the streets
Meeting for tomorrow sleep
And hear the sound of sirens
In unison they stop
Got lost in a while
And later we left alright
We got back together
To destroy the night
We don't play for nothing
And nothing's left inside the grave
We needed to fly
From the rest of the world
Here's no heaven
And always and always feeling
Shame and failure
Forever and ever empty souls of nothing
And feeling a pleasant urge to fly
To fly away
Your mothers and fathers
Will point the finger on your choice
And make you belive
You're the same of the world
Here's no heaven
And always and always feeling
Shame and failure
Forever and ever empty souls of nothing
And feeling a pleasant urge to fly
To fly away
Here imprisoned in the fisrt world
A place full of lost souls
There's a ripped world for everyone
That's showing our feeling inside
Send me your soul
With a letter
To the second world
Send me your body
With a letter
For a second time
Then follow me on to
Gravitate
Like satellites and we
Try to recall
The old days of silence
Then we'll fall down
Like a cancer in my brain
Like a pain it's hard to tell
A silence that grows inside
Waiting for the world to come
Send me your soul
With a letter
To the second world
Send me your body
With a letter
For a second time
Then follow me on to
Gravitate
Like satellites and we
Try to recall
The old days of silence
Then we'll fall down
Someone lived a lie before the dawn of man
Some other lie in heaven hoping for a better cage
Our prison was a corridor of steel and gold
Our bad mistakes are running in a circle
And you can see the damned somebody sent in there
As I knew
And promises would not be kept again
And you can feel the guilt for not having saved this land
Once again
Your promises will let you be will let you be condemned
Lost in the labyrinth of words and blasphemy
We follow the wake of pioneers of chimneys
In the cold of long nights as they ring the bells reversing new hells
And towers of steel will rise above the city
And you can see the damned somebody sent in there
As I knew
And promises would not be kept again
And you can feel the guilt for not having saved this land
Once again
Your promises will let you be will let you be condemned
Frenzy in my heart
Every second is an earthquake
Cars and traffic lights
Someone racing after something
A rain of dust is in front of your eyes
Not far away from here the earth's breaking down
Sun of winter rain of dust
Whispering we call our last goodbye goodbye
Mounts of fire storm from the west
Desperate we call our last goodbye goodbye
All our plans and deals
All our memories in the pipeline
We cannot see it clear
'Cause the skyline don't belong to us
Not far away from here the earth's shaking more
Sun of winter rain of dust
Whispering we call our last goodbye goodbye
Mounts of fire storm from the west
Desperate we call our last goodbye goodbye
Absolve domine animas omnium
Fidelium defunctorum
Sleep with the nightmare of endless time
That runs more than you
And there's nothing to do
Playing with ghosts coming back home
Time pressure dictates
The rules of the games
Oh my reverie is a tyrant
A tyrant inside me
Leads my memories
And the future is scary like me
Oh my reverie
Is a future more scary than me
We fell asleep as we settled in the town
Helpless torn and painless
Before the journey we sat beside the fire
To speak our final promise
And I'm waiting
We are waiting
For the inner fate to save our life
The path was empty uncovered in the night
Stones were cold and flaming
But I'm waiting
We are waiting
For the inner fate to save our life
And in the name of the western homicide
We built our empire
Our sun was shining like crystal in the eyes
All around was faded
Now I'm fading
We are fading
Our inner fate destroyed our life
And I'm fading
We are fading
Our hidden fame destroyed our life
I get around
And find my limits
I feel the burden of my chains
The others said that I'm nothing but
At last I've lost my faith
There was a time when I was praying
Due to the uncertainty of my thoughts
Then tigers broke in my home through the walls
At last I've lost my faith
At last I've lost my faith
We're here waiting for you
The end that will be
No windows open for
Your church of agony
The word is for the prophets
The act is for the man
Praise for your miracles
We're coming your way
We're ready for a spirit
That's never falling down
In death someone's gonna pile
The ashes of time
117
et cum vidissem eum
cecidi ad pedes eius tamquam mortuus
et posuit dexteram suam super me dicens
noli timere
Friends of pain and fate
We're never immortal in the end
It's never late when misery comes
Tears of rage and hate
Are only a memory of the past
So don't despair our enemy's gone
Please don't hesitate
Our warlord leads to some promised land
To get repaired when misery comes
Kings and queens are dead
They're ashes just ashes in the air
Alone at last and definity lostI am a walking revival
Nothing will stand in my way
I am a walking revival
There will be hell to pay
Here comes the pain
Let's start a revolution
Let's call this fire down
Let's ignite this generation
Let's burn this building down
For every wall you building we're tearing it down
For every law you make we're breaking it now
You can't stop this
You can't stop us
If you play with fire you're gonna get burned
Let's set it on fire and watch it burn
And watch it burn
Put out the flames with gasoline and watch it burn
And watch it burn
For every wall you build we're tearing it down
For every law you make we're
we're breaking it now
I am a walking revival
I will burn your world to the ground
Wake up
I awake
Awake to see the living dead
They live in darkness too blind to see the path they've led
They search this world to try to find existence
They are the damned they chose their own extinction
Let the dead bury their own dead
Everyone is dead
Will you stand with this generation
Or will you watch it dig its own grave
We are the light in the dark the cure for your disease
We are the army of God you are the enemy
Won't close my eyes to a world that cannot see
Won't close my eyes to a world that won't believe
Awake 
Wake up this generation
Forgive me I have fallen away
I've been lost at sea trying to find my way
Trying to find my way back home
Back into your grace
So I look to the sky and pray for rain
One day the rain will come and wash away my pain
One day the rain will come and wash away my shame
Get up yes I'm talking to you
On your feet there's nothing you can do by staying down
You've got to get back up
Believe in yourself
rise back up
When it rains is pours
Pours down
When it rains is pours
Pours down
When it rains it pours
When it rain it pours down
Let the rain fall down
Let the rain fall down
When I look in the mirror I hate what I see
I've become what I swore I'd never never be
I can't do this on my own anymore
Got to find the strength
Strength to believe
I am my own own own worst enemy
This is where I draw the line
After all the promises you made
I realized that you weren't ready for this
You weren't ready for this
You've pushed me for far too long
This is where I draw the line
This is where I draw the line
I expected better from you
But you made it this way
This is where I draw the line
This is where I draw the line
You've pushed me for far too long
This is where I draw the line
This is where I draw the line
I expected better from you
But you made it this way
This is where I draw the line
This is where I draw the line
After all the promises you made I realize that you weren't read for this
You weren't ready for this
After all the time you waster
After all the things you said
I will never be like you
I'd rather be dead
We sing songs of revival with nothing in our hearts
We sing songs of His praise but only live for Him on Sunday's
We must change
Some say Christian's don't tell lies
They just sing them on Sunday mornings
Sunday Mornings
Some say Christian's don't tell lies
They just sing them on Sunday mornings
They just sing them on Sunday mornings
I thought the sick need the doctor not the healthy
I thought the church was the body not a building
We must change
I know You are always with me forever even till the end of the age
I know You are always with me forever even till the end of the age
End of the age
I am not A we are not Alone
The weight of the world is crashing down on me
Weight of the world is on my back
The weight of the world is crashing down on me
Weight of the world is on my back
Through every struggle I am not alone
Through every trial I am not alone
Through every hardship I am not alone
You are my strength I am not along
I know You are always with me forever even till the end of the age
I know You are always with me forever even till the end of time
I am not A we are no Alone
The weight of the world is crashing down on me
Weight of the world is on my back
They say home is where the heart is
Well my heart has grown black
They say you can't go home again
But this time I'm never never going back
This world is not our home
Our home
In this world I'm not along alone
This path it is my own
But I keep running back
I keep running back
I keep running back running back to You
This time is ours
It's so hard to let You go
To let You go
They say home is where the heart is
Well my heart has grown black
They say you can't go home again
But this time I'm never never going back
I keep running back
I keep running back running back to You
This time is ours
It's so hard to let You Go
To let You go
I'm coming back home
I've been down this road before
But this time I'm closing the door
I'm not looking back I'm looking ahead
Right now this is my time
I've already made up my mind
My course is set my decisions are made
From now on I will never be the same
This is my time
This is our time
When I have nothing left nothing left to give
I'll give You all I have
All I have
When I have nothing left nothing left to give
All I have
Right now this is my time
I've already made up my mind
My course is set my decisions are made
From now on I will never be the same
I'll give you all I have
I've been down this road before
But this time I'm closing the door
I'm not looking back I'm looking ahead
Juggernaut
I am unstoppable 
Crushing all opposition
Destroying all that stands in my way
On this path of destruction
no one will stand in my way
Your world is falling apart
Your walls are falling down falling down
Everything You've ever known is crashing down crashing down
I used to think that I was unstoppable
Nothing could stop me
I was invincible
Now one could judge me
A blessed man is born twice and dies once
A cursed man is born once and dies twice
Who are you to cast the first stone
And with these stones you build my home
All you've done you've done in vain
Be gone from me I do not know your name
You will reap what you sow
For every sheep that you've led astray
You will reap what you sow
For every act you've done in my name
The stone rejected by the builders has no become the cornerstone
The veil that once separated is now torn in shreds
You've turned your heart from your people
You've turned your ears from their cries
You've built your kingdoms but you're not welcome in mine
What troubles await you hypocrites
You sons of vipers hypocrites
As the venom spreads hypocrites
You chose your side hypocrites
You will reap what you sow
You will reap what you sow
In my life be lifted high
In our world be lifted high
In our love be lifted high
Higher and higher
I called you answered
and You came to my rescue and I want to be where You areI am a fountain of blood in the shape of a girl
You are the bird on the brim hypnotised by the Whirl
Drink me make me feel real wet your beak in the stream
The game we are playing is life love is a two way dream
Leave me now return tonight tide will show you the way
If you forget my name you will go astray
Like a killer whale trapped in a bay
I am a path of cinders burning under your feet
You are the one who walks me I am your one way street 
I am a whisper in water secret for you to hear
You are the one who grows distant when I beckon you near
I am a tree that grows hearts
One for each that you take
You are the intruder hand
I am the branch that you breakI am no better than you 
For I I am right there too 
Oh Brothers don't let this world get 
Into your head and get the best of you 
We've got to fight for our lives 
cause this battle rages strongest in our own minds 
This feeling of inadequacy stems from our own insecurities 
So much pressure to be a real man these days 
When they don't realize what that truly means 
Can you stand strong in the face of opposition 
And take responsibilities for your actions 
Be there to protect the ones you love no matter what 
And admit to the same insecurities everyone else has
And then the loneliness creeps in 
And the heart longs for companionship 
But our flesh is weak and we tried to fill the loneliness
With our own physical desires 
But don't tell me that the problem isn't there 
This shouldn't be a game to you 
These girls aren't a piece of meat that you can
Take advantage of until you have your fill 
And all my family and friends and I ain't scared to tell you sometimes 
I drop a tear but fear will never scare me 
The good Lord prepare me for this whole world we live in 
where most men are greedy but me I'ma keep on giving 
Cuz with em' I'ma keep on living n' walkin the right path 
Even when lifes bad I'ma still show emotion 
Gana spit it with devotion I'm deeper than the ocean 
One day I'll have a wifey and I'ma keep in faithful 
Respecter her and be grateful a woman I can be with 
Be there for my family a real man gona feel this 
Will Gamble n' The Gun Show 2011 
Take your eyes off these girls 
Cause your leading them far from home 
Don't you see your using there emotions to get what you please 
We have the power to ruin lives 
With our smooth talking tongues 
Men respect is everything 
I am a filthy pig 
God set us straightAnd out of the great beyond came a pitchblack multitude
Here to choose the weakest of our race
Hellhounds with the devil's own face
Confused a violent strike for something finally here to guide the way
Our faith in order was a mistake
So fearful and divine and devoid of grace
They try to run but there's no escape
And the light decayed on that final day
Fear crept up inside
Night became something more than a trade
And our slumber a weakness that we all can share
Death calling in the wind This is the end
I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky
It was like a call from the other side
What will you do now
The fires of hell are raining down
Deep inside you're starting to shake
And slowly losing ground
Everyone is dead  Your bravery is useless
Your bravery is useless
I watched as a spiral took shape across the sky
It was like a call from the other side
And there I cried out of control and paralyzed
As everything I once was died
There's no way I'd be dying honorably
If they came and took my life now
There's no way I'd be dying honorably
Regrets in tow they didn't even stand a chance
So hear me final lines have been drawn
To build again to fall again
It's warn me down to the last straw
It took me down took me until I don't feel human at all
Test me now test me
I don't feel human at all
So don't you go thinking that you found strength without a trial or two
These days have got me feeling like a god
Hear me final lines have been drawn
To build again to fall again
It's warn me down to the last straw
And I held on so long to my home
Until a tempest came
She came in and swept it away
Where's your bravery
What will bravery do for you now
You make your way but don't belong
I swear you're not the only one
Is that what you've been dreaming
Is that what you've been dreaming
There's other ways of staying strong
Than keeping out the other ones
I feel the light years in between
What you say and what you mean
You won't get through with that phony confidence
I hear you speak
But nothing is said
You'll be stranded on the other side
Endless nights upon endless nights
Endless nights upon endless nights
You'll be alone
Alone to the grave
There's a place in all of us same in everyone
Making right the balances in all of us
Aching and burning and growing and learning
And building the world around us
Until our lives are done we'll share the same emotions
Shed tears of eulogy then turn to plant the seeds
Still you can't hear me
Call out your name and try to get through
I never hear back never hear back
My words became a thousand arrows
Slicing through the endless barricades
So that everyone on earth could hear my call
And I watched for you
You're putting me on
You've chosen to swear off the general population
All those around you draw to a quiet
Your eyes dart across the room
But it's just an illusion
The room doesn't exist it's only you and I
And it's almost like we can't fail at all
Or maybe we've failed already
What you choose to see is real
A cold dark world of enemies
Obstacles you can never overcome
Or a bright future ahead
So tell the whole world and we'll start brand new
Strip the shackles off let me look at you
If you can't reach out like you've been longing to
I'll have to rethink all that I thought I knew
Call out your name and try to get through
I never hear back never hear back
From you
Tap the primal circuit
The current lets you know you're alive
Make this crushing power ceaseless
You could capture the world
When embracing the electric kingdom
Know that it could all come crashing down
With unseen surges coming closer
I fight to defend my denied throne
I took selected analysis
That day I never felt more addicted
Barely surviving the shock
Soon I found myself in a cruel revolving door
You said failure I said you're turning to
Cruel sources
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from cruel sources
Change up the trend for the hell of it
Then you'll see I never did support it
Carving away at the block
I became the light I'd so long been searching for
You said savior I said you're turning to
An electric current fuels the lust again
Like a feral god
I've stepped far outside the lines
But I feel no shame
I stole the scales and I cleared my name
Now try
Try to pry them from my dead hands
Now try
Try to pry them from my dead hands
Cruel sources
To discredit all I did
You've put so much of yourself
In these cruel sources
They've set you on fire
Now I'm left defending my honor from you
Slaving for my solace of mind
Digging in the sand until there's blood on my hands
Careless to the state I'm in
I've so long been alone
I've so long been alone
I can't go on
Rain down rain down
Cleanse my soul flow like a river
Forging insight by pagan torchlight
In cadence warlike
We draw tears from the sky
Because the well's run dry
Rain down rain down
Cleanse my soul flow like a river
I've spread out my seed
It's gone in all directions
It starts to feel like
The promiseland is a fantasy
And heaven has been swallowed by the desert
In a draught without submission
Not a cloud in the sky
This course keeps getting harder
The more I try
I dig up dry bones
And the corpses cry as they open their eyes
To see the world's decay
This world's a tomb
There's a clamor in my heart and it's over
Where is my prize
It's over
Where is my prize
My promised prize
Forging insight by pagan torchlight
In cadence warlike
We draw tears from the sky
Rain down rain down
Cleanse my soul flow like a river
Look at me now
I'm losing control
I don't know what to call myself
I know that I'm sick of playing a role
All along I've been kidding myself
Seeking out a set reality
They say sanity is dictated by what the larger percentage of society sees
What does that mean
Clearly nothing Clearly nothing
Psychology is not an exact science  In fact there is no exact science
Though it may seem
That means I'm OK and everything's OK
All along
I've been kidding myself
Life is falling apart at the seams
Somehow I'm doomed to go over the same ground in these compulsive circular
thought patterns
Over and over time and again
Over and over time and again
I think I've got it all worked out
Then I forget every conclusion drawn
Every epiphany gone
I felt safe
Then the walls come crashing
in one day
Without warning
Everything that I thought was stable
Deep in me starts to wash away
Can you feel it
It's the motion of the tide
Watch yourself now
There's an ocean deep inside
You could drown in it
Look at me now
I'm losing control
Might even be learning to enjoy the sting of the irony
Changing my shape I slide through the doorway
Can you feel it
It's the motion of the tide
Watch yourself now
There's an ocean deep inside
You could drown in it
Watch yourself now
There is no ocean deeper than this
Watch yourself
It's an endless journey through the abyss
All along I've been kidding myself
Working equations
It's a long walk in and there's no clear way home
Everything I was in constant change
I'm not the same
I'm not the same
To hit the mark
To bring the rain
To take a climb
The path to fame
I sat dreaming a lone
Then it came out of nowhere
An all too familiar voice with a false face
The voice of the jealous
It's less than encouraging
Walls have been closing in
Though in droves the masses came
Years from now they'll say
From the way out from the way out
Fools rushing over the hills
There to watch him fall
There to watch him fall
And there amidst the sleepless night it came to me
Endurance endurance it came to me
And now nothing can stop me or keep me in line
Get out of the way as I take to the sky
It's hard to discern all the motives I see
One thing's for sure when the crowds have dispersed and forgotten me
And forgotten their dreams
I'll still be all that I am
I am more than a clown for you
Hear me and know it to be true
From the way out from the way out
Fools rushing over the hills
There to watch him fall
There to watch him fall
Until you're ready to break
Until you're ready to bend
Critical condition critical
The years will wear down every brick you lay
There's more to life than selling your days
Money makes sense in the world today they say
I'm not living that way
Setting off setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own
I won't be a product on the industry line
You stand for nothing or you stand alone
Leave it to us to cross the final line
Can you feel the dawning of our time
Take a moment to turn and see the signs
Can you feel the dawning of our time
Time to wake up and turn the light on
Come on turn the light on
Setting off setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own
I won't be a product on the industry line
You stand for nothing or you stand alone
Pitiful
Doing what you're told
In turn
They granted you power
In a condescending tone
You stand on the watchtower
Here in our last hour
And say that you know
Typical
Of those that will never see
Say that you know
Typical
Of those that will never be free
Just like that
Took our strongest years
In the name of greed
Just like that
And made commercials out of our broken dreams
As pitch black factory stacks turn all the world's beautiful colors to gray
Empower the rights that they can't take away
Raise your voices
Echoes of the spirit
Echoes of the spirit
Resounding in tones that set you free
Shout with me
We are awake
Setting off setting off their alarms
Because I've got a voice of my own
I won't be a product on the industry line
You stand for nothing or you stand alone
We're in critical condition critical condition
Figured it out because we've all been here before
You've come to save the world
What do you believe
What do you believe
So you've been chosen
By your eyes
By your hands
By the choices that you call your own
And price that you would sell your own soul
Pay the toll
Carry your
Carry your last test of flesh and bone
We make exchanges as the story unfolds
You've come to save the world
What do you believe
What do you believe
Who are you  What have you become
A charming illusion a source of confusion
Another day you'll win the race
A charming illusion a source of confusion
Who are you  What have you become
A charming illusion a source of confusion
Another day you'll find your place
A charming illusion a source of confusion
Another rise to power
No matter who or when
And we will know of our freedom
Never again never again
A common thread of distance
In the hearts of men
And we'll have love for our brother
Never again never again
We are all the victims of a will to overcome
How far we've gone out of  touch
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war
Can't justify it
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war
To erase away
All that we've become
They can't see we're all one
A voice cries from underneath
Dark shepherds strongly though you wield the staff
You're weakened by comfort
There's no way you're prepared for what happens last
Action
Reaction
Like an eye for an eye from our tribal days
The lesser ones demand reaction
Dare to challenge the one universal law
Set you up to fall
Do you understand now
Why your days are numbered
Do you understand
The course of events were a riddle
A pause in time
A search for the solution as we stood in line
Honored our oppressors and paid our fines
Then all became clear as the ferocity inside began
To hear the drums of war resound across the land
Announcing the fate to shed blood upon the earth
It is ours
Doomed to repeat our history
There is more than one way to manifest the possibility of how things could be
No time to question how when or why
We simply come together or die
To a system of capitalist politicians
False face of a greater power
Your empire will fall
Bringing about the end of an era
Warmongers
Your bloodlust to conquer
Turns the moments of our lives
Into a ticking timebomb of your own creation
Counting down the days
Rot in your graves
How far we've gone out of touch
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war
Can't justify it
There's no right side of war
There's no right side of war
To erase away
All that we've become
To erase away
All that we love
There's no right side of war
Now that we've reached the end
And I'm the only one surviving
I'm just waiting for the morning light
To touch my skin
Warm my heart
But I see a dead world at sunrise
A dead world at sunrise
And nothing can reverse the state
Who now will pray
And save my soul
When hell ascends
And calls my name
I'm alone
And so forth and so on
Their faces left
I'm longing for death
I'm in torture
Torture
It's all that's left of my memories
The cold hard truth
Bitter and sweet
Though I can't touch them see them
They are there silent
They listen
Silent though they listen
But I see a dead world at sunrise
A dead world at sunrise
And nothing can reverse the state
We are still one
and I'm missing pieces of myself
Of myself of myselfSuch and such a hero
has done so and so

his number is upWe are the dark side of the earth
We stop the world from turnin'
We are the frozen past that hurts
Because your Future's failing
And you can't keep destroying Feel the rain
We are the noise that you can't hear
We are behind your eyes and
We make the sculptures of the air
With all your dreams and nightmares
Because we hear your prayers Feel the rain
And now you're alone there
With all your sins and all the shame
You're cryin'
You're screamin'
Save me save me
Vampires
I wanna live like vampires
I wanna give you my life

And you're so lost and you're so weak
Because you feel the violence
In every word you're sayin' Feel the rain
We are the ones you used to hate
Just cause we are not your slaves

At the end your roses fade away
And now you're alone there

You close your eyes
Cause that's when you can see her
There you can't lie
Your world is gone her touch is gone
Now you feel like
A black hole
Where feelings disappear disappear

You run and you hide
And you hate and you die
And you burn tonight
Cause you're nobody nobody
You're dark without light
You are a flame without fire
And you love tonight
But you're nobody nobody
Hey hey hey
She's beautiful like heaven
But you're in hell
She's golden sand of desert

Breathing in and breathing out
It hurts like death
Thank you god thank you for the darkness
You live for just another day
You breathe for just another day
Nobody hears you when you pray
Nobody hears you and she's Away
And your heart is broken
And nobody hears you
You're running out of life
And to die is easy
Cause nobody hears you
But you cannot leave her
She's your little suicide
She's your little suicide
You breathe for just another day
You love for just another day
This fuckin' world cannot erase
The pain you feel and she's Away
We run we move from town to town
So tired my make up's melting down
The Daylight's coming as we drive
It is my world it is my live
We run
You're sure that we will fade away
I hear you laughing as you say
Nobody makes it anyway
But we can't lie
If we are made to die
Then we will die
No you can't tell you don't know how it feels
You don't know how it's breaking me
can you hear me
You think you can sell all the tears that I bleed
You don't know how it's killing me
can you hear me
Burning like ice cause this can't be my place
Right between hell and paradise
can you hear me
This is your world and I'll show you my rage
Look at me can you hear my voice
You live we burn yeah it's OK
But if we turn into Butterflies
Tied hands become beautiful wings
then start to run cause you can't win
The push inside will find its way
Will burn exploding to your face
Music inside of me will be
The sound of rain
The sound of life
You'll need it to survive
We'll win the war We lose it
Arms around me I feel safe
Light of candles on your face
It's our last day together
It's your last day
Dance with me
It's our last day together baby
My fading roses in this scent of rain
On these wet leaves you hold me
With love and with pain
And you Burned
Dreams are craving and straving for prayers
Nobody prays for us
Dark is coming like a veil
I start to lose myself again
It's your last day together
It's your last day
Dance with me
It's your last day together baby
Reflections got so clear and
The mirror hurts but it can't lie
The shell I built is broken
The fire's back to melt the ice
My life is like the thunder
How could I live without the sound
Acting a part I blundered
I change my skin
I'm back around
I can feel you here
And I'm not dreamin'
I can feel you near
I'm not alone and you're not gone
I'm not alone
My soul is exploding
It's white just like the lightning
My soul is reloading
It's dark just like the thunder
I'm back with all my weakness
With all the tears with all the laughs
I burned my mask of bleakness
I rock again
The ground is burning burning
I need to hide
the sky is turning turning yeah
And I can fly
I'm sick of all the people
I'm sick of living living yeah
And all I need is
Run away run away run away from love
Run away from hate
Run away run away from you
I've got to run now
It's time to burn
It's time to fly
Runaway runaway runaway now
Time is bleeding I've got to run away
I am so unsubstantial
That you can't touch me
And you can't hurt me anymore
Cause you can't see me
But I can see you naked
With all the sins you hide
Yeah now you are naked to the bone
And this is why I
run away from love
run away from death
Now baby hold me tight
I know nothing is right
I have to go
Believe I'm only a ghost
Believe I'm in the past
Go
Ah touching me
Ah do you feel
Ah eternity
Ah
Tomorrow you'll hear the call
They're never gonna get your love
Tomorrow you will be the one
My angel you will be the sun
In the rain
In my cold and rainy days
When I'll be old and grey
I'll see you there
My angel in the rain
And I will feel the same
Love
Tomorrow will never come
They're never gonna get your love
Tomorrow you will be the one
My angel you will be the sun
In the rain
Out on the tar plains the glides are moving
All looking for a new place to hide
You sit beside me so newly charming
Sweating dewdrops glisten freshing your side
Way down the lane away living for another day
The aphids swarm up in the drifting haze
Swim seagull in the sky towards some hollow
Western isle
My envied lady holds you fast in her gaze
And the sun drips down bedding heavy behind
The front of your dress all shadowy lined
And the droning engine throbs in time
With your beating heart
Sing blue Silver
And watching lovers part I feel you smiling
What glass splinters lie so deep in your mind
To tear out from your eyes with a word to stiffen
Brooding lies
And I'll only watch you leave me further behind
Dark city
I feel the scream
Dark city
It's in the wind
Dark city
Here I can be
Dark city
electricity
Dark city
The dead's alive
Dark city
And I can't hide
Dark City
is killing me
Dark city
The fear to stay alone
The fear to stay aloneFear the great Pyramid the domain of the sacriledge
Disgusting powers wield this place of horror
The ancient gods are back on earth we serve the book of blood
The blood of men will drench the fields in darkness
Tear off their clothes sting out their eyes
Lead the doomed prisoners to the sacrificial stone
Spread their limbs for ritual slaughter
Hispanic blood floats down the walls
Here in the temple of horror
Corpses are paled upon the stakes to please the ancient gods
Doomed to slaughter sacrifice
Limps entangled in gore
The demigods from far away burn our souls in hell
Open their chests and tear out their hearts for the gods of blood
Their hearts were shown to the sun
Fertile blood floats from the ritual stone
We cut off their limbs and their skull will be paled to serve the ancient gods from hell
The voice from the gods of thunder their breath will bring us death
Spitting balls of iron 
Annihilation of civilization doom
I am Cortez I kill in the name of Rome
Hunting down the heathens their blood is on my hands
I slaughter in Gods name
I violently serve the heavens
We are born in the moonlight and killed by the sun
We are the bloodsucking creatures of the night
We do not know love and we desire for lust in this night of endless pain
Standing proud in endless rows the defeated dead hang stiff and still
Perverse thoughts ordered upon battalions hungering to maim and kill
Our hearts are death and our souls are raped as we hail for the final command
Charging through pile the dead upon the dead
Endless straights of anonymous corpses
Sliding the skins off the unfortunate soldiers
Leaving them to rot in the impure winds of war
Stench from the purulent clays beneath 
Soil and flesh trampled to bloody snot
Trenches flooding with blood and gore
 Here is no peace here is no beauty
We are with one as we are with many
Thousands of throats cry for violence and death
Torched villages mark the theatre of the macabre
Black blood Frozen eyes feasting with the undead
Bow for me pathetic mortals your God is dead for ages
Impaled like thousands of your despised people
Eyes gazing glassy and vacant at the bloodred sky
Violently condemned to see your dying God above
We are born in the moonlight and killed by the sun
We are the bloodsucking creatures of the night
My knights of hell slaughter the legions of Mohammed
The tortured Mudjahedeen scream their agony upon the stake
Beneath the shadow of thy throne still may we dwell secure
Suffering is thine arm alone and our defense is sure
A thousand ages in my sight are like an evening gone
I am the one who ends your life before the rising sun
My word commands your flesh to dustReturn ye sons of men
Immortals rose from earth at first and my blood will live again
Beneath the shadow of my throne still may we dwell secure
Suffering is thine arm alone and our defense is sure
A thousand ages in my sight are like an evening gone
Behold my cathedral of death see my forest of flesh
Taste the blood of the enemies the enemies of Vlad
I eat their broken eyes I curse their gasped pray
Allah's war is lost today
Dark Seraphim Slayer of Jihad
Death in Carpathia the massacre is done
Face the flesh horizon destructor misantrophe
The corpses of the impaled Turks penetrate your hopes
No Sultan no don't go away
No Sultan no your judge is just on its way
You shall die before the rising sun
My word commands your flesh to dustReturn ye sons of men
Immortals rose from earth at first and my blood will live again
A thousand ages in my sight are like an evening gone
I am the one who ends your life before the wanking nuns
I know there will be no light for me
My soul was baptised in the darkest depths
I serve the horns I proclaim blasphemy
I curse the face of God traitor
We bore through their blasphemous tongue with a hot iron
They would be tied to the rack and stretched for days at a time
We wove their bloody limbs between the spokes of the wheel
And hung them into the air for the birds to complete the execution
No word came over their bursted lips they spit blood in my eyes
The immortality of their souls glorifies the blood divine
Ave ave Satanas
I curse the face of God traitor
Ave ave Satanas
I proclaim blasphemy
I doubt on my immortality
I am caught in the snares of death
I must die for my sacrilege
There shall be no dawn for me
Embrace the deadly kiss of the iron maiden
Flashes before your eyes sensations at the gallow's end
We bore through their blasphemous tongue with a hot iron
In the name of all that is holy
I clean their souls in flames
Traitor
My rage of mystery and terror raped the empire of Rome
On the fringes of the empire I will arrive
I serve the book of blood
The monster from darkness a murderer with joy
I am the scourge of the gods I am the King of Huns
With the imperial sword of doom I enjoy in terror
I am the plague of  the thousand burning cities
With lust I eat the flesh of my enemies
Slaying my enemies I delight in war
Their blood gives me strength to slay the forces of Rome
We ride our war horses out of the great steppes of Asia
We bring the scourge of death upon the city of Naissus
King of Huns terror of Rome
I am Attila known as the scourge of God
Slay the defeated chop off their heads
Of the parasites of the Great Hungarian Plain
We do not undeserve the reputation of cruelty
Devestating the city of Naissus
Gutters filled with blood
We are the mounted breath from hell
Blazing through the city as the prophecy of death
Their carcasses will be consumed to feast on our victory
I am the one you fear
I pave your path to hell with the skulls of Rome
I curse the temple of Jupiter
I smash the face of Mars
They conspire in their caves in their envious world of emptiness
Preparing for Jihad to obey their desert god
They murder for belief to deflower 70 virgins
These brave Mudjahedeen brought Gaza in darknesss
Their God is a worm baptised in the blood of the prophet
On the hills of mount Sinai we meet in Armageddon
The laws of the Sharia will not impress upon us
Your holy army blotted out pounded into sand
In the napalm sea the suns of Ismael bathe in flames
Is this the prophet's breed Headless corpses return to dust
They have defiled our graves their punishment will be endless
Our blistering napalm rain wipes them from the face of the earth
We desecrate the black stone
Slayer of Jihad
We do not obey their wretched desert God
We are impure
We are unrepentant your final blasphemers
We distort your image of God
The walls of Jericho will fall again
We root out the seeds of the Mudjahedeen
The golden dome shall return to sand
The blood of your forefathers shall be shed on mount Arafat
The bastard sons of Abraham shall never rise up again
The laws of the Sharia will not impress upon us
Your holy army blotted out pounded into sand
The pest of Arabia shall not overwhelm us
Their lustful prophet desecrates the innocent virginal skin
In my dreams I go back to the forest of flesh
Where the Ottomans lay slain before the cathedral of death
The sacred black stone the black seeds of Jihad
We blaspheme in the presence of their backward desert God
Impalement is delightful let us urinate on foes
We hammer the stake through the back of their throats
Face the flesh horizon destructor misantrophe
The corpses of the impaled Turks penetrate your hopes
They have defiled our graves their punishment will be endless
Our blistering napalm rain wipes them from the face of the earth
We desecrate the black stone
Slayer of Jihad
Slaying the Wounded no prisoners we take
Counting the deaths and piss on their graves
The Meister of Krieg they pray for his death
The triumph from hell the symbol of death
Bow down your head and rip out your tongue
For the glory of Death and the crown of the horns
I murder like Manson when I cut out her womb
In the blood that she bled she lay drowned in her tomb
Suffocate Inhale death's breath the crown of thorns tortures my head
Rape my wounds my doomed bloodlet receive my last caress
Demonclaws tore my skin salicious women prove my sin
The seventh day had just begun and soon your God will die
 I am the guardian of your brother
You damn sheep belong to others
Demonhordes have raped you mother
And burned the witch alive
I am drowning in desire
You create this global fire
Lord you are a goddamn lair
Let's hang the bastard Christ
Screams sound like music when I strangle the whore
Entangled in bloodlust entangled in gore
Slashed and naked she laid down on the floor
I copulate darkness and she will breathe no more
Suffocate Inhale death's breath the crown of thorns torture my head
Rape my wounds my doomed bloodlet receive my last caress
Demonclaws tore my skin salicious women prove my sin
The seventh day had just begun and soon your God will die
I am drowning in desire
You create this global fire
Lord you are a goddamn lair
Let's hang the bastard Christ
Slaying the Wounded no prisoners we take
Counting the deaths and piss on their graves
The Meister of Krieg they pray for his death
The triumph from hell the symbol of death
Crowd obsessed with blood and gore
Satisfied by the bloody spectacle
Witness the public funeral
In the ancient arena of death
Beast to men men to men beast to beast
For the praise of the Vestal Virgins
Prisoners fight each other to death
Kill them flog them burn them
Victims soiled with blood to lure the wild animals
Condemned to face a starved wild beast
For their Lord Jesus Christ they die between the jaws of the lion
When the wounded gladiator eats sand
Demons from the underworld come to assure his death
Hitting him with hammers and burning him with hot iron
Dragged out of the arena with the glorious playing of trumpets
The mutilated body passed away to the Libitinarian Gate
Pass away in splendour
Steer away with Charon
Ave imperato morituri te salutant
To face the goddess Libitina
Hail emperor men soon to die salute thee
Gladiators in chariots dressed in purple
Obsessed with gore and slaughter
Victims soiled with blood to lure the wild animals
Condemned to face a starved wild beast
For their Lord Jesus Christ they die between the jaws of the lion
Romans obsessed with bloody battles and death
Pontifex Maximus Caligula enjoys the sacrifice of blood
When the wounded gladiator eats sand
Demons from the underworld come to assure his death
Gladiators in chariots dressed in purple
Obsessed with gore and slaughter
Ave imperato morituri te salutant
Hail motherfucker men soon to die salute theeWhen we meet with good intentions in mind it's like tying your arms to the northbound train
When you extend your hand for peace it's like tying your legs to the southbound train
You practiced this speech well but your bullshit is stronger than your rotten breath
When you hold your hand and cry apologies all I can hear is the train bell ringing All aboard
The trains begin tugging
I love knowing that when you kiss your child that my dick filled the same pussy walls it came from
I don't I don't I don't agree to dis dis dis disagree
Smell the dick on the kid
You pulled me in to feel my touch I hear your torso giving up I'll never forget the way you hugged flaps of flesh hanging at the ends of your body bones and muscles skipping along the tracks they're falling out part by part what a disgusting mess you are inside
The trains pick up speed and are no longer in sight happy to have company
Lying naked with her legs spread open was the last time I saw that much of someone's insides
I close the night off with a dance along the tracks
Remember my face dirty man
Smack me with a frying pan maybe this will all come back to you
You gave me a fever a long time ago I never got better
Remember me yet
This is where I celebrate my recovery
I'll find creative ways to strip your body parts and use them as weapons of torture my mother will be proud
Maybe you can appreciate this saw created with your nails use it to cut off your lips and stuff them in your nostrils empty my bladder into your dirty mouth
Gargle my fluid
Hum you and old tune while we dismember your legs
Hung upside down by your waist I blindfold myself with the skin of your thigh spin 5 times and use your leg to swing at you like a pinata
You explode the remedy all over me
My fever is gone and so are you
Their arms frantically tossed through the air
While his hands were together reciting a prayer
Jesus my lord don't take this good man just let him finish what you began
Stop covering this pavement with his blood can you hear me can you hear me
The cameras start to roll now everyone can see
To feed his family caused someone else to be taken from theirs
It's head is now one with the pavement and it's hiding behind the flares
Time for heaven or is it back to the shelter
Well lying inside of a coffin is always going to be a warm temperature
Naked and damned the load is trapped and rolled away
Midnight appetite sirens silent
Did you know that pedestrians always have the right of way
Their lives came together when they danced in the street it's really unexpected how some people meet
One's lying in the street the other sits in a back seat and another relationship is then complete
There has never ever been a dull moment  we can kiss the highest clouds and name them after movie stars
Your fingers they're flower pots
And as the cuticles crack the stem comes through you'll never know a poet's eyes unless you see them for yourself
Hear me now
After the truth is found there will be a suicide
Hear me now and grant my wishes as sins not ignorance
Endangered now with pockets full of oil
All I have left is a face fucking homicidal waste of time
Take these roads and take them fast
My legs collapse in harmony with the music and I plummet down forever
I can write the dialogue to a script about your death
I'm walking across 2nd Avenue I'm tripping across Lexington I'm falling down Park Avenue and dying on Broadway
We can wish amongst wish hope against hope
You have become a new bloody valentine
Over and over again I've watched you killing yourself
Hold my hand let's start the decay
One shot in the mouth
You'll never know a poet's eyes unless you see them for yourself
The path has changed so much over the years
No reason to fret just turn around and walk away
The glass of wine and the plate of overcooked food burnt too long Paranoid about a fuck me dress
Relishing in memories twisting like fate
It's only a matter of time before this is destroyed
The bridges are too low to duck under and the fenced in possibilities seem too dark to see without candlelight
Because years have passed visions have also
Down under there's a devil and no one notices
Above us are clouds that swing and hang down over a small town
Obstruction of vision is nullified by the elevation of the seats
An orchestra pit down under like Australia that catches fire from a match
The path has changed so much over the years
Slimy sticky leaves cling like leaches
No reason to fret just turn around and walk away
The glass of wine and the plate of overcooked food
I'll never run away again
I missed this
Stand Clear of the closing doors
Punch in your sleazy dignity
It's almost time to eyeball those interns
Eight hours of conference calls
One eight hours of brown nosing
One two eight hours of boardrooms
One two three eight balls of white godliness
Put down the pen paperweight pig
Insatiable wants and greed
Put down the pen paperweight pig
Hang your head for what you lead
The weekends are the only time I really live
The cancer lies within us all
They can't whisper when they wanna scream
They can't work as a team
When they wanna be covered in whipped cream
Kiss your wife not that intern
Corporate world has no uturn
If you applied then just don't return
Business mastercards used for lapdances
Money under the table for congressmen
For those broken environment regulations
Anything is possible in the corporate world
Million dollar compensation for executives
While posting billion dollar quarter loses
Trapped in a cubical I'm throwing a party in my head
It's all meaningless
Take my picture I want to have proof of this history I want the lake in the back and all this beauty in my heart they like to hide in the marsh
Like a child on a tire swing they swoop in on an arch to brush the fish home
Dinner is served to the younger the late bloomers lay their eggs and they all sway to the music of the brushing weeds
I want to conserve I want to protect I want to defend we have to preserve
How can I help before this will end
The bees need to stay busy butterfly wings need to keep the flowers in motion the trail needs to stay warm so you stay away from their home
You and everyone like you are selfish destroyers and I'll be just as selfish when i don't give you back
One drill through your heart two chisels in your eyes three nails to crucify you
I will turn your project to news headlines
We all thought the same it was going to be okay thankful for my clean brain
Scratched my head felt the dandruff piling up underneath my fingernails
Thankful for my clean brain
He's just a boy flying to space in a cardboard box sleeping on the moon in his dreams
Fly your flag forever don't let anything stop you
Cancers don't grow and there is no such word as suffering
Next time you fall asleep look down on us at earth and realize that it may be better to forever count sheep
You're the captain of your ship and star
For today you will shine and be impervious to pain we have all admired your bravery
With boots tied and chin up we watch you fly away
Through stormy weather  hold your ground
Keeping your eyes fixed on the prize
This must have been God's mistake and correction by giving you eternal life
So young but in good hands the strength of 100 armies to keep your evils at bay
Just keep walking and keep flying and never give up
I am my own killing moon
The hunter and the prey
A baptism in dirty water
Escaped from th e crucifix
But still carry the weight
A baptism in dirty water
These impure thoughts lead to soulless action
And the cycle continues
Furthered by the thought of a confused soul
A man with no release
Concerned by his own thoughts
Slowing the rotation of the cogs and the gears
A halting machine
A haunting disease
A man with no release
Immersion in the wrong sorts
This is my manifesto
Tingly body
Mind sunk deep within
An arbitrary conversation
Looking seeing and feeling the wrongs
A simplified overcoming of stature and belonging
Nevermore this overcompensated disillusion of downtime and no time of babbling
I will set aside and overcome with suds of porter in hand
A mildmannered genius has come to save me
I seem to rise as morning draws near
Pushing through fields of tracks green and alive
The dew draws close to my hung down body feeling alone but in the comfort of friends
If I drew this close to perfection every moment I would be the field and I would be the green
A conflict of mind and matter
I would live in harmony beside you
But never aloneCringing at the sight flawless face dragged
I giggled kissing my fingers type c and saliva bubbling
Kissing my fingers
Find an easier way of dying before you get murdered
Type c and saliva bubbling
Kissing my fingers
The floor boards will never hold the same finish
The soiled ground for the sacrifice
Dispelled crippling faulty holyland
I am your martyr your stigmata
The tears turn to blood beneath my eyes
My body listens as you whisper
My fingers bend as I'm nailed to your cross
The splinters etch hearts in my back
I denounce this crucifixion I demand another sacrifice
A cast shadow over this narrow hill
Pulling my fingers from these nails
There will be no use for a second coming
I took her to an empty house in Westchester I had already picked up
When we got there I told her to wait outside pick wild flowers
I went upstairs and stripped all of my clothes off
I knew if I did not I would get her blood on them
When all was ready I went to the window and called her
Then I hid in the closet until she was in the room
She saw me all naked and began to cry and tried to run downstairs
I grabbed her and she said she would tell her mama
First I stripped her naked
How she did kick bite and scratch
I choked her to death
Then I cut her into small pieces so I could take my meat to my room cook
And eat it
Sweet and tender her ass roasted in the oven
It took me nine days to eat her entire body
I did not fuck her
Though I could have as I wished
She died a virgin
Dragged to the burial where witches flew overhead
Roses drip black and children weep in awe at their mother's side
And tissues break shows your ample wit
To get back at your bastards lust
Razor proof veil and an odor less scarf bring the day to rust
Blue dress at a black grave
Razor proof veil and an odor less scarf bring the day to rust
What you've accomplished towards me was sickening
So I'll be sure to return the favor
You hurt me horribly I turned back you killed me
I haven't for much but I'll ask you this
Why would you destroy your best friend
I'm so tired of looking into mirrors just to see the reflection cry
So plain and simple I need you to die
As there piling away your worthless body
I'll be sure to shatter the tombstones that are laid
Theres nothing more I'd rather see
Than you chasing bullets as you fall into a tunnel
Then your heart goes comatose and your appendages torn off
Sending out the harmony that you're gone
You're gone
YOU'RE GONE
Place this picture of my face in your lovers' hands
Watch her dying in pain and disbelief
Now you're gone now you're gone
YOU'RE GONE
I feel that I've done my part
But now it's time to stop this beating heart
How could you destroy
Your best friend
But now it's time for me to stop beating
From these bloody hills
Comes unmixed oil and water
Concentrated by abstract particles
Distilled through cross pollination
Pick up this doll and watch the girl dream
Cups spill what holds what holds what holds tomorrow
Clenching the fist raising the brow
As glass enters the vein
Justice shines in her dark eyes
As an amber sky drips a tear upon a sunset
This is seraplis dream ten crowns drop
Parchment paper crumbles when the curtain falls
Shade this tribulation in pastels
Silk feelings hurt
The river holds the color you describe as loveI faced this room about a thousand fucking times
They wanna change me but I think I'm doing fine
I've got a lot on my mind I've got some things to work out
You must be foolish or blind to think that I've burned
Things change everyone changes
Same town with all new faces
I can't fight it can't stop it NO
Probably suffer till I slit my own throat
His tongue has ruined many things within my path
But then again it's probably brought me where I'm at
I'm a sick motherfucker with a crooked smile
And if you think you gotta problem I'll just add you to the pile
The crows are waiting
The crows are waiting on me 
There's no escaping there's no escaping this place 
I broke my mother's heart
I've lost my father's trust
It was the murder threats that came between the three of us
God damn I'm everything you think I am
Drank myself into this hole and I might need a hand
Withdraw withdraw my nostrils caked in Adderall 
I'm gone I'm gone got nothing but these bedroom walls 
Gotta get my fix one more time
That's right one more line
I can't be satisfied until I feel paralyzed 
The crows are waiting
The crows are waiting on me 
There's no escaping there's no escaping this place
