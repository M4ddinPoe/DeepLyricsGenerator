ï»¿Look at all of us running
Always behind always late
We're always playing catch up
In this human race
All of these young men dying of old age
To feel alive could cost you everything
It's hard to hold onto your ideals
When the dreams you've caught
Aren't the dreams you've chased
Now your hearts are bleeding
To keep this pace
The kid you were
Hates the man you became
You can't remember what you wanted
You just can't
Feel the same
Remember what you wanted
Remember what you chased
All of these young men dying of old age
To feel alive could cost you everything
It's hard to hold onto your ideals
When the dreams you've caught
Aren't the dreams you've chased
Now your hearts are bleeding
To keep this pace
The kid you were
Hates the man you became
You can't remember what you wanted
You just can't
Feel the same
Look at all of us running
Always behind always late
We're always playing catch up
In this human race
Remember what you chased
Music city never shines so bright
As the nights when coming home to those lights
I have traveled the whole world wide
And I can't find a better place to reside
Every single tour takes me kicking and screaming
this Nashville heart's still beating
Take me back home to all the kids in Rtown
Who know me for me
My heart's back in music city
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Alert the skies as hell retreats
I'm saying goodbye to my apathy
To all the workers in this town
Losing their minds in this great modern hell
The ghosts have their guns and they will destroy
As wolverines break out
But tell Sophia and Alcina
We're still kicking it
Take me back home
Take me back home
Music city
Is where my heart beats
Music city
Is where my heart beats
With the heart of a child my tainted eyes have
Not lost every ounce of innocence
I still fight to hold onto my youth
I won't give into death like you
Kingdom of youthfulminded
Positive but not innocent
We still fight to hold onto our youth
We won't give into death like you
We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing
They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything
With the heart of a child
We will live forever
Children live forever
We won't be misled
We won't be misled
We won't be misled by broken dreams of wealth
We won't be misled
We will live forever
Children live forever
We will live forever
Children live forever
We are not a product of society
We are not a sick dying breed
For the meek will inherit the earth
As the weak watches its riches burn
We may have nothing to show
We may have nowhere to go
But with the heart of children
We need nothing
They say we've wasted our lives
They say we're wasting our time
But with the heart of children
We have everything
Hallelujah
Children live forever
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
With the heart of a child we will live forever
Dreams are the soul's misfortune
Meaningless and insecure
This heart could try and heal itself
But I've gone and lost the cure
He was dead to me years ago
But losing her was an eternal blow
I've spoke in the past of the broken
But now I really know
So why jump your turn
I'm living day by day
There's strange comfort in apathy
I'm living day by day
There's strange comfort in apathy
Lay cold and alone in the ground
Will it be paradise or will you burn
This is all a gamble
Until it's your turn
He was dead to me years ago
But losing her was an eternal blow
I've spoke in the past of the broken
But now I really know
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
Son to none
No home but the roads I roam
Son to none
No home but the roads I roam
Home is where the broken heart is
Home is where the broken heart is
We're all brokenhearted
These wheels are turning in my head to slowly go
Where I'd rather be instead laying low
Skin and bones we know
Made of stone move slow
Move slow
These are the days
Fear takes its hold around my throat
Lost is the chase
Hands and feet won't move
All these things we'll lose
We'll lose
These are the days
Fear takes its hold around my throat
Lost is the chase
Giving in to distance left to go we can go home
Before the devil knows I'm dead
This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
This place is a waiting room
Hoarding the diseased waiting their turn
Sicker and sicker I wait and wait
I feel my lungs becoming numb
Pacing and pacing I wait and wait
I feel my legs becoming numb
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Murdered or the murderers we're all the same
Murdered or the murderers we're all the same
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Doctor I've got this lump in my throat
It's not the cigarettes that stunt my growth
Hell walks the earth his name is pain
I swear to God I've seen him
He's no stranger to me I know him well
I'll write your name into the stars
We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
Salvation for these many scars
They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
Can you hear me
Can you tell me what this all means
And why God am I here
We are all the same we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places
If all roads lead home then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by day
Am I in hell Am I in hell
You've taken this a step too far
We all have hell at our backs ready to take us
We need you staying where you are
They say everything happens for a reason
And we all have purpose here
Can you hear me
Can you tell me what this all means
And why God am I here
We are all the same we fight the same fight
With different faces in different places
Demons by other names they haunt us at night
With different faces in different places
If all roads lead home then home is pain
I swear to God I've been there
This place gets stranger by day
Am I in hell Am I in hell
We all fight for peace of mind
We all fight for peace of mind
We all have hell at our backs
Haunting our dreams
In the beds in which we weep
We all have hell at our backs
Haunting our dreams
In the beds in which we weep
My cynicism was never yours to boast
You've greatly missed the point of what was said
Robots zombies cattle herded by others' words
It was never meant to be like this
Breeding your anger was not my intention
Though that be the case I've made this bed
And now we all have to weep in it
Hate dissension between brothers of the same
Words meant to provoke thought misread instead
Was I even right in my accusations
My words are a weak foundation for your war
Hate dissension war
Did I start this
Hate dissension war
I can't stop this
I can't stop this
It was never meant to be like this
Breeding your anger was not my intention
Though that be the case I've made this bed
And now we all have to weep in it
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
If the pen is stronger than the sword
We will end the world with screens and keyboards
Speak of regretting and all the risk we take
Speak to the morning and when our eyes awake
When the world sings of all its trouble
And I hear all about its pain
I'll listen in for its groans are not in vain
It's hard to remember how these dreams were made
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
With no place to call home
Run away
From everything you've ever known
Run away
With no place to call home
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
I have no place to call my home
Gain a friend then I lose a friend
I'm losing touch with everyone at home
It's really hard when you're born born to roam
I've run and run
I've drove and drove
Three hundred thousand miles of lonely roads
To see the ones I love at home
Move on and on without me I'm just a memory
Is this the life I chose
Have I chosen poorly
Or has it chosen me
Will it let me go now
With action comes reaction
We're all a slave to something
Dreams aren't meant to be lonely
Will you answer me
Is this heaven or hell
Is this living the dream
Or is this a living nightmare
Five years long
I've been running these open roads
Five years long
With no place to call home
The world is on fire
And I've done nothing but watch it burn
The world is on fire
And soon it will take the last of us
The world is on fire
The world is on fire
I've been thinking a lot these days
What if hell's not all fire and devils
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
We are all murderers here
This is the life we chose the life we lead
There's only one guarantee here
None of us deserves to be set free
My hopes and dreams are setting
They're setting with the sun
The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast down from the Heavens yet never Fallen
He  whom gods hath scorned
Eden's imbecile perimeter ruptured
I am of the Shining One
Whip merciless their flesh
Goad with firebrands
Trumpet the advent of the bloodspray
Enraptured by torment and flames
Broken on the rack crush the cult of Nazarene
My cup runneth over
Each Nazarene I kill
Is one thorn more
In the crown of their false saviour
A king foresworn in a halo of flies
Prostrate disciples of derisive subjection
Their spirits exude deification of defeat
A talisman profane  vile birthright borne
Enslaving vigour as if nailed to a cross
Scoff at this inheritance of wretchedness
The Daimons erect shatter shackles of deceit
Sons of Vengeance consecrate burning ways
Wolves no longer in the guise of the weak
Gammadion upon our shields
The Conquerors draw nigh
Pentagrammaton  ashes to dust
Unbridled conflagrations purify
Christhammer
Swoon  poison souls procured
Acknowledge the rot of divinity
The dream pervades mysterious and lewd
I am One of Many offered unto thee
Bearing proud the brand of sacreligion
Sacrificed not in vain to Azazael
Cast aside despair in chaos consecrate
For visions become truth in wakefullness
The seeming sorrows that mark my face
With head held high are tears of joy
I am the spear in the wound of christ
Corvus corax descending
Through ashes smoke and pain
Stark sepia sigil of strength
The revealing stench of victory
Lycanthropic ripping death
A baptism in annihilation
Drips from the jaws and howls
An ultimate oblivion conceived
Wartorn
A solution for flesh and bone
The morbid throne the strong revere
With genocide
Our might makes right
Where charnal houses
Leer at the world
Where crown and cudgel
Ferocity
Rains from the skies
Withered rotted bodies unburied
Lay piled in stacks instead
Vermin swarm and vultures gather
To feast upon the dead
Anthemic holocaust and hate
Stern lord of war and vengeance
Rough beast slouching eternal
Resolves the world to dust again
Wartorn
Beasts of prey strike with lightning speed
Wagons of war collide
Metallic plague armored locusts drive
Into the storm of steel
Exterminate  feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar
Motorized slaughter panzers smash
Reliquary immemorial of runic conquest
Wincing crablike across a scarred land
Into the storm of steel
Bombs flagellate as poisoned rain
Corrosives soaking deep
The skin of earth erupts in sores
Wounds and filth unending
Winged death  spurting flames vilify
Splatter the Whore of Armageddon
Gutteral ejaculate  mummifying rust
Disintegrating bones to dust
Exterminate  feed the battlefield hunger
With honor that is loyalty unto death
Cauldrons swarming spearhead boiling over
The ironmonger's engines roar
Petals ripen glisten with yearning
Sanctified vessel inflamed
Fervent fingers twitch the gulf is closed
Envelop the pillar of alabaster
Cockroach entrenches in some awful orifice
Excavating living tissue
Barbaric caress  greased up and slick
pain scraping a backwards bending
Clamps smear open a warm paradise
Ribcage and vertebral column contracted tight
Bars stretched beneath the skin
Lips pulled back and drawn for curing
Penetrate  probing swollen infestation
Fisted into comprehension
Rigid so to bend contorted and suffer
Straight jacket of sadism
Phallelujah
Sanguinary rite of passage
Sweet tongues of fire
Phallelujah
Paroxims of union
Phallelujah
Judas tongue scrapes spit
Bites the hand that feed it
Infectious features baring cracked teeth
Bleeding gums of joy
Phallelujah
Flaying souls breach the vestal wall
Chorus of angels consortium of pain
Enriched blood of freshly esoterica
Mingles with man in fluid form
Outpouring thrust pelvic abominations
Thick film of sweat grim lubrication
Soon to suckle maggots at her breasts
Celebrate the palsied throes of innocence
Phallelujah
In the dancing blaze of world cremation
Ashes usurp the thrones of untruth
In the glowing funeral pyres
Where shadows and smoke no longer betray
Furnace fired  matter laid bare
The true nature of existence
Reap the whirlwind
Mercifully engulf the current universe
Reap
Reap the whirlwind
Unfetter a seedling chaos to spawn
Strip away the artificial mantle
The veneer that pompously claims
That this world is worthy of salvation
Self satisfaction  armageddon
For that is all we can ask for
Every leader a fool with a facade
Every holy man a sinner
Every love a selfish lust
Every war an orgy of laughter
Every living creature a cancer
A defilement  this flesh corrupts
Reap
All truth is fabrication
Almighty hallowed nothingness
All paths spiral downwards
All answers winged lies
All questions should be phrased with axes
Indulge celebrations enshrined in blood
Astride the inexorable
Jericho's wall shall crumble divine
Grasp the horns of the Dragons of Chaos
Furious we ride
Lascivious  that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
Ripping sacred vestments  venereal debauch
Frozen phalanx thrusts
Dampened walls summmon hallucinations
Erupting wicked cold that burns like fire
Daughters of joy await the vulgar visitation
Depravity nocturnal  emissive lusts they crave
Inject impurity filth and fornication
A winged satyr raping unsullied maids
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm of the despicable unborn
Urinary baptism and licked clean
Eat until it poisons me
Enslaved to those fleshly folds
Erected into bleakness
Unchaste phantasmagoria
The salacious sordid pulse prevails
Corrupting every orifice
Greedy for love
This flesh corrupt
On bestial bloodstained wings
Rites of disgust
The incubus obscene
Lascivious  that which lies upon
A chimera of orgiastic buggery
Sodomite pedophile gaping welterd cunt
A lewdness flailing enter clubbing whip
Bestial defloration serpent riding virgin whores
Their bloodied gates wide open for all to see
Into the realm of the despicable reborn
What is to be of this pestilience
That makes empires tumble like tears
The dust of millenia  fallen ages
Staunches the flow of dawning horizons
Obscuring 
While the days crumble as their hours unfold
A sensual swooning  prophetic mocking
As the soils swallow the seeds of the past
Each one of us to his own
Embrace
Drowning in hallowed solitude
Swallowing the void
The pallid hope revealed at last
Embrace
*Why should I fret in microcosmic bonds
That chafe the spirit and the mind repress
When through the clouds gleam beckoning beyonds
Whose shining vistas mock man's littleness*
Throw off those shackles of sufferance
This penance of one thousand ordeals
I wield the scepter of destiny
Choose the means of my own death
Give me both nails and a hammer
Harness those ecstasies of death
Prostrate myself on cruciform
At last
With swift feet I made my way
Helmed by a cacophony of despair
Deaf to the legacy of youthfullness
And beauty and joy since pined away
Yet now a rush falls upon my ears
Of dripping  whispering words
The hole of emptiness I pour through
Unveils the caress from far beyond
Now no longer can I ignore
What goes before has gone again
The silence of immorality
Satisfied with this one fell step
Plunge beneath the waters 
The freezing embrace of the goddess of death
Awake Sons of Vengeance rise
Rub the dust of twenty centuries from your eyes
Today we conquer the self  tomorrow the world
Men of war defiant  to ashes fall the gods
Apocalyptic deeds  fierce archonic might
A knell a pall masking honored rites of spring
The empyreal majesty of abyss winds
An affirmation of struggle
Like wolves closing in for the kill
Making holy our war immortal this glorious night
A brotherhood of iron  falling in we march
Shout into the star shattered Dawn
We are Sons of Vengeance
Blessed and bold
Reborn in hate
Fingers of scorn fists of furious destruction
Discipline of steel beyond the roar of all war
Unleashed lightning storm brigades to be
Powerful creative joyous and free
There is a land in the middle east region
ruled by black gold
and a crazy religion
There is a satan with certain charisma
the tyrant has the power of words
His bible is built on barbaric foundations
laws from a forgotten century that live again
to die is a straight way to glory
Black widows march proclaim their own slavery
and even children grow to fighters in war
David fights Goliath Uncle Big Satan
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
A hellish old man plans the overkill riot
it's his demonstration of might
We won't retain to fight it back
save the ballance land he rules
We'll hold the power on the border
they've sworn the oat
hand die on his order
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
So it's destroyed the work of a century
the iron towers melt down in the fire of hate
No survivor in a war out of gain
pain or glory described in the book of all fates
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
He is responsible

Wings of an angel

Rising from the night of time
rising from damnation
growing furtive to old size
a thousand years old nation
Finding victims for their Reich
the lands' got a lot of strangers
they call back the crystal night
to burn the war creation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Then the last man of their kind
finished life in prison
he's a martyr for their aims
started killing seasons
Now they march the insane hords
call the NeoNation
again the right hands risen high
a skinny revelation
In a land where neighbours are stranger
sand misleaded feel caled for avenger
sin a land with blood
covered history
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Banned graphitti on the walls
words of hate and murder
waiting for their masters call
back in line and order
In a land where neighbours are strangers
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Back to the dark
Rising their hands higher
Back into the past
from the night of time
Seventh day restless I wait
yes I wait for the right word
twelve o'clock this is my time
time to change to the nightbird and like
a snake I am winding myself into tight jeans
the look on my face's gonna make all the
girls know what I mean
I come in the music stops
and you see everyone turning
then I walk cool as I can
straight to the bar and start smoking
I feel hot looks in my back
and I'll soon chose my victim
I am the king and my right is to show you
what I need
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
so show action and go
I think of the time that I waisted
how can you tell till you've tasted
Why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life
My straight face is lying about motions
that live in my heart
like a figure of stone
I am waiting for you to start
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
I think of the time that I waisted
how how can you tell till you've taisted
why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life
You're running into tragedy
signs announcing danger
for your life
will end in agony
and your bodies will decay to dust
Dust you are created of
and eternal laws can never change
change in our universe
dust to dust decays
You'll roast in flames
with the soals fo no name
your bones burste under mountains of bones
A voice from some
whereis calling your name
when you're in league with the gods
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
Everything that you achieved
all you tried has been in vain
you're treated with indignity
somewhere in a nowhere you will
fight
for the right to survive
don't blasphemise the holy signs
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
you will decay
Somewhere on a border
forced to march in line and order
looo men in greedy hands
Lured with hope for future
pressed in contracts
leaving them no chance
but to leave their land
They're nameless young men
bleeding their hands
on the edge of life
and they feel the hate
treated like slaves
There's a shanty village
where they are folded in dirt
dirt and a mess
intimidations breaking
the free will of men
free will of men
free will of men
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Somewhere in a office
noble looking and expensive
accepted by a corrupt state
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Locked in a cage
tied with invisible chains
on iron walls of pain
faces expressing their torture
denying their age
1000 years
reflected in mirrors of eyes
and brain
flowing rage
a rage crushing in fragments
past recorgnition their mind
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Stranger
Stranger from a foreign land
Back to back here we stand
our guns they are ready and loaded
ten steps forward and then turn
the strike of the bullets will hurt you
Eye to eye with icecold looks
that make you feel there is danger
they have might to hypnotize
and they will never release you
You search for the stronger
you search for the truth
you're searching so long
wasting your youth
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search for the truth
fight it out if you search for the stronger
fight it out if you search
Search for the stronger of two
Keep cool bleed and fight your fear
Success's laying only in your hands
just try hard the end is near
your name will be sung through the lands
You search for the stronger etc 
Fight it out
if you search for the stronger
fight it out
etc 
You ride on a silver spider
captured in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way to help
You walk through tubes of mistery
you see light at the end
but when you reach the exit
your're cought by thousand hands
You ride on a silver spider
captures in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way
You fall pictures create the lies
You fall but your mind denies
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
don't you lose your dreams tonight
In the night
You sail on a purple ocean
the wind inflates your wings
burned by an old emotion
your wooden sailboat sinks
When flames of memory touch you
you'll see they've burned so long
and deep in a nest in side you
another dream is born
You fall 
Hold on 
You ride on a silver spider 
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on save dreams for me
Look at me nobody cares
Just a mirror passing by
Looked inside
I've lost my pride
Stay with me not for so long
It's alright no needs no hope
Such a miracle
looking back
Times gone by
and life wasn't bad
Lord light my way
Fill these withered
careless hands
Oh skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh skies are falling down
Skied are falling down
See the birds are back
At the docks and everywhere
Here in Lisbon realized
This whole world
so strange and divine
Lord light my way
Fill these withered
careless hands
Oh skies are falling down
Skies are falling down
Oh skies are falling down
Skied are falling down
Sat beside the meadow
Watching weeds agrow
Cleaned up all the ashes
Of my soul
Wrote down my own sentence
Now you take your way
Fades the last remembrance
Of your lovely pretty face
I after all
Just a lonely man  a lonely heart
Working on the future
Floating on fate
Faced the circunstances
Cleared up the shades so
Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting life's been wasted
maybe I wanna die some other day
Hear the whispers of your hope
The answer wasn't told
No don't laugh seeing me cry
The end I've left behind
the whispers of your hope are left behind
Make believe
There's no sorrow in your eyes
Can't you see
We could never get back from the start
Minutes waiting life's been wasted
And I've tried
Maybe you deny
Words of peace
For the future of our lives
Bring to me
Something else than a broken heart
I won't wait 'till my life is wasted
maybe I wanna die some other day
So time is waiting
Now overloaded
See weeping eyes
Let me alone
Angels crying
Back to the war
Angels dying
Rest in their fall
Come to me try to see
future is not what you wished it to be
'cos everyday seems the same
To the whole mankind
sowing the seeds that'll never grow
We're waiting for the dawn
The change must start right now
Oh scars are fading
seeds now may grown
feeding no more lies
raising as the sun
Angels are crying and dying
for holy chants of
fareweel to kings
overthrown by the purpose light
Nobody ships when the glimpse
of your target comes behind you
Trading places with those faces
Won't go far but you must hold on
You don't know what you've got until it's gone
And without fear to disappear
You pay the price for your life
Hope as high as the mountains
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside to stay alive
And face my fears with the will to live
Nothing's easy that will please me
As I search for truth and hold on
To everything I've found in 'til I'm gone
And at the end my life is spent
I'm facing death with the path I went
Hope as high as the mountains
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside to stay alive
And face my fears with the will to live
Desolate
This is becoming
It will take the treasures invested in your soul
As the sky turns red and the oceans boil
Apophis discriminates against no one
To turn sand into glass
We'll be done by midnight
When the sky is turned to stone
And its earth against earth
The death of the sapian
The wise and the faithful
Only the man with the reason
Will this notice be useful
Destroyer of worlds
You can black out the sky
Obscene is the waste of this earth
A celestial body for that it is cursed
More then this plague of man
We yearn for wings and lungs with air
As our reign on earth comes to an end
Suicide in mind for a death before our time
The corruption flow is our fatal crime
So hold your breath until your lungs are wet
We're failing but we're alive
To find your piece of mind
Search in this great divide
They pick the teachings only fit for today
Manmade gods moulded in our only image
Blind faith and myths compose all our history
There was no sin
But the absence of truth in the world
I won't take part in the foolishness held
We die for freedom
Only the wise survive
We die for truth
Paying the price with lives
We abandon this logic at expense to ourselves
We abandon this logic at our expense
Let's watch the suns burn into darkness
They don't all have to be from Earth
Be all from Earth
In the white sky view of the future
When time has told if we are worthy or not
Let's watch the suns burn
In the end when committed to darkness
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run run run
playing out my very last chance to run
taking me down off this cross
lay me down in the dust
where my eyes cant't see
no more sober words of love
this is my last chance to run
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
to live to be alive
just run run run
take a look in the mirror
my mind turns into my heart
I got the shock of my life
movin too fast
just run run run
playing out my very last chance to run
my last chance to run my last chance
I crossed the line
and you know that is hurts
I need to find one reason
the mirror tells me
all I need to know
so I forget it after all
it's all for you
but somehow I my not stop
so I stopped smiling
so I stopped breathing
in all that you did
in all what you are
here I stand
where my past is as far as the sun
in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything
in my head I say your name slowly
for this point in time
my life is going to cave in
in my head I say your name slowly
when I wake up you're gone
I am dreaming in a sweat of fear
just to know you were mine was enough
one big leap in the dark
I think I might have lost it somewhere else
lost something good
and never got it back
I say goodnight in one single breath
and now I can be anything
when you move your hand over my back
this could be the very last time
the very last moment
one moment from somewhere else
only for you
the bright lights shine
but the truth is I am lost for words
my life is going to cave in
at the heart of the matter
just take a closer look
make it easy cause it is
it's all black and white when the music stops
it ends so it begins
sometimes I think I understand
everyday I know that
I may be closer to
to something beautiful
you are tomorrow in today
and you will ever be
the you I know is fading away
no guts no glory
the you I know is fading away
just stand up and be counted
can't say goodbye to somebody you don't know
so it begins so it ends
I think I  understand
sometimes I think I understand
allow me to join your presence
no need to argue even for one second
oh what a beautiful view
the beauty in your eyes
the warmth of your smile
a heart of perfection
I would fight the darkest roads
to protect your shining eyes
these are my unarmed words
but I'm not the one
you're looking at
still I did
but doesn't arise
please don't worry about me
I'm already lost I'm already gone
but you don't love me and I do too
I wish I could
I thought you would
this oppressed soul of mine
got no tears for long time
this is getting wrong
just bear it up and say the truth
as early as your eyes do
this moment will race forever
all my life I was running away
but the sad part is I'm still here
where did I go wrong all along
now I can leave my things behind
cause it's all going off without me
now the time has come
to clear the air and hit the road
damn what we wait for
I've got no time to lose
driving in my old car
mind out
maybe our backlight has gone
for sure we're already drove too far
just leave my grave undone
listen to the voice in the radio
the tragedy starts from the very first spark
all good things come from above
I'm tired from being put off
I didn't really know how to call it
a name to conjure with
you're a little bit more then I thought you'd be
and now you're drowning me
and get lost in the sea
Explanation 
This is about growing up with pain and struggle
Everyone has their own story
Most of my scars are not physical but mental
I wouldn't be who I am without those lessons
You dig a hole 5 days a week
So you can sleep at night So you can sleep
Carry the burden carry the weight
It will drown you one day
And then you'll sleep forever
And your body will rot
Carry the burden carry the weight
It will drown you one day
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
Than be afraid to live
I'd rather be dead
You dig a hole
5 days a week
so you can sleep at night So you can sleep
Carry the burden carry the weight
It will drown you one day
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
You won't get to quench the greed
You won't get to justify the want with the need
You won't get to live beyond your means
Six feet deep
Your body will rot
Coffin keeper
No one will remember your name
Life is so short 
Because it always comes to me
The world turns and I'll forever mourn
And I'm sorry that I wasn't the closest
And I'm sorry but I always cared
I could see this coming a mile away
Didn't do enough to show you another way
I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam
I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam
You needed something to something to hold on to
Give me a reason to breath
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave
Tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
 it's slowly starting to shut me down
When I wake up I feel sick
There is no end to this There is no end
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
Nothing worth keeping comes that easy
This pain this world won't defeat me
Never knew what to say or what to do
To voice these thoughts the best to you
When I wake up I feel sick
There is no end to this
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
When I Wake I feel sick
There Is No End to this
No words to hide the pain behind my eyes
So where do we go from here
give me heaven give me hell give me an answer
ARE WE LOST WANDERLUST
I'm still staring at the sun
screaming out my lungs
I'm staring at the sun screaming out my lungs
When did the compass break
when did we lose our way
give me heaven give me hell give me an answer
ARE WE LOST WANDERLUST
I'm staring at the sun screaming out my lungs
I swear with myself as my witness
that I I'll get through anything
I can get through this
I swear with myself as my witness
Still dying still lying through your teeth
Look at me I still remember everything
And I hope you walk the earth alone
Get those middles fingers up cause
Fuck the government fuck the cops
Fuck authority and fuck the system
And fuck you too if you're fucking with them
On repeat like it's Groundhog Day
Life's short Down for anything
FUCK A FAKE FRIEND
I still remember everything
Get those middles fingers up cause
Fuck the government fuck the cops
Fuck authority and fuck the system
And fuck you too if you're fucking with them
So now the lines been drawn in the sand
this is for real we ain't playing no games
And we felt the same
Now I only see the darkness inside
Only sorrow remains
And I drown in the shame
That I feel better for it
But something cut so deep and you bled out of me
Fuck it's so damn hard Fuck it
A house that used to be a home
Go figure
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
How many years have I known you
How much time have we shared
How many lies have you spilled into the air
you will never know why
I pray
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
I hate this world that I see today
We all have ugly days
I hate this world that I see today
Do you know what it's like to be bested
Have you lost have you fought  not won
Do you know what it's like to be tested
Do you know what it's like to overcome
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can beautiful in every way
We all have ugly days
I hate this world that I see today
We all have ugly days
Stuck inside these walls
Stare through the windows into my soul
Just tell it where to go
It's got no hope  it's got no home
I'm afraid I lost I am worse
No regret No cure I accept this curse
Stuck inside these walls
Stare through the windows into my soul
Just tell it where to go
It's got no hope  it's got no home
I'm afraid I lost I am worse
No regret No cure I accept this curse
Mother father what have I done
Trust me
Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long say farewell
live and let die
It is cliche but every word I truly mean
there is so much beauty to be seen
And you're beautiful too kid
You will be loved you will be warm
And these paths in life are meant to be walked
Believe me
Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long say farewell
live and let die
Just don't give up
Just don't let go
I know you won't
Things are gonna be different kid
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better and everything will change
It will get better and everything will change
Every day
Set the goals embrace the illusion
This ain't the way supposed to be
Confessed yourself to death
And wore your scare on every sleeve
This candied maxim stays the same
This pained reprieve
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
Bury me
In this suit I wear today
Another wasted dream
A dream that fades away
Staring at these walls
Inside this fucking hourglass
Just stand in line
This lonely mile
Is bleaker still
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
It's a long road nowhere
This journeys fate intact
Torn apart
Again and again
Same old lives
Justify your means
To live
Not just remain
Burn
The fire will light the path
Trade for the nightfall
The pattern is so predictable
Another reason to dream in the moment
Not be denied
I'm not a product of circumstance 
Or a name in a line
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
It's this sheltered life that you're living
Try to recognise
Your choked up words
Are empty still
Fight Blood in the throne room
It's over
These towers fall
Blood in the throne room
It's over
This towers fall
Your lies
Pull me down
Same old lies
Pull me down
We're alone
Fear is the change
That brings you down
Blood in the throne room
It's over it's over
Mirror my lesson learned
Tailored for reason
Laid to rest your lies
It bleeds the weak
This shallow empire is built on lives
Lives crushed down as they tried to fight 
This darkened heart will bear no compromise
And with no thought of weakness
Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
The task is simple
Put more coins in the hand
Now hold your tongue
And lay your loyalty down
Born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
Blue blooded tyrants
The faces of sin
They wear the masks
That smile with mercies grin
Black gates protecting
Their fortress of lies
It holds the vial of ink
That scripts our demise
This greed infects
Their blackened hearts are reaping
Gold and green
Amassing as we lose the fight
For now we see an altered shade of real
There's no one left to conquer
You're born a slave
Take the hand of the master
Floods rise all around
Blind our eyes then betray us
In silence we drown
Crusade
To march with a heart filled with rage
A lust for revenge
Traded for blood
Stare as the life drips from the blade
It seals your demise
How easy the hand fits the throat
Your mind so cold and hollow
Will disgrace and destroy
Yet still claim reprieve
So easily
Your faith blinds you all
You the restless martyr
Now receive
A solemn note from callous hands
These are the words you must obey
Take life for belief
Vile actions echo through time
Now raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
Lead the guilty to the rope
Unite and raise the torch
We will never forgive
Never forget
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
Never forgive never forge
Lesson not learned in blood
Are soon forgot
You trail the hounds
That chase your dreams away
Hopeless you are
The vultures lie in wait
Graceless road ahead
Your fate is undisguised
Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again
Dare to fail
The rope's around your neck
Obey the call
When it sounds like hope
Crushed by apathy
You'll forever be lost
Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope
Wake from this nightmare
Step from the ruins
That shadow fates embrace
Break from these chains
That shackle
Rise and prevail
Fight back
This is your welcome to solitude
Dawn fades
Shed your skin
Your sun will set
To rise again
Defy
And see the light reapear
Lest you forget
Without fear inside you'll fail
And see the light reappear
Lest you forget
For as long as you breathe you hope
Lay your dollar down
To pray before me
These words that i'll preach
Are set to stoke the fire
Raise your hands
This gift of hope I give to you
Your faith is my cruel device
Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
For I
The Evangelist
You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Is this the price of belief
Now praise
The souls that give will now be saved
My words are lies laced with disguise
Keep your god
And I His Riches
Bow Down
Before Me
Immortal I stand
You'll never find salvation
No matter what the cost
To not embrace existence
Be forever lost
You'll never find redemption
no matter what the cost
This is the price of belief
What sight to witness
This is darkened room shows no escape
Chaotic bleakness
These thoughts that haunt my will
To be free
A cursed fire burns inside
As I embrace the silence
The peace is fuel for the machine
As I feel
Wrath of fate
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
I'm fighting this solace
I pay my debt with anxious fear
But still I face this
Rising tide of blame
Am I the criminal
Or am I the victim
Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
Am I the liar
In that I must doubt
Is this still real
Am I the noble one
I set them free
Now set me free
Sleep soundly no more
Wrath of faith
These scathing eyes
Cast illusions light
The past is now awake
Feeding on this dark tranquil air
Wasted I am
Wicked we are
Sit the fuck down little boy
I've seen a million like you
And I wish everyone could see
Cold heart and hollow mind
This story's getting so old and dire
It's rehashed pathetic and weak
Wretched you stand
Desperate you'll fall
You'll struggle in vain
Blind hate so unjust
I'm sick of hearing from you
The lies
Your cruelty without a cause
Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed
Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same
Shameless tainted soul
Your tale will never be told
Denied archaic it's echoes are weak
Futile and sick
Where are you heading now
You're future is cursed
Hope for us all
Dies with you
Destined to come crashing down
This road leads to despair
Defeated
Mankind stays the same
Dark reveals
I sense her luring eyes
And her evil intentions
Without a voice
She calls me into her arms
But I feel a cold embrace
The sweet sting of fear
Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of existence
Take my hands
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave
Alone
I fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Towards me she steps 
In silence
Bitter her stare
Can I turn away from this
Our fatal engagement
Come to me
Taste my gift of death
I'll lift the weight of your life
As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternity
Now take my hand
And I will lead you
To the sleep that you crave
As I face the darkness
To fade away
I stand alone
With all my regrets
Will I find the answers
As I fade away
I stand alone
For all eternityRites of death
Rites of undeath
We're falling
We're falling down
I told you we're into deep
Transfer life into what's dead
The act of human playing God
Redoing the acts of medieval
Witchcraft and the worship of dead
We're falling we're falling down
From our throne so supposedly high
When we confront the power great
The might of our own creator
Transfer life into what's dead
The act of human playing God
The rites of undeath
Is the testament of our own death
Enter the halls of distant memory
Feel your previous actions once again
Your lies and deceit
Your hate and long lost love
Walk through the hallway of you past
Sense the evil like a whip from beyond
The doors keep on forever
Possibility is endless
Wander through one of the bronzecovered doors
And feel the weaves of old times cruelty
Run from the darkness the endless void
And get yourself cornered by the demons of fear
The presence of something unseen carries on
Of old time cruelty
the past haunts you
of old times cruelty
save me
has now turned it's way back to you
The demons from the past haunts your soul
Walk through the hallway of your past
sense the evil like a whip from beyond
the doors keep on forever
possibility is endless
Your ideals are wicked and deceiving
how can you find peace
you seek the righteous but find the void
Die by the sword of live by the book
Glimpse your death within the scythe
seek the righteous find the truth
the book of eternal youth
Of generations
cold as stone you wander still
awaiting your inevitable death
your quest has ended where it began
But is there really a life for me
is there a place to dwell
pleasures of the flesh
vio dolorosa
Of fear and despair you've wandered
of hatred and grief you've slaughtered
I've seen you in your darkest hour
I know you as myself
But is there really a life for me
Via dolorosa memento mori
In you I've found my nothing
in you I can't hide my pain
in you my love has gone
in you I've kept my cold
Captor of sin you've stolen my past
via dolorosa
I've wasted my life for you
My hate you create
My blood is water
my life means nothing
my warmth has vanished
The grip no longer holds
When passion abandons
The bonds no longer clutch
And the rope screams you name
A path of daggers
But where to step
A hallway of illusions
Of what was
Duty heavy as a mountain
The battle draws near
Your shoulders carry many
Still death seems remarkably void
You wonder fate in lack of faith
What you consider luck may be God's will
A wanderer of the light will never die
Before God gives his approval
A path of daggers
The crown I carry as an aura above me
Is the proof of who my saviour truly is
My mute cries overheard
My blindness is seen
My tears washed away
My feebleness became my strength
Duty heavy as a mountain
The  battle draws hear
Your shoulders carry many
Still death seems remarkably void
A wanderer of the light will never die
Before God gives his approval
A path of daggers
When love is lost only hate will remain
I am in pain
I am the cursed one
Life is not what it was meant to be
What I didn't ask for has now turned my way
Somewhere in a garden it all turned wrong
Things I once believed in have now turned evil
Yet I pray Deliver me from evil
But another spell pulled me away
Will suicide break the ring of curse
Tomorrow I'll be gone so don't look for me
My life took more than it gave
Betrayed and deceived I will now pass away
And with the gun in my hand my questions
Are soon to be answered
Will suicide break the ring of cure
Satan and god the thought passes my mind
Heaven and hell it's not up to me
If the Christians that I've seen
Represent the true God of heaven
Then it's not a place that I want to be
But if I'm blinded please open my eyes
And help my now
Will suicide break the ring of cure
Tomorrow I'll be gone then you'll be all alone
His seemingly perpetual glance of doom
As he rides he wind being the ghost of gloom
Running darkness all around
A knife in her hand
Fall rising screaming the name of her beloved
So weak and so weary
Something blackening her thoughts
A cloud a force a weight
Finding her true love lying in red
Is this reality or just a vision in her head
To be the knife as well as the wound
Is all that concerns her
Overwhelmed by a burden like hordes of fear
The obscurity of the vale of tears
Grasping for safety which lies all so near
Incresent malice of the vale of tears
Wandering oblivious in the foggy twilight
Shades of an obelisk shines so bright
Incredulous thoughts bewildering her mind
Is there really a god to find
Halting through the darkest of forests
The obese and extraneous at her tail
This haunting lingering to the extreme
She is about to quail
Then a formless mass of black went skyward
She stopped she listened nothing
Silence an eternity passed
The silhouettes of something unseen a presence
The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring
The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring
Recovering of the dead
Impossible for the living
The making of a copy
Is destruction of mankind
The earth is in it's autumn
The leaves have hit the ground
Corroding this earth is dying
Not knowing you'll face the end
The coming of Christ
Is the return of X
The art of the Y
Is in the new spring
My hands in the open wound
The knife clutches near
The blood of my veins spread out
My flesh become soiled
This desperate act of loss
The pain of knowing why
My mind slips into a blur
Upcoming questions as I die
Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled
Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil
Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail
Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled
 as I die
Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil
Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail
Death is my goal / Death set me free
In my living hell I can no longer be
Please bring me back home
Where I can be free
These Cowards Awaken
To guard their dominion
Enslaved to the King
A living sacrifice
Raised to see no light
Known to no other face
He edges near with unsteady hands
Struggling to wield his blade
Advancing forth with reckless force
I witness his dismay
Nearly scythed by his sword flashing forward
Mine finds its way beneath his flesh
He strikes the worst has come
Fallen to my knees he looks on in triumph
He did not see my sword go through his back
No longer will the bell toll
The King will surely know
I watch his eyes go blank
His body falls from my blade
I feel my fingers tremble
As it grows closer
I wait for a chance to escape
It prowls this tomb waiting for new prey
Once human hope has all gone
As I wander through this nightmare
No thoughts cloud my mind
Kill or be killed
I must be the predator tonight
Wasting our lives for this
Fighting a war for nothing
Are we all so mindless
How can we cope with such catastrophe
I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light
Blood is shed and bodies strewn
Across the battlefield
Sons and fathers die in vain
Now I will rise to be their shield
Lay waste to their towering castles
Set fire to these gates
Those who are innocent will escape the storm
And those who have sinned shall pay
With their lives
Fuck their meagre existence
They will be purged
I will take the world by this hand
I can show you what it means to live
I will deliver you from blackness
If you look into the rapturous light
I've had enough of begging
For everything that I want
I'm sick of fighting
For what I've already earned
Dragged through the dirt
Silenced and hurt
When will this come to an end
I shall reclaim what is mine
Just give her back to me don't waste my time
I will reclaim her she's mine
No mercy for you fools who stand in line
This can't be real
My eyes are bloodshot my hands are shaking
What am I supposed to feel
Take my hand or be forgotten or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love
I shall seek you dead or alive
I swear this will be the last time
Cannot forget you you're trapped in my mind
I'm done with trying I'm bringing you home
Take my hand or be forgotten or wait
For the storm to take everything you loved
Come now rest in the chaos or wait
For the storm to take everything you love
She's not real
The flaw in her facade you coward
You drained the very spirit from her eyes
She lies
He invokes the collision of nations
To abuse the crown with false intention
Those who stand above him
Live beneath his reign of terror
He is not royalty he rots beneath the sky
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay
You couldn't run this kingdom
If you felt further than yourself
The might of the world is against you
I'll have your head if it's the last thing I do
I will see you sit upon the throne of decay
This hero begs for incision
He wanders aimlessly
His vision is no longer blinded by his majesty
I've taken everything and yet he still persists
I see her face I can feel her in my arms
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
A phantom follows him wherever he may go
The guilt eats him alive and scars start to show
Revenge won't bring him back
Although red is all he sees
One of us will die tonight
On that we can agree
On that we can agree
I see her face I can feel her in my arms
I've come such a long way
To lose my love before my eyes
He looks to the sky in anguish
I can almost taste his hatred
A fire burns where only I can see
And he will spare no blood to get to me
Our eyes meet there is no turning back
Not now nor ever again
We made the choices that brought us here
We will pay in anger and fear
Forced to do this fucking dance of death
We cut away until there's nothing left
And with his last shred of dignity
He falls down and looks up at me
I am the god the chaos and destruction
Behold the powers of my wrath
I am the sword
The burning blade of vengeance
Your blood in my hands
As I embrace the black fire of the end
Ashes rain upon me when heaven is in flames
I am the bringer of your damnation
The judge and deliverance in one
If I say there shall be darkness
All light will die
I rule the world without a sun
With sorrow I behold the demise
The ruins of empyrium
With sorrow I behold it was fortold
When angels fall we have seen the last dawn
I am counting hours
Waiting for the sun to set below horizon
Blinded by the light until the
Darkness will fall upon me
And I become as one
Last few restless hours
Until the daylight will reach its end
I am granted with great powers
But blinded by the light until the
The pyre of gods black flame within me
Purgatory
The fire of wrath inside
I burn alive
Throw of the scent
To seize the chase of life
When one with death no light in sight
I have been told that before the end
The angels will come angels will come
Years has taken the best out of me
The sharpest edge
Endless burdensome journey without a rest
Murder in cold blood instead of a suicide
This crime is justified
I have killed myself so many times
That for me without a doubt
Heaven is denied
I am here I am waiting In silence
With no fear of dying
No more bleeding inside
Waiting for the black sun to rise
I embrace
The depths of oblivion
I am engaged to the escapeable end
The void that once was a strength
Consuming and fears
Became too intense
Destructive
I behold the days that are numbered
In my perdiction
The end has been forseen
I am unable to accept this failure
As weak as I am
I have no strength in me to pretend
The throne that once
Marked my strength
Is now a token of my failure
I can't recall
That the summer came this year before the fall
Leafs didn't grow on trees grass wasn't green
No lifesigns to be found
It's like a soundscape of silence
The final harvest has become
with bare hands we sowed the fields of ice
Lats crop that died on the ground
Into the frozen soil
Where I bury myself to be reborn
I can't recall
That the summer came this year before the fall
To The land of thousand frozen lakes
Like a snowfall
I have become to question my existence
The purpose of life
The essence of the creature I am
These days will be remembered
As the dark ones
When all life withered away
Death came with me side by side
Our trail across the land
Left only void behind
I have become more than my reflection
I have overcome the sickness
The weakness of my blood
I am the plaque I am the flood
I have become more than a man
Weak flesh seals inside a god
I follow
I walk the trail
Of my shadow
It walks ahead
Leading away
From the light
Darkness walks beside me
Drifting away
In your now so seeking eyes
The taste of confidence
In my mouth
I want to give you
More than I can
Words from you
Is a touching expression
Haunting
Bitterness
Is tearing me down
To be with you
Is to be with the world
Untitled reasons are carried with the wind
But you leave me
With that stolen look of love
These days I hear our hearts beating as one
And you know for me
You will never be gone
Does love come wrapped in lies
Am I flying just to fall
And as I grow older
Life seems so much more colder
It's not a secret of mine
That I want love to really hurt me
Your bright smile at dusk
And all my love is blown to bits
Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you
Our words are so far apart
Mine broken yours full of dreams
But let me find you in those dreams
And take you home tonight
Do you think the sky will ever part
And leave a tiny hope of love
For us to hold on
But to what why or who
Drug me with your lies
I've never wanted more
Dust is dancing in the streets
So like the memory of you
Serenity
And the ice cold feeling
Of an uncertain future
Spark glow in the dark
Waiting for no one
At the halls of tomorrow
Surrender may I
But only if you beat me twice
Beat me twice
I can't see through
Your lies and your crying eyes
your crying eyes
So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die
Would you believe a word I'd say
If it was true
if it was true
Could you challenge your horizons
Into a voice of silence
a voice of silence
Wherever you may fall
I'm falling with you
falling with you
And whenever you may leave
I'm leaving with you
leaving with you
So give me a lifetime
To see right through 
Give me a world to drown
A world to drown in you
Give me thousand summers
Without a sigh
Give me the glowing hope
A hope before I die
And so the day went
We had our time
Now we met at the park in July
I took your hand and held it high
I dreamt that this love
Could be undone
We shared our feelings
We had our moments
Maybe you were the one
No love can ever have a place in me
I'm closing in
On myself
Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate
And so the day went
We had our days
Now we were at the park in July
You took my heart and held it high
I thought that this love
Could now be done
And so the night went
The moon was full
Now we slept at the park in July
We took our lives and nailed them to the ground
I knew that this life
Could now be gone
Don't let this world
Tear you apart
In these moments of love
No you won't be there
To see yourself
In these moments of hate 
Trying to see but can't break through
Silver skies talks to me like ghosts of the past
Ignoring call from electric skies
And the house of cards
Fall to the ground death
Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still lost in the white lines
Seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
A December could only apply to myself
I can go back but I can't move
Temptation can burn
But will I drown
Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
Death seems to whisper these years
Must face it and tell the truth
Must face myself and tell the world
Still seeing through mirrors
And so may I be the next to know
Knowing the times before they are
In these evenings
The blood seems to boil
Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white
I'm still the one I used to be
It's now colder than the freezing mind of you
Alive and glowing
Do I make the same conclusion as you
Do I make my soul clear of this need
Do I jump the gateless ways of winter
Do you ever drown the clean magic in white
Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
And heaven will know the taste of rain
Would you challenge the stairs that I seek
Do you complete the unsaid words
Let me live through myself
No matter where you go you will always be dead
I bring you to the slaughtering of life
I scream goodbye love to a dead world goodbye
You why you loathe me I have become regrets
Why you loathe me I focus on all the pain
I cannot begin to feed endlessly
Low below the ground you will find me
Under grave snow on my head stone
Low below the ground you will find me
I do not want to know anybody's fucking name
I do not want to hear about anyone else's pain
I cannot sustain much of society's ways
Cannot stopcannot trust cannot back away
Keep quiet do not speak only I can say
It is all about you you know it's a fact
It is all about you why is that
Only the enemies know about my revenge
Only few have told the story and lived
Only the ones like this have blood to shed
Only to this world will you always be dead
Cannot escape your own labyrinth of strain
Feebleminded you cannot have what you may
It is all about you you know that's a fact
It is about you why is that
Unknown follow the path I have shown
Capable spite can only be my real label
Face down smell the entrance to my grave
Unrestrained focused to make life my slave
Does he have a plan does he have to live
Why be afraid to be near what is left to give
Does he have to live what is left to give
My beautiful burning hate
Decadence the way I feel about my inner self
Pestilence a sickness I cannot rid of
At peace with the hate in my heart
All this is another focus on my madness
Explain it attempted misery addicted sadness
All this is another focus on my madness
Explain it attempted misery addicted sadness
End time witness end time never alive
Writhe forever always held together
Don't you ever see forbidden agony alive
Love for me died long ago everywhere I look
Of the knowledge of my grandfather's side
the sword is forged and it will be mine
At the dawn I take my horse and pride
and to the victory I will ride
The autumn leaves falling again
Through the eyes of a bird is this scenery seen
How the beauty turns into darkness
And how everything is lost once again
Years have passed since someone grew the flowers
The place was designed for this
Once it was dwelling for a success
She waited for him at the doorway so anxious
She loved him so deeply that she couldn't see
Finally he came and looked right into her eyes
And fired his gun straight into her heart
So crash the dreams of a young one
This life was gone to never return
And that's the sight to haunt him forever
And she sleeps in a silence so cold
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories
The justice is just how it is seen
And she sleeps in a silence so cold
That is the way for a someone
Who doesn't know the game he is in
Straight through the eyes of a bird is this seen
And soon falls the snow covering the memories
The justice is just how it is seen
That keeps going without it
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me
I pull the trigger to escape
I have hated you so much but now I know
It would be pointless forevermore
I've been haunted by the impossible
And blinded by my own eyes
This is the end of me
I pull the trigger to escape
Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world
No difference has been found
Nothing more than dust
Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that canÂ´t be denied are lost
CanÂ´t you see that nothing really matters
CanÂ´t you see what you are doing
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system
So every conclusion is built on empty basis
Hate is the force that controls human nature
Only the fats that canÂ´t be denied are lost
CanÂ´t you see that nothing really matters
CanÂ´t you see what you are doing
The difference between real and what we see
Hope is worth nothing in this pitiful system
So every conclusion is built on empty basis
Taken my time and gotten only what IÂ´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within
Reflection back burns like hell
I didnÂ´t win so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow itÂ´s me who to follow
I shouldnÂ´t have let go no way  I know
Her eyes I see as I close my mind
Opening my soul for her to bind
The riddler comes to me to ask
Do you have to hide behind your mask
I am not the same I used to be
And now I feel painfully free
Have to forget all the rain
Just to recall the infernal pain
People change I know they do
Yet I canÂ´t change my point of view
No answer to all questions asked
So pack your bags and finish the task
and die
Many deeds with no meaning at all
Even so I stand tall
And without a fear I shed no tear
And face what is to come
No more back against the wall
No more roaming the empty hall inside my head
Where all is dead where shines no light ahead
Out in the distance for back lies
The essence of life and highest dreams
Behind the point of knowledge
Where the sense of truth so pure and fine
Is cast into the endless time
Taken my time and gotten only what IÂ´m given
Upon the wall my shadow dim
With my eyes cold as ice in the past I gaze
And sense the rage within
Reflection back burns like hell
I didnÂ´t win so hear my yell
Last in line in the game of life
Betrayed and hollow itÂ´s me who to follow
Yet no pitch black letters shall be written
For the future reveals its curtain
IÂ´ve heard the eager call from down below
But IÂ´ll stand tall not letting go
No pitch black letters
IÂ´ll stand tall
Not letting go
Will let go
Flashbacks from the war
Calm silence before the fight
Snowy road covered in blood
Suicide by my side
You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore
Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished
Hearing echoes from the eternity
Still fighting only the enemy differs
Once a soldier so great now afraid of death
One great enemy of men
Forgotten and buried deep those words will be
Time takes itÂ´s own guaranty's freedom
Never ending everlasting torture of your soul
Old man looking out from the window
Tired face watching the sunset
Still holding the quill in his hands
He knows the story must be finished
Weak fire burning on
And the last chapter is soon ready
But the quill drops from his hands
And the story remains unwritten forever
You are my ender
Cause for my agony
You are my ender
I can not take it anymore
Finally I can see it all so clear
The lies and contorted reality
It took so long to realize it
But now I am free from their chains
I know IÂ´m all alone
But I donÂ´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane
I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the worldÂ´s balance
Because I see it all now
IÂ´ve lost these many years
The lost one whoÂ´s shed too many tears
Must recall revelation in the dark
For past and future for all under my mark
IÂ´ve been drowned IÂ´ve been crowned
IÂ´ve been dead and yet so blind
I have reached the end of my path
The knowledge the wisdom behind my wrath
I thought it was all right then
But now IÂ´ll put an end to it
They knew that one day IÂ´ll find out
ThereÂ´s no way to make it undone
I know IÂ´m all alone
But I donÂ´t care
What is the difference
Between a genius and an insane
I am a reborn genius
One that has waken
The correction in the worldÂ´s balance
Because I see it all now
Everytime I wake up youÂ´re beside me
Every moment I feel you in my arms
But as soon as I open my eyes
You are gone like a frail dust in the wind
Again
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
This is the silent song of the dead
Hear the violins play now And fall
Everytime I wake up I see you there
Every moment I look out of the window
Your smile I see behind the mask
But soon the image disappears and
IÂ´m alone again
IÂ´m alone again
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
When the winds are gathered in one place
When the darkness spreads and no one stands
Never could complete
I walk in the bottomless flood and drown
Drown in the sea of emptiness
Just a word and the last sign of life
Turns into ashes within my hands
The autumn leaves falling again
Through the eyes of a bird is this scenery seen
How the beauty turns into darkness
And how everything is lost once again
Years have passed since someone grew the flowers
The place was designed for this

Waking up every morning is like entering a dream
Sadness is just the gate to my own realm
Walking forward is no longer an option
I am no longer part of this world
No difference has been found
No difference that I made
And though the shadows are everywhere
ItÂ´s all so simple that way
To live again just another day
But we possess something that canÂ´t be found
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
Use all the means to make the world yours again
Infiltrate the core system and poison its heart
We see into the forthcoming day
Our minds are open wide Eyes open wide
And they canÂ´t force us regardless of pain
To be like them again
All these hours were there waiting for you
But the time was running years ahead of you
ThereÂ´s no sign for salvation in the end
There is no gate to let you in
This is the beginning of a new day
So claim the time and lead the way
Heavenly light that now shines ahead
Is the proof of the new beginning and the end
ThereÂ´nothing for you here
Follow your people and leave these lands
The hope has forsaken this place
The ship is waiting for you
Please take my word
Our time here is at its end
To see the future IÂ´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
Leave now thereÂ´s still time for you
Forget your consort itÂ´s time to go
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees
To see the future IÂ´m at the edge of falling
Your glory once so great is now gone forever
And your death is near
Once I was the king of all men
You are the only one left anymore
All the others are gone
Abandoned cities and sinister landscape
Is your kingdom now
And only the forthcoming shadows
Darkness have been fallen upon these lands
And the cold wind blows away
The last leaves from the trees
From time to time I feel the same again
The sorrow and the hate for this world
Many days just thinking all these lies
And all this hatred in me
Many days just thinking all these lies
And I am nothing but a lie
The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program life
Far beyond the light I am
IÂ´m running as fast as I can
But the world slowly fades away
And so do I
The reason is the blade of mine
The answer is the fear of time
The only thing that can kill me
Is the exception in this program life
Is this what we have been searching for
Is this all what we have been waiting for
How can they be so stupid they can not see
And my personal worldend
It doesnÂ´t mean just death
And my last words for the mankind
Are vanished with the world itself
Star of Darkness shine on me
let satanic shadows draw near
the hour of eternal evil here
and I am facing the black circle
see my blasphemous torture
that you lit with darkness
the witches must be gathered
and to stand in your light
star of evil winds shine
let your shadow down on me
hear me cry out infernal names
near the circle of Ninnvam
the black eclipse draws closer
the witches are gathered
I dream fantasies of torture
and fornication before God
Diabolical night dwell our souls
let your evil shadows draw nearer
to possess our immortal flesh
and to breed abominations
You are the shadows dancing in the mist
You are the fire lightening the blackened skies
you goddess of sin
that have torched my soul
you are the lust and essence of my being
you goddess of death
that painted my heart with darkness
you are the hatred running through my veins
you are my hunger for the purest blood
you goddess of vampiric evil
that granted me thy life eternal
You are the pale moonlight reflected in my eyes
you nocturnal goddess
that granted me demonic powers
you are the twilight in the infernal storms
you are the despain in every enemyÂ´s soul
you goddess of war
that gave my life a meaning
you are the blasphemy in every sin
you are the pain called love that I cannot feel
you blasphemic goddes
that killed my emotions
oh you goddess of the eclipse
that dwells within me
oh you apocalyptical goddess
I worhip thee
Standing on a moonlit field
cold rain whipping my skin
warm blood draining me of life
oh I feel my death draw near
The pale moonlight is reflected
in the steel that has opened my veins
my life is now fading away
into the deepest of shadows
now it is time to end this mortal life
I kneel and welcome my death
my eyes are blinded by the fire
which has been feared for centuries
here I will burn for my sins
still there is nothing I regret
death is my deliverance
from this pain called living
with a sigh of relief I die
thrown into the raging fire
laughing as I burn
oh dark ruler of the fallen
this is my final sacrifice
I grant thee my life
The pentagram of my desires fullfillment
glows with inverted unholy inner force
baphomet I draw your sign deep inte my flesh
enter me and use my satanic body for war
Grant me a touch through Leviathan
set fire to my soul of AntiChrist
God of the underworld split open my black heart
fever runs through my blasphemous being
I am my sacrificial gift to the goatlord
I cry out to thee Baphomet appear in me
create a storm of immolation to kill God
possess me now and see all my hatred
I am a human torch of devestation
master of teh grim domains I call your names
while I rape the angels of an impotent God
He weeps like a lamb to the slaughter
cast down from his blooddrenched skies
slowly we sail across the river Styx
and I hold up his head by the hair
the godforsaken water is bloodred
and the ruler of chaos stands ashore
he spreads out his blackened wings
and blasphemes sadistically the priest
I drag the worthless priest ashore
he screams endlessly in naked fear
I am an eternal veil of evil torture
and I take pleasure in his agony
he is being crucified upon a cross
and boiling blood is poured upon him
his face explodes in bursting heat
as I whip his soul a thousand times
Summoning voices from distant fields
calling for magic of Satanic might
In midnight storms and thunder
around flaming stakes the witches dance
A fork of lightening cracks the sky
like a blaze in the winternight
still heard are the hymns
the hymns invocing Satan
The light of day is now cursed by Him
and united is his warrior hordes
the pale cold light of the moon and the stars
now blessed by he who reigns in flames
so creature of the night behold
hold with pride your banners black
and to thos that tremble in fear
His voice speaks with thundering might
I have given life to shadows grim
and blessed this world with darkness
now kneel and swear allegiance to me
Bacterial remnants of humans traverse the stars
As we fall through holes in time
Beneath glares of stars burning
Void of eternal night unfurl
Out beyond the threshold
In worlds yet known to man
Lurking near the portal's gate
Where black holes burn away
VENIT MORS TE SUPERARE
BONUM EST MORTIS MEDITARI
Dimensions shattered by tombs of time
Collapse the galaxy on human life
Outside they wait to cloud the gateway
From beyond I see the nothing
The field which chains all being
Levitated somehow made weightless
Moved by some unknown device
Synthetic gravitational environment
Adrift in the cosmic tide of ice
Lost to the abyssal waves of time
Floating eternally with one open eye
Cryogenically contained living without life
Celestial epitaph for all of mankind
Far below the earth
Beneath the caverns
Beyond the light
Dwells the terrestrial race
And forms of life
Beyond those known to man
Suffocating aura emanating decay
Limbless horror radiates
The fetied reek of plague
Planets burning away
Celestial bodies decay
Planetary funeral
As world go up in flames
Tides of blood for sacrifice
To their alien names
Born of blood and starspawn
In times beneath the earth
Siphoning the life source
but is this the first or the last time again
Opening between the gates on either side
Spiraling Awaken in another mind
Fall Through nothingness
Suffocating
The glass freezes inside your veins
Die Release your flesh to the astral plane
The violent plain of suffering
Your blood has vitrified
Boiling the pulp beneath
Liquefy your mind
Fear the pain
Fire awaits
Buried
Underneath the sand in the desert
Opening how the ancients foretold
Glowing
With the light of god in the temple
Offering thou to the astral beast
They came to mine the planet
For those who live under the ground
Inside the synthetic world we know
As the human mind
These beings are hiding outside of time
Tethering starseeds inside your mind
Corrupting your DNA
To make your soul obsolete
Replicating inside thoughts
To make your inner self fall asleep
Caught between the empty fields of time
And dimensions that are lost
To the worlds we know as real
Feel the bile churning away
Mold the substance
To send through the gate
Cosmic seas of fire traverse the void of space
Bringing human souls from another world
Manipulate the species from inside
Watch them fight and kill
To build the megacemetery urns of the planet
In this lachrymose universe
Of anfractuous dimensions
No death as known
Only doorways
They return back to kill the living
They return back to take this Earth
They return back to take their own world
Now you can see the ancient magick
Now you can see the ancient gods
Now you can see the ancient spirits
Now you can see the ancient gods
When we closed them in the abyss
They said We'll return back
And now they are in front of men
Now they want to take their land
When I look around my life
I see damned souls they don't survive
I see young people they always cry
They have no values don't know the light
In your eyes
Tears of lies
You cry and die
Tears of lies
When I look into your face
I see depression I see no faith
I see young people they always cry
They have no values don't know the light
Rituals magick
I enjoy me with every excess
To free my soul to free my heart
To free my mind of shit
And I know that I will die
I'm waiting to see the end
If you know what is the light
You have no fear of death
I enjoy my life
Yes I know that I will die
And I never cry
But I know that I will die
Die die
Yes I know that I will die
Rituals magick
I prepare me to my return
I prepare my soul I prepare my heart
I prepare me to cry no more
You that try to take
All the stupid men
You would like to put
Your hatred in myself
You don't need a God
You don't need a men
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else
Prince of darkness
You're nothing in my life
Hey prince I know your name
I don't fear all that you say
You like to see the death
You like to see all black
You like to see
The decline of men
You think that I don't know
That you rule this world
But I don't need your help
I don't need someone else
I would like to know
What reality is
I would like to know
What life is for me
'cause I spent all my life
Running behind my dreams
And every time
I ran behind my faith
I ran behind my faith
Sometimes you need someone near of you
Sometimes you need solitude
You can find yourself and you don't need no one
You can find your faith and you can walk alone
I try to know myself
I try with every excess
I try to fall into a trance
I invoke the spirits of dead
When I invoke my spirit guide
I feel his power inside my veins
I feel his knowledge into my brain
And I keep it inside of me behind my faith
Do you believe in a living dead
Do you believe in the other side
Do you believe that we return back
Do you believe that we cannot die
So look at the cemetery
And tell me what you see
In the graves there is nobody
But believe me this is real
The graves are open
The graves are open now
And now we are returning back
To show you what's the life
There is no end with the death
The beginning is in the other side
I don't know where is the knowledge
I want to know where's my conscience
So I look at my heart
And I find all the answers
It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul
I want to know the mean of life
I want to know where's the light
So I look at my soul
And I understand what I am
It's in my heart
It's in my blood
It's in my soul occultum lapidem
I'm not blind and I can see
The great light of my will
I look for peace for my mind
I look for pleasures that I've inside
I that live my spiritual tale
I don't want toopen your eyes
I just want to show you these lies
They try to use your faith and your mind
Stolen faith stolen faith
They say Give us your money and pray
They say You must believe in our faith
I say Give us a reason to pray
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
Resent me
Sworn enemy of the weakened heart
Cursing the miracle
Leech of the sun
Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way
Wage the war
Madness awakes and reveals its face
Truly immeasurable
Hidden in all
Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn
Darkness that will overcome
Insurrection displayed
Mark the path in his flesh
And blast the way
Insane celebration
Salvation's unborn
Violent is the rapture
Blasting the virginborn
Nazarene
I've come to bestow you this crown of scorn
Destined to be cast down
And folded in earth
We're born to reign as masters
To ashes we'll burn the pastures
Repell their ways back to nothingness
Chaos in symmetry
This glorious victory
In darkness only we can see
Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn
Transcend with rage of the elite
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside
Defiled bloodlines severed
The lowlife's doom endeavoured
The sheep of masses trampled under our march
Set out to lead and create
This power indulge our fate
This era calls for annihilation
Our whispers outsound prayers
We claimwhat was never theirs
Sworn to the triumph of darkness
Our name has seen the future
Headshot target now on god
Pointblank crimson dawn
Spew forth tomorrow's spawn
Transcend with rage of the elite
Write new history as we wipe and delete
An urge to rid this world of human waste
Weak aside
Down insects bow to me
Die insects too blind to see
Down disgusting foul flea
Die we remove the life of thee
Foul prayers rise
Staring through the eye of the chasm
Still at rest but breathing
Enemy be born
Grant us knowledge of the opposition
Spew forth from the earth
So sworn
Hibernation draws to a close
Lacerating wings unfold
Hunger will cease
Abominations speak from the dark
Now seek only death
Antichrist
Rise before us
Pain
From inside
Release them
Souls in slavery
Come my saviour now
Face is the one of a reptile
Rotting teeth and lips
Speaking words of sick salvation
Whispering eclipse
Antichrist
Rise before us
Pain
From inside
Release them
Souls in slavery
Come my saviour now
Cast into the lake of fire
Gagged by blood
A thousand deaths unwind
Storming
Perseverance is none
Repenting not
Mass decay of life
Swarming
Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praise
Trapped inside a burning field
Sheep of god
Followers who did not heed
The warning
Unblessing of the purity
Once the norm
Darkness holds the blasphemy
Swarming
Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
Mute the mouth of empty praise
Insanity will reign supreme
Azazel
Belial
Abaddon
Leviathan
Call upon
Call on those we scorn
Raze their faith and feeble ways
Mute the son
Deliverance bygone
At Kellys' I saw the girls slimming
Bringing in tampons drenched in vodka
Then the party started to rocka'
I was sexually aroused
By these naked girls
Inserting their compacted
Tubular shaped pieces of cotton
Into their vaginas and anuses
Yeah
The strings hanging out of their labia
Getting piss drunk
All these fish tacos dripping alcohol
Thought I was in heaven
They were bending over
Showing me their brown eyes
Moisty wet and surely succulent
And I could choose any any slice
So I got out my hard implement
Slimming party at Kellys'
I pushed it hard Up to their bellies
Slimming party at Kellys'
My dick accompanied me in endless rallies
Slimming at Kellys'
Think this trend is a good thing
Slimming at Kellys'
Hell of a night full of swingUp on the hill
looking down at me
The hoards are waiting
for the guilty to be
Sentenced to death
Blood sport
feel the thrill of the chaise
Heart is fit to bursting
at the deadly pace
Hard to draw breath
I am the prey
it's jungle law
Fight to survive
tooth fang and claw
Wild dogs behind
see snarling jaws
Running man
breaking free
The hounds of hell
are after me
The gibbet waits
or to take my head
Will I make it
Or will I be dead
I'm the running man
I'm the running man
I am yeah
Running man
I'm the running man
Understand
In for the kill
sprint for the line
Can't break my will
race against time
Life flashing by
Hunted the pack
are closing in
I hear them howling
Maybe I can't win
but I've gotta try
I swore an oath
dragged to the floor
My ghost will haunt
this windy moor
Forever free
through blood and gore
Running man
breaking free
The hounds of hell
are after me
The gibbet waits
or to take my head
Will I make it
Or will I be dead
Nobody helped me
nobody even knows my name
Fighting bravely
even though I died in vain
Whoa
Running man
breaking free
The hounds of hell
are after me
The gibbet waits
or to take my head
Will I make it
Or will I be dead
I'm running still
On this cold and lonely
wiley windy hill
The seer has a message
it spells out a warning
Foretold of evil
from times early dawning
Lilith is her name
she'll drive you insane
From hell spawn she came
to find you
She tells you damnation
is nothing to fear
Proclaims revelations
is already here
Black are her eyes
beguiling with lies
With blood lust she cries
let the night games begin
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Daughter of darkness
banished from Eden
She is the succubus
lays down with demons
Lucifer's child
restless and wild
A harlot defiled
blind fool
Queen of seduction
bewitching the priests
Lust and corruption
the mark of the beast
Haunting your dreams
insidious schemes
She laughs at your screams
the nightmare won't end
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
She'll take you to the alter
like a human sacrifice
Easy virtue incarnate
she's a mistress of the night
Priestess of seduction
she's all your body needs
Eat you alive
fuck you till you bleed
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Whore of Babylon
Roll on up take a look at me
just a sideact novelty
Circus clown in the public gaze
nameless horror to be
feared and caged
Behind this mask of deformity
there's a son of humanity
Formed by natures twisted hand
they call me monster
But I'm a man
Everything I touch
everything I see
Everything I feel
crumbles before me
I am not a dog
I do all I can
Can't you understand
Wanna fit in with the likes of you
Set me free
let me go
Want to belong
I need to grow
But you treat me like a
freak show
Freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show
Freak show
Mirror your insecurity
imperfect scarred
just leave me be
Need a place where I can hide
no one sees the wretch inside
Stripped of pride and dignity
mocked by cruel society
Thought you were my only friend
now I can see you just pretend
Everything I knew
everything I crave
Everything I do
brings me closer to my grave
Too grotesque to live
but too young to die
Madness cruelty reigns
torment clouds my brain
Hatredwhy is it so
Need to belong
someone you should know
But you treat me like a freak show
Freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show
Freak show
What do you want from me
Cut me do I not bleed
I'm every bit as good as you
Out castbeat down betrayed
Lost in a world I never made
I'm insane after all they put me through
Set me free
Let me go
Want to belong
I need to grow
Oh they can't even look me
Right in the face
Subhuman
Let me show you
the creature I've become
The evil that torments the soul
when prejudice is done
Freak show
I'm nothing but a Freak show
Freak show
Freak

You treat me like a freak show

I'm nothing but a Freak show

Voice over
Roll up roll up

Ladies and gentlemen

Too bad the boy can't sing
but kids today'll buy anything
Sweet meat
supplying trash on demand
for a few dollars more
In the back of a hand
You'll go far It's true
every two bit actors
a rock n' roll star
In the charts on the news
with millions screaming
all over you
It's Prime Time
Media saturation

Doing prime time
Slave to convention
overnight sensation

You'll find

Red hot the kid can play
but where's the pay off
at the end of the day
Looses heart
playing one night stands
Never got a deal
soon quit the band
He was good
goes to show
It ain't what you do
it's who you know
That's the catch 22
when the doors are closed
you'll never break through
It's Prime Time
Media saturation

Doing prime time

You'll find
were all doing prime time
It's a fashion reaction
Pigeon hole philosophy
The people only get
what we want them to see
Gonna sell 'em the illusion
till it hurts and they'll pay
A little bit of hype goes a long
long way
Foundations of rock
Have feet of clay
Gone tomorrow

Doing prime time

Prime time honey
Never pay no heed to those
who oppose my lifestyle
Feel no remorse for the wrong
that I've done
I constantly abuse all who try
to use me
Like a fallen angel banished
from the sun
Cause I'm the Night Stalker
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attack
Prowling these streets at night
I fight a deadly game of survival
Stealing through the concrete
jungle with bloodlust in my
brain
All here fear me I'm ruthless
as I'm godless
A preadtor of the side walk in
his alleyway domain
Cause I'm the Night Stalker
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
poised for attack
Society brands me a homicidal
madman but they cannot
cage what they cannot see
When I'm coming you as
good as a dead man
Ain't no one alive that can
elude me
Cause I'm the Night Stalker
feel the cold caress of knife
Stealthily advancing to cut out
your life
Yeah the Night Stalker assassin
at your back
Skulking in the shadows
The only sound I hear is my tired heartbeat
Sometimes I feel just like a motherless child
This place once had a name
The people once had faces
Sometimes I feel just like a countryless man
The county correct me from my wild ways
I once saw figures about a mile off
So I waited in the woods until they were gone
Sometimes I feel just like a wandering dog
The county correct me from my wild ways
Struck down by a vision of beauty
Said I was struck down by a long legged archer
Oh the city was hot but my blood ran cold
Oh the city went dark keep calm and carry on
I was a young man only 19 years old
I was a young man so very far away from home
I want to be an old man damn you von Braun
I've been laid low by a blinding light
I've been torn asunder by the banshee's wail
I was a young man only 19 years old
I was imprisoned by a vision of beauty
I was struck down by the long legged archer
Suited for telescoping the interstellar scene
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts
Anthrax ham radio and liquor
What if I told you they been lying
About that double wide with water rights
And now the town cars are back again
They sold you some old line
About the greater good and sacrifice
Your friends from Langley are back again
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts
Anthrax ham radio and liquor
Coming at you live
It's just some people can only see the stars
In the reflection from big black cars
It's a reliable source of information
Fifty thousand unstoppable watts
Oh Abraham Lincoln carried across the street
Oh Abraham Lincoln carried across the street
The assassin the coward
shot him in the head
The assassin the serpent
Struck him then he fled
Snickering drunkards from cover of dark
Treachery's their master
murder is their heart
From the table rips his chair
Cross the people on the stairs
Watch the limbs running for
All across a empty bar
Oh Abraham Lincoln buried him in his grave
Oh Abraham Lincoln buried him in his grave
The assassin the coward no grave for you
The assassin the actor no applause for you
From the table rips his chair
Cross the people on the stairs
Watch the limbs running for
All across a empty bar
In a city of crooked alleys
Crookeder women and wicked men
Dim lamps in the rumor mill
Suspicious kith and unkind kin
Haruspectre General
Sleeping soldiers in the field
Below the elders conspire
To turn the merciless and massive wheel
Locked in among skeletons
Broken hearted and damned
Sorry to have to break it to you friend
But life seldom goes exactly as we plan
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them
The city's always thriving
Hungry bellows of the Minotaur
Everyday more are arriving
And everyday it requires more
Unexpected circumstance
We must not delay
You have all been so very very kind to us
And we will return the favor one day
Fate is the idiot's excuse
Freedom is the sucker's dream
But we hope you find some measure of comfort
In considering us to be your family
Peculiar manner and strange dress
Who will ever dare to tell them
In the raining park the chessmen play
The faithful atheists refuse to pray
The steamworks weep the addicts do not care
Crowd of cold people stand by and stare
The garbage eaters their many retainers
Come to collect all the foul remainders
The smoke hangs heavy the wrecking ball swings
In the clockwork of a collapsing thing
The hourglass is turning
On a shore of iron cutters and clippers
Paper rock rock paper and scissors
On a road of skulls their story moves on
It's a bumpy ride and very very very long
In the blue sky the seagulls fly over garbage
Are we the ocean Are we the desert
Are we the garbage Who's to say
I'm gonna move to the outskirts of town
Where none of your friends are hanging around
Where none of your business is hanging around
I'm gonna build a castle out of Goodyear tires
Gonna dig a mote Fill it up with ale
What kind of ugly are they talking about
It's just straight up cold evil
What kind of nonsense are they going on about
Do they suffer from the fever
Nothing's gonna satisfy them
Till it all goes Chernobyl
No nothing's ever really gonna satisfy them
Until the virus goes mobile
If you didn't then well now you know
Outside is an army of antlers
I hate to say it but I told you so
Only the freaks have all the answers
Red threat Helicopters SuperMindControl
Stockholm Syndrome Love your captors
Uranium SuperMindControl
It's gonna rain rain down in buckets
Watch it happen a natural fact
They're gonna lose and their not gonna like it
Watch it happen Supernatural act
I send pictures through the mail
Well documented and very detailed
To politicians and big celebrities
But none of them are believing in me
And I await their response
Some send none most send cops
But man it's a dire situation
And I will risk the public humiliation
Sleestak lightning on my trail
It's a dire situation they are on my trail
West Virginia has its Moth Man
Pan handlers' got their Skunk Ape
But I have a tazer and night vision goggles
Costco rolls of black duct tape
It's got red eyes it's got razor claws
It's got green skin no it ain't a methhead
All roads lead me to selfdestruct
Veins are maps paving way to the abyss
Up is down and from this there is no escape
Drown down and out
Gates without keys eyes without holes
Life without answers a corpse with no soul
My race to the grave is my birth given duty
My race to the grave is my birthright
My inborn malignance manifests failure complete
I know I'll never leave this shitball alive
This name dies with me
This depravity this futility
It's synonymous with family
Fuck you forever and fuck me
I deny both idols and hope
I reject this holy hoax
At the end of my noose
Fuck the son long live the beast
A vendetta for revenge and bloodlust to die
My advice Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death
Who would call this shitball home
Who wouldn't be best served
By feasting at the funeral knell
Who hungers not for decay
My advice Start saving for your funeral
It's the only true bet
The only handout ever is the reaper's hand
Outstretched in death
The preaching of psalms denied
Extinguish the light it shines no more
Of servitude and supplication
Bring on nuclear winter
Feast
Drown in silence and servitude
Requiems for the lifeless
Damnation and downfall
The two gifts of life
Feast
Extinguish the light it shines no more
Bring an end to this curse
Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed
The power of mercy is now extinct
Blackgloved hands knives to throats
These are the new messiahs
Strip nude for your killer
The best place to hide is in plain sight
No guilt for the consumed
Putrid breath of life how I hate you
You burn all you touch with gifts dual
Of misery and awakening
A rotting sentence that walks and kneels
All that prays kneels and dies
Arms outstretched on bended knee
All that walks kneels prays and dies
Tongues of ice tongues of fire
All shall burn in the funeral pyre
Arms outstretched pray and die
We exhalt
Let us hold hands united in the great uncoming
Of that which is perfect
We bow great bringer of night
Choronzon's dawn we embrace you
Offer forth the benevolent
Tentacle of futility
Whispers of obliteration echoing nigh
Bring down the summer of finality
We huff your rot now come forth
And carry us home
Bear benevolent gifts of decimation
Our congregation of the end
Welcomes you
Forever and never of ways
And impossible
Great breaker of worlds
To thee great king
Let us be your vessels
For the great uncoming
Always and impossible
Great destroyer of life
We huff your rot
The tragedy of the excommunicated
Forever and ever always impossible
Soliloquies written in blood
As we were all born so shall
we die alone
Baptised in scars crowned in agony
Conceived with the futile notion of the self
could ever ascend
Rip the skies asunder to draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
Shower mortals with the remains of their kin
There is nothing left worth saving
And even less worth dying for
The ultimate blessing is silent sleep
Forever as it was once foretold
Rip the skies asunder and draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
Dog eats dog eats man eats self
The packing order of the leprous
Fundaments of failure embodied in man
Begotten signs of faith drop lifeless
Under the velvet of no promised tomorrow
Rip the skies asunder draw them down
End this curse of flesh and blood
O great lord shower us with shit and piss
O great lord give meaning to this outrage
O great lord bear the vestige of the atom
O great lord in glory Annihilus
O great lord let me consume your suffering
O great lord I inhale your pestilence
O great lord shower us with your death
O great lord
We are all but blood on Satan's claws
Rain down plague to wash down famine
Bathe us in the waters of death
Shower us with fire eternal
The cleansing when all became none
Congregate flagellate
We the downtroden beg you
Correct this most grave of mistakes creation
We who exhalt in the end worship it
We beg for baptism in blood in sinew
Snuff us out
Burden us not with the disease of tomorrow
Wrap us instead with black wings of sorrow
No prayers sent up to an empty sky
Sink for fangs deeper into our necks
We who exhalt in the end worship it
Baptise us all with blood
Baptise us with humanity's eulogy
The end when all became none
In case of rapture the car might be unmanned
But the gun tower won't be
Send us back to the vapor of the ether
Rain down plague
When all became nonewe were born without eyes 
and the sockets were just break proof safes 
read these books and diaries 
that's how they said we could start clean 
then pray on knees that judge and blame
If I could better myself I swear I would
I swear to god I'd fucking change myself 
My veins are turning a dark blue
I feel like dying how about you
Take the coins out from under your tongue
Drown drown I'd fucking drown without you
If I said you were the only one
who could pull me out of this one
would you think it was fiction
I don't remember the good ones from the bad 
But it's too late because 
I can't hold back from the bucket of bruises
Drink the youth
Drink the youth
The stomach holds heavy circulations 
Our scariest secrets and pleasures
Fuck us front to back
We could build a city in a single day 
but in a couple of seconds we would try 
to bury our regrets
So grab my chest and slip your fingers
because its all about to end
They said we might not come back from this one
but who fuckin' cares
at least it will make us into humans
Shape my legs until they walk on order
shape my eyes so they wont tear up on command
because its worth more than your breath
So what if your teeth hold a grudge
so what if your grinning means nothing 
I bit my own hand clearly right off
The cursed no one can change us
The spells no one can take us 
I'm tired of your breaking downs
The heavies hearts can keep from breaking down
churning grinding itself into slumber
A plague on both your plans
Burn the quakers 
learn
don't catch fire
burn
What's that father father
It wasn't gravity it was the witches
Make your fingers into pillars 
hold all the stomachs in this town 
they can't stomach anymore 
The wood on these trees smell like skin now 
and old fires are full of carpenter stories
It wasn't gravity it was the witches 
The last time we spoke we ended up no where
and it seems like my words
aren't any better than your quotes 
our speeches were reversed
just like the movements of our hands 
with every sentence I became more afraid
because through this mirror
I thought my words would come out backwards
